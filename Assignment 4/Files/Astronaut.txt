professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists.12  starting in the 1950s up to 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut  contents  1 definition  2 terminology  2.1 english  2.2 russian  2.3 chinese  2.4 other terms  3 space travel milestones  3.1 age milestones  3.2

people from 36 countries have reached 100km or more in altitude of which 549 reached low earth orbit or beyond.5 of these 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit to either lunar orbit the lunar surface or in one case a loop around the Moon6 three of the 24 did so twice jim lovell john young and eugene Cernan.7 the three astronauts who have not reached low earth orbit are spaceplane pilots joe walker mike melvill and brian binnie  as of 17 november 2016update, under the us definition 558 people qualify as having reached space above 50 miles altitude of eight X-15 pilots who exceeded 50 miles in altitude only one exceeded 100 kilometers 62 miles.5 space travelers have spent over 41,790 man-days man-years in space including over 100 astronaut-days of spacewalks.89 as of 2016, the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka who has spent 879 days in space.10 peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman 377 days.11  terminology  see also astronaut ranks and positions  in 1959, when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos space while the prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred which survived by common usage as the preferred american term.12 when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961, they chose a term which anglicizes to  english  in english-speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut.13 the term derives from the greek words stron meaning and nautes meaning the first known use of the term in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story deaths head meteor in 1930. the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy gregs 1880 book across the zodiac referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de linfini of j-h rosny an the word astronautique was used the word may have been inspired by an older term for an air traveler first applied 1784 to balloonists an early use in a non-fiction publication is eric frank russells poem astronaut in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary Society.14  the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year.15  nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut Corps.16 the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut Corps.17  russian  main article soviet space program  see also list of cosmonauts  by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts.16 the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt russian pronunciationksmnaft one who works in space outside the earths atmosphere a space traveler,18 which derives from the greek words kosmos meaning and nautes meaning other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonauta  coinage of the term kosmonavt has been credited to soviet aeronautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian among the soviet cosmonaut or nasa astronaut corps to make a spaceflight on march 14, 1995, norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first cosmonaut  chinese  main article chinese space program  see also list of chinese astronauts  official english-language texts issued by the government of china use astronaut while texts in russian use in official chinese-language texts hng yun navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts and tin yun navigating personnel is used for chinese astronauts the phrase kng rn is often used in hong kong and Taiwan.23  the term taikonaut is used by some english-language news media organizations for professional space travelers from China.24 the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as hybrid of the chinese term taikong and the greek naut the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft.25 this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program.26 the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998, chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroups.2728  other terms  with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies  while no nation other than the russian federation previously the former soviet union the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organisation hope to launch a spacecraft in 2018 that would carry vyomanauts coined from the sanskrit word for space  space travel milestones  yuri gagarin first human in space  valentina tereshkova

training in 1959.55 early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots.5657 the earliest astronauts for both america and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots  once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasas neutral buoyancy Laboratory.156 astronauts-in-training may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the comet the nickname given to a pair of modified KC-135s in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a C-9 which perform parabolic flights.55 astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft this is mostly done in T-38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are done out of edwards air force base  nasa candidacy requirements  be citizens of the united

space medicine  astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury.66676869707172737475 a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space and biomedical research institute to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this studys techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare.767778  a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space.79 more recently in 2017, bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space.80 microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space.8182  on december 31, 2012, a nasa-supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimers disease.838485  in

around 0.12 kilograms 0.27 pounds longer-duration missions require more food  shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes five months before flight menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure formula on earth the average american uses about 35 gallons liters of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons liters per day.90  insignia  in russia cosmonauts are awarded pilot-cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation
