storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of the hurricane were from a tropical disturbance near the west coast of africa on August20. two days later the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of cape verde for the next few days the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity it is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August26, about halfway between the lesser antilles and cape verde initially the storm was elongated although beginning on August28 it began to intensify more quickly that night the storm attained hurricane status and many nearby ships reported gale force winds.1  on August29, the hurricane passed north of the lesser antilles as it approached the southeastern bahamas it underwent rapid deepening in a 24hour period beginning late on August29, the winds increased from 105mph to 150mph it also became a small storm as grand turk island reported winds of 56mph while the hurricane passed slightly to the north on August30. at 0130UTC the next day a ship near mayaguana reported a barometric pressure of 930mbar and hurricane-force winds the pressure would ordinarily suggest winds of 152mph but because it was not reported in the eye and the storm was smaller than normal the winds were estimated at 160mph the hurricanes winds rank as a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale one of two such storms in the 1933 season.1  after maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, the hurricane began weakening as it passed through the southern bahamas at around 1200UTC on September1, the hurricane made landfall on northern cuba near sagua la grande with winds of about 120mph the eye moved along the northern coast of cuba crossing over matanzas shortly thereafter the storm exited into the straits of florida and late on September1 the hurricane passed about 16mi north of havana after entering the gulf of mexico the hurricane restrengthened and a ship reported a pressure of 948mbar late on September2 this suggested winds of about 140mph the hurricane turned more to the west on September3, and as it approached southern texas it weakened slightly as it decelerated at 0400UTC on September5, the hurricane made its final landfall on south padre island in southern texas with winds estimated at 125mph it quickly weakened over land as it crossed into northeastern mexico and the storm dissipated late on September5.1  impactedit  rainfall totals in south texas  throughout its path the hurricane killed at least 179people collectively in the turks and caicos islands cuba and south Texas.2 it first affected the turks and caicos producing winds of 54mph on grand Turk.3  before the hurricane struck cuba officials warned of the impending storm and military workers warned people to remain indoors.4 about 4,000people evacuated the coastal town of isabela on three trains specifically run for the residents in havana business owners secured their properties in anticipation of the storm.5 most of the deaths from the hurricane occurred in northern cuba winds of over 115mph affected the coastline and havana reported maximum winds of 94mph there the winds downed power lines and uprooted trees high waves flooded six blocks of the city with up to 4ft of water entering the cellars of some homes.4 east of havana in crdenas high waves destroyed the aqueduct while high winds severely damaged the local sugar industry a nearby coastal town 20mi east of crdenas was described as being leveled by the storm in news reports.6 in cienfuegos along the southern coast the hurricane destroyed many ships and piers.4 high waves washed four ships ashore one of which damaged another ship.7 high winds destroyed hundreds of houses and damaged many others along the storms path.8 about 100,000people were left homeless many of whom lacking food or medical supplies.9 in the interior of the country the hurricane dropped rainfall that flooded rivers and towns.10 damage was estimated at and a report published in 2003 indicated that there were about 70deaths in the country11 however newspaper accounts from shortly after the hurricane indicated there were around 100deaths.12 after the storm police officers were deployed to maintain order.4 officers shot and killed five people caught looting in havana although the deaths were not included in the overall death toll.13 officials deployed trucks to pick up wounded citizens.14  while the hurricane was over the bahamas late on August30, the united states weather bureau issued storm warnings for southern florida two days later the storm struck cuba and passed south of the state producing peak winds of 42mph in key West.3 the winds caused little damage however high waves destroyed a sea wall and washed onto a coastal roadway high waves also sank a boat killing three people.15  three days before the hurricane made its final landfall officials at the weather bureau in brownsville issued a warning to all stations along the texas coast declaring that it was where tropical storm in gulf will reach coast line but all persons should be warned to remain away from inaccessible places on texas coast over week end the early warning was to prevent travelers from being on the texas beaches on labor day weekend as a result an official at the corpus christi weather bureau office estimated that the warning saved thousands of lives early on September4 about a day before landfall the weather bureau issued a hurricane warning from corpus christi to freeport and storm warnings for other locations along the texas coast when the storms westward motion became more apparent the hurricane warning was dropped north of corpus christi and extended southward to Brownsville.3 officials in corpus christi declared martial law before the storm struck and ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas shelters opened in the city and many businesses closed.16  when the storm moved across the area winds were estimated at 90mph in Brownsville,3 with gusts to 125mph high tides were reported along the coast,15 and the storm surge reached 13ft near brownsville the tides flooded portions of corpus christi about 3ft deep sinking boats and damaging piers storm-generated waves destroyed 20buildings in one settlement the storm destroyed the causeway from padre island to flour bluff and there were over 40breaches in the island,17 some up to a mile wide.16 the storm dropped heavy rainfall from southern texas through northeastern Mexico,18 peaking at over 15.0in at a station near mercedes the total was one of four 24hour precipitation records set by the storm.17 the rains from the storm and two previous hurricanes led to a large increase in tropical butterfly species across the area.18 throughout the rio grande valley the strong winds destroyed about 90 of the citrus crop.17 overall the hurricane left in damage and 40deaths, mostly in cameron County.1517 however none of the deaths were in brownsville or corpus christi which was credited to the advance warning.3 damage was less than expected in corpus christi and many business owners who lost revenue sent letters of outcry to the weather bureau headquarters however the bureau determined that the evacuations and warnings were warranted given the storms threat.16  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  list of texas
