can play video game is the most common form today and for this reason the two terms are often mistakenly used synonymously other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld

mainstream use was the text-based teletype game teletype games lack video display screens and instead present the game to the player by printing a series of characters on paper which the player reads as it emerges from the platen practically this means that each action taken will require a line of paper and thus a hard-copy record of the game remains after it has been played this naturally tends to reduce the size of the gaming universe or alternatively to require a great amount of paper as computer screens became standard during the rise of the third generation computer text-based command line-driven language parsing teletype games transitioned into visual interactive fiction allowing for greater depth of gameplay and reduced paper requirements this transition was accompanied by a simultaneous shift from the mainframe environment to the personal computer  examples of text-based teletype games include  the oregon trail the earliest versions  Trek73  dungeon  super star trek  adventure the earliest versions  zork the earliest versions  electronic handheldsedit  main article handheld electronic game  the earliest form of dedicated console handheld electronic games are characterized by their size and portability used to play interactive games handheld electronic games are often miniaturized versions of video games the controls display and speakers are all part of a single unit and rather than a general-purpose screen made up of a grid of small pixels they usually have custom displays designed to play one game this simplicity means they can be made as small as a digital watch which they sometimes are the visual output of these games can range from a few small light bulbs or led lights to calculator-like alphanumerical screens later these were mostly displaced by liquid crystal and vacuum fluorescent display screens with detailed images and in the case of vfd games color handhelds were at their most popular from the late 1970s into the early 1990s. they are both the precursors to and inexpensive alternatives to the handheld game console  examples of handheld electronic games include  mattel auto race  simon  merlin  game watch  bandai lcd solarpower  entex adventure vision  lights out  pinball machines and similar devicesedit  main article pinball solid-state era  since the introduction of electromechanics to the pinball machine in 1933s contact pinball has become increasingly dependent on electronics as a means to keep score on the backglass and to provide quick impulses on the playfield with bumpers and flippers for exciting gameplay unlike games with electronic visual displays pinball has retained a physical display that is viewed on a table through glass similar forms of game such as pachinko have also become increasingly dependent on electronics in modern times  examples of pinball games include  the addams family  indiana jones the pinball adventure  star trek the next generation  list of pinball machines  redemption games and merchandisersedit  main article redemption game  redemption games such as skee ball have been around since the days of the carnival game well earlier than the development of the electronic game however with modern advances many of these games have been re-worked to employ electronic scoring and other game mechanics the use of electronic scoring mechanisms has allowed carnival or arcade attendants to take a more passive role simply exchanging prizes for electronically dispensed coupons and occasionally emptying out the coin boxes or banknote acceptors of the more popular games  merchandisers such as the claw crane are more recent electronic games in which the player must accomplish a seemingly simple task remotely controlling a mechanical arm with sufficient ability to earn a reward  examples of redemption games include  whac-a-mole  skee ball modern electric versions  examples or merchandisers include  claw crane  slot machinesedit  main article slot machine  the slot machine is a casino gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed though slot machines were originally operated mechanically by a lever on the side of the machine one arm instead of an electronic button on the front panel as used on todays models many modern machines still have a lever in addition to the button on the front slot machines include a currency detector that validates the coin or money inserted to play the machine pays off based on patterns of symbols visible on the front of the machine when it stops modern computer technology has resulted in many variations on the slot machine concept  audio gamesedit  main article audio game  an audio game is a game played on an electronic device such asbut not limited toa personal computer it is similar to a video game save that the only feedback device is audible rather than visual audio games originally started out as accessible-games but recent interest in audio games has come from sound artists game accessibility researchers mobile game developers and mainstream video gamers most audio games run on a computer platform although there are a few audio games for handhelds and video game consoles audio games feature the same variety of genres as video games such as adventure games racing games etc  examples of audio games include  real sound kaze no regret  chillingham  bbbeat  video gamesedit  main article video game  a video game is a game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device the word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device.1 however with the popular use of the term game it now implies any type of display device  arcade gamesedit  main article arcade game  see also golden age of arcade video games  electronic video arcade games make extensive use of solid state electronics and integrated circuits in the past coin-operated arcade video games generally used custom per-game hardware often with multiple cpus highly specialized sound and graphics chips andor boards and the latest in computer graphics display technology recent arcade game hardware is often based on modified video game console hardware or high end pc components arcade games may feature specialized ambiance or control accessories including fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with force feedback controls dedicated lightguns rear-projection displays reproductions of car or plane cockpits and even motorcycle or horse-shaped controllers or even highly dedicated controllers such as dancing mats and fishing rods these accessories are usually what set modern arcade games apart from pc or console games and they provide an experience that some gamers consider more immersing and realistic  examples of arcade games include  galaxy game  pong  space invaders  galaxian  pac-man  battlezone  donkey kong  street fighter ii  mortal kombat  fatal fury  killer instinct  king of fighters  time crisis  dance dance revolution  drummania  house of the dead  computer video gamesedit  main article pc game  a personal computer video game known as a computer game or simply pc game is a video game played on a personal computer rather than on a video game console or arcade machine the vast majority of computer games today are video games and since the earliest days of the medium visual displays such as the cathode ray tube have been used to relay game information  console gamesedit  main article console game  see also video game console  a console game is a form of interactive multimedia used for entertainment the game consists of manipulable images usually sounds generated by a video game console and displayed on a television or similar audio-video system the game itself is usually controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to the console called a controller the controller generally contains a number of buttons and directional controls as analog joysticks each of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen the display speakers console and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as a handheld game console  console games are most frequently differentiated between by their compatibility with consoles belonging in the following categories  traditional console also called console a multi-game system that uses the screen of a television to produce graphics  handheld game console a multi-game system the screen and controls of which are compacted into a single handheld device  dedicated console a single game system of either the plug and play variety or the lcd game  educational console a multi-game console supporting primarily educational games these consoles are often simplified for use by children  within these categories the systems are differentiated between by their manufacturer and generation to the year of their release console games are also often differentiated by game genre  hybrid or combined gamesedit  game hybridization refers to the integration of an interactive electronic component into a game a or game is any tabletop game where an electronic device andor application is an element crucial to the gameplay.2 these games are a catalyst for creating new game mechanics important consequences of this technology are the possible substitution of the gamemaster or person who leads a game for an application or device which can be more fair with less room for bias cheating or favouritism and can be intelligently randomised the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in games greater randomisation of events possibility of conducting fast and advanced mathematical calculations making some complex games easier or available to a wider group of consumers and enhanced player immersion with the aid of various stimuli like sound or animation.3  one may categorize hybrid games as follows  purpose-built devices where the game uses a device that has certain functions an electronic dice or spinner to play out the game an example would be electronic banking by hasbro where all players have an electronic card which carries virtual monopoly currency and use a machine to increase and deduct their earnings  beacon technology games are mobile digital games that employ ble low energy beacons to track and control players movements and actions an example artifact technologies created a mobile digital board game called battlekasters where players physically walk around to cast spells or unlock cards  augmented reality board games that interact with a mobile device and immerse the player in the virtual environment through animation sound andor vibrations example roar by Trefl,6 which utilises sound as part of the gameplay  otheredit  electronics have been adapted for use in a wide range of applications board games such as dark tower for instance rely heavily upon electronics non-traditional electronic games such as rubiks revolution or electronic toys which blur the boundaries between games and toys such as the electronic magic 8 ball date Ball7 or the electronic ouija Board8 are often considered electronic games as well  electro-mechanical gamesedit  main article arcade game electro-mechanical games  these were types of arcade games similar to arcade video games but relying on electro-mechanical components to produce sounds or images rather than a cathode ray tube screen.9 these were popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but video games eventually overtook them in popularity during the golden age of video arcade games that began in 1978.  a popular early example was segas periscope in 1966.10 it was an early submarine simulator and light gun shooter,11 which used lights and plastic waves to simulate sinking ships from a submarine.12 sega later produced gun games which resemble first-person shooter video games but were in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to the ancient zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen.9 an early example of this was the light gun game duck Hunt,13 which sega released in 196914 it featured animated moving targets on a screen printed out the players score on a ticket and had sound effects that were volume controllable.13  non-human gamesedit  with the development of technology geared toward electronic entertainment of animals pets video games for pets have also been created since the majority of animals lack opposable thumbs the fine motor skills required for use in most gaming is unavailable to these animals furthermore the visual perception of many animals is influenced by a different visible spectrum than humans.15 techniques that de-emphasize manual control and visual components have been developed to circumvent these problems beginning with the development of television for pets.1617 from this point developers have branched out into the realm of electronic games with such products as mice arena mice chicken petman and cyberpounce cats.181920  referencesedit  gaming apparatus and method united states patents retrieved 2008-06-25.  regan l
