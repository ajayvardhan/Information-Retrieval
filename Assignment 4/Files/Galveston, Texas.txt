main article history of galveston texas  exploration and 19th century developmentedit  plan of the city of galveston texas 1845  map of city of galveston 1904  galveston island was originally inhabited by members of the karankawa and akokisa tribes who called the island auia the spanish explorer cabeza de vaca and his crew were shipwrecked on the island or nearby in november 1528,5 calling it de malhado of bad fate they began their years-long trek to a spanish settlement in mexico City.6 during his charting of the gulf coast in 1785, the spanish explorer jos de evia named the island villa glvez or glveztown in honor of bernardo de glvez y madrid count of Glvez.6  the islands first permanent european settlements were constructed around 1816 by the pirate louis-michel aury to support mexicos rebellion against Spain.7 in 1817, aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against spain to find galveston occupied by the pirate jean Lafitte.7 lafitte organized galveston into a pirate he called anointing himself the islands of government.8 lafitte remained in galveston until 1821, when the united states navy forced him and his raiders off the island.89  in 1825 the congress of mexico established the port of galveston and in 1830 erected a customs house.10 galveston served as the capital of the republic of texas when in 1836 the interim president david g burnet relocated his government there.10 in 1836, the french-canadian michel branamour menard and several associates purchased 4,605 acres of land for to found the town that would become the modern city of Galveston.111213 as anglo-americans migrated to the city they brought along or purchased enslaved african-americans some of whom worked domestically or on the waterfront including on riverboats  in 1839, the city of galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the congress of the republic of Texas.1314 the city was by then a burgeoning port of entry and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of german immigrants to texas including jewish merchants.15 together with ethnic mexican residents these groups tended to oppose slavery support the union during the civil war and join the republican party after the war  during this expansion the city had many in the state with the founding of institutions and adoption of inventions post office naval base texas chapter of a masonic order cotton compress catholic parochial school academy insurance company and gas lights  during the american civil war confederate forces under major general john b magruder attacked and expelled occupying union troops from the city in january 1863 in the battle of Galveston.17 in 1867 galveston suffered a yellow fever epidemic 1800 people died in the city.18 these occurred in waterfront and river cities throughout the 19th century as did cholera epidemics  the beach hotel catered to vacationers until a fire in 1898.  the citys progress continued through the reconstruction era with numerous construction of the opera house and orphanage and installation of telephone lines and electric lights having attracted freedmen from rural areas in 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 3,000,21 made up mostly of former slaves but also by persons who were free men of color and educated before the war the comprised nearly 25 of the citys population of 13,818 that year.22  during the post-civil-war period leaders such as george t ruby and norris wright cuney who headed the texas republican party and promoted civil rights for freedmen helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in galveston and in Texas.2324 cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during reconstruction the freedmens bureau was headquartered here german families sheltered teachers from the north and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read its business community promoted progress and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.25  by the end of the 19th century the city of galveston had a population of 37,000. its position on the natural harbor of galveston bay along the gulf of mexico made it the center of trade in texas it was one of the nations largest cotton ports in competition with new Orleans.26 throughout the 19th century the port city of galveston grew rapidly and the strand was considered the regions primary business center for a time the strand was known as the street of the South.27 in the late 1890s, the government constructed fort crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries in galveston and along the bolivar roads in february 1897, the uss texas old hoodoo the first commissioned battleship of the united states navy visited galveston during the festivities the ships officers were presented with a silver service adorned with various texas motifs as a gift from the states citizens  hurricane of 1900 and recoveryedit  further information galveston hurricane of 1900 and open era of galveston  memorial marker along the strand historic district indicating a building that survived the 1900 hurricane  on september 8, 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane.28 this event holds the record as the united states deadliest natural disaster.2829 the city was devastated and an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 people on the island were killed.28 following the storm a 10-mile long 17 foot high seawall was built to protect the city from floods and hurricane storm surges a team of engineers including henry martyn robert rules of order designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintained  sunset route seawall galveston texas c 1907  the city developed the city commission form of city government known as the plan to help expedite recovery.30  despite attempts to draw investment to the city after the hurricane galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity development was also hindered by the construction of the houston ship channel which brought the port of houston into competition with the natural harbor of the port of galveston for sea traffic to further her recovery and rebuild her population galveston actively solicited immigration through the efforts of rabbi henry cohen and congregation bnai israel galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the galveston movement that between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 eastern european jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the northeastern united States.31 additionally numerous other immigrant groups including greeks italians and russian jews came to the city during this period.32 this immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island as well as many other areas of texas and the western us  though the storm stalled economic development and the city of houston developed as the regions principal metropolis galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries in 1905 william lewis moody jr and isaac h kempner members of two of galvestons leading families founded the american national insurance Company.33 two years later moody established the city national bank which would become the moody national Bank.3435  during the 1920s and 1930s, the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination.3637 under the influence of sam maceo and rosario maceo the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the balinese room which offered entertainment to wealthy houstonians and other out-of-towners combined with prostitution which had existed in the city since the civil war galveston became known as the city of the Gulf.38 galvestonians accepted and supported the illegal activities often referring to their island as the state of Galveston.3940 the island had entered what would later become known as the era.41  the 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the island city during world war ii the galveston municipal airport predecessor to scholes international airport was re-designated a us army air corps base and named army air field in january 1943, galveston army air field was officially activated with the 46th bombardment group serving an anti-submarine role in the gulf of mexico in 1942, william lewis moody jr along with his wife libbie shearn rice moody established the moody foundation to benefit and future generations of texans the foundation one of the largest in the united states would play a prominent role in galveston during later decades helping to fund numerous civic and health-oriented programs.42  postworld war iiedit  the end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of las vegas nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island.43 finally in 1957, texas attorney general will wilson and the texas rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city.44 as these vice industries crashed so did tourism taking the rest of the galveston economy with it.45 neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward.46  downtown galveston as viewed from the air  the islands economy began a long stagnation many businesses relocated off the island during this period however health care insurance and financial industries continue to be strong contributors to the economy by 1959, the city of houston had long out-paced galveston in population and economic growth beginning in 1957, the galveston historical foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings.47 the 1966 book the galveston that was helped encourage the preservation movement restoration efforts financed by motivated investors notably houston businessman george p mitchell gradually developed the strand historic district and reinvented other areas a new family-oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years  with the 1960s came the expansion of higher education in galveston already home to the university of texas medical branch the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the texas maritime academy predecessor of texas am university at galveston and by 1967 a community college galveston college had been established.48  in the 2000s, property values rose after expensive projects were completed and demand for second homes by the wealthy increased it has made it difficult for middle-class workers to find affordable housing on the island.50  hurricane ike made landfall on galveston island in the early morning of september 13, 2008 as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110miles per hour damage was extensive to buildings along the seawall.51  after the storm the island was rebuilt with investments in tourism shipping and continued emphasis on higher education and health care notably the addition of the galveston island historic pleasure pier and the replacement of the bascule-type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical-lift-type drawbridge to allow heavier freight.5253  geographyedit  further information galveston island and galveston bay  galveston from the international space station  the city of galveston is situated on galveston island a barrier
