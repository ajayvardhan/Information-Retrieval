hurricane is a british single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s1940s that was designed and predominantly built by hawker aircraft ltd for the royal air force although overshadowed by the supermarine spitfire the aircraft became renowned during the battle of britain accounting for 60 percent of the raf air victories in the battle and served in all the major theatres of the second world war  the hurricane originated from discussions during the early 1930s between raf officials and british aircraft designer sir sydney camm on the topic of a proposed monoplane derivative of the hawker fury biplane despite an institutional preference for biplanes at the time and repeated lack of interest by the air ministry hawker chose to continue refining their monoplane proposal which resulted in the incorporation of several innovations that would become critical to wartime fighter aircraft such as a retractable undercarriage and the newly developed rolls-royce merlin engine in late 1934, the air ministry placed an order for hawkers monoplane on 6 november 1935, the prototype hurricane K5083, performed its maiden flight  in june 1936, the hurricane was ordered into production by the air ministry the type entered squadron service on 25 december 1937. the manufacture and maintenance of the aircraft was greatly eased by its use of conventional construction methods which enabled squadrons to perform many major repairs themselves without much external support the hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the second world war in september 1939, by which point the raf operated a total of 18 hurricane-equipped squadrons the aircraft quickly found itself being heavily relied upon to defend against the vast and varied german aircraft operated by luftwaffe including dogfighting with the capable messerschmitt bf 109, across multiple theatres of action it is perhaps best known for its contribution to britains home defences during the battle of britain  the hurricane evolved through several versions and adaptations resulting in a series of aircraft which acted as fighters bomber-interceptors fighter-bombers called and ground support aircraft further navalised versions which were popularly known as the seahurricane received modifications that enabled their operation from ships some of these were converted to be used as catapult-launched convoy escorts known as by the end of production in 1944, in excess of 14,583 hurricanes had been completed at least 800 that had been converted to a sea hurricane configuration3 and around 1,400 that had

of just 13 squadrons each equipped with either the hawker fury hawker demon or the bristol bulldog all biplanes furnished with fixed-pitch wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages.45 at the time there was an institutional reluctance towards change within the air staff according to aviation author francis k mason some senior figures were prejudiced against the adoption of monoplane fighter aircraft while mid-level officers were typically approachable on the subject and design concepts that made use of such configurations.5  in 1934, the british air ministry issued specification F.730 in response to demands within the royal air force for a new generation of fighter aircraft earlier during 1933, british aircraft designer sydney camm had conducted discussions with major john buchanan of the directorate of technical development on a monoplane based on the existing Fury.6 mason attributes camms discussions with figures within the raf such as squadron leader ralph sorley as having provoked the specification and some of its details such as the preference for armaments being installed within the wings instead of within the aircrafts nose.7  camms initial submission in response to F.730, the hawker P.V.3, was essentially a scaled-up version of the fury biplane.8 however the P.V.3 was not among the proposals which the air ministry had selected to be constructed as a government-sponsored prototype after the rejection of the P.V.3 proposal camm commenced work upon a new design involving a cantilever monoplane arrangement complete with a fixed undercarriage armed with four machine guns and powered by the rolls-royce goshawk engine the original 1934 armament specifications for what would evolve into the hurricane were for a similar armament fitment to the gloster gladiator four machine-guns two in the wings and two in the fuselage synchronized to fire through the propeller arc by january 1934, the proposals detail drawings had been finished but these failed to impress the air ministry enough for a prototype to be ordered.9  camms response to this rejection was to further develop the design during which a retractable undercarriage was introduced and the unsatisfactory goshawk engine was replaced by a new rolls-royce design initially designated as the PV-12, which would subsequently go on to become famous as the merlin engine in august 1934, a one-tenth scale model of the design was produced and dispatched to the national physical laboratory at teddington a series of wind tunnel tests confirmed the aerodynamic qualities of the aircraft were in order and in september 1934, camm again approached the air ministry this time the ministrys response was favourable and a prototype of the monoplane was promptly ordered.10  prototype and trialsedit  an early mock-up for the hurricanes fuselage showing side fuselage-mounted synchronized machine gun like earlier british biplane fighters  in november 1934, the air ministry issued specification F.534 which drawing on the work of squadron leader ralph sorley called for new fighter aircraft to be armed with a total of eight guns however by this time work had progressed too far to immediately modify the planned four-gun installation by january 1935, a wooden mock-up had been finished and although a number of suggestions for detail changes were made construction of the prototype was approved and a new specification was written around the design in july 1935, this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns.117  by the end of august 1935, work on the airframe performed at hawkers kingston upon thames facility had been completed and the aircraft components were transported to brooklands surrey where hawker had an assembly shed on 23 october 1935, the prototype was fully re-assembled.7 ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks on 6 november 1935, the prototype K5083 took to the air for the first time at the hands of hawkers chief test pilot flight lieutenant george Bulman.12 bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing philip lucas flew some of the experimental test flights while john hindmarsh conducted the firms production flight trials.13 as completed the prototype had been fitted with ballast to represent the aircrafts armament prior to the acceptance of the final multi-gun wing armament.14  by march 1936, a total of ten flying hours had been performed by the prototype covering all major portions of the flight envelope early flight testing had gone reasonably well especially in light of the trial status of the merlin engine which had itself yet to achieve full flight certification at this time and thus severe restrictions had been imposed upon use of the engine.7 in early 1936, the prototype was transferred to raf martlesham heath suffolk to participate in initial service trials under the direction of squadron leader d f anderson sammy wroath later to be the founding commandant of the empire test pilot school was the raf test pilot for the hurricane his report was favorable stating that aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices and proceeded to praise its control response.15  K5083, the prototype photographed before its first flight in november 1935  in the course of raf trials despite the merlin engine proving to be problematic having suffered numerous failures and necessitating several changes enthusiastic reports were produced in the aircraft and its performance figures the trials had observed the aircraft to possess a maximum level speed of 315 mph at an altitude of 16,200ft, a time-to-climb to an altitude of 15,000ft from takeoff of 5.7 minutes and a stalling speed of 57 mph marginally higher than the gladiator biplane the last achieved using its flaps.7  in the course of further testing it was found that the hurricane had poor spin recovery characteristics in which all rudder authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder.16 hawkers response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived but the air ministry refused the request17 the situation was resolved by the royal aircraft establishment who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder this discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.18  in early 1936, the hawker board of directors had decided in the absence of official authorisation and at company expense to proceed with issuing the design drawings to the production design office and to commence tooling-up for a production line capable of producing a batch of 1,000 Hurricanes.1920  productionedit  hurricane production line 1942  trainee aircraft fitters working on instructional partly-assembled hurricanes circa 19391940  in june 1936, the hurricane was formally ordered into production the air ministry having placed its first order that month for 600 aircraft.16 on 26 june 1936, the type name which had been proposed by hawker was approved by the air ministry an informal christening ceremony for the aircraft was carried out during the following month during an official visit by king edward viii to martlesham Heath.2116  a key reason for the aircrafts appeal was its relatively simple construction and ease of manufacture in comparison to the supermarine spitfire it was significantly cheaper and involved less labour requiring 10,300 man hours to produce versus 15,200 for the Spitfire.22 as a large-scale war was looking increasingly likely and time was of the essence in providing the raf with an effective fighter aircraft it was unclear if the more advanced spitfire would enter production smoothly while the hurricane made use of well-understood manufacturing techniques.22 this factor was equally applicable for its use within service squadrons as well which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the hurricane and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops.22 a fabric-covered wing patterned upon traditional hawker designs was initially adopted in order to speed up production a higher-performing stressed-skin metal wing took its place in late 1939.16  on 12 october 1937, the maiden flight took place of the first production hurricane i which was powered by a merlin ii engine and flown by flight lieutenant philip lucas production deliveries had been delayed by roughly six months due to a decision to equip the hurricane only with the improved merlin ii engine while the earlier merlin i had been prioritised for the fairey battle and the hawker Henley.16 by the following december the first four aircraft to enter service with the raf had joined no 111 squadron stationed at raf northolt by february 1938, no 111 squadron had received 16 Hurricanes.16 upon the outbreak of the second world war nearly 500 hurricanes had been produced which had equipped a total of 18 squadrons while a further 3,500 aircraft were on order.2324  during 1940, lord beaverbrook who was the minister of aircraft production established an organisation in which a number of manufacturers were seconded to repair and overhaul battle-damaged hurricanes the civilian repair organisation also overhauled battle-weary aircraft which were later sent to training units or to other air forces one of the factories involved was the austin aero companys cofton hackett plant another was david rosenfield ltd based at barton aerodrome near manchester  a major manufacturer of the hurricane was canada car and foundry at their factory in fort william ontario canada facilitys chief engineer elsie macgill became known as the of the Hurricanes.24 the initiative was commercially led rather than governmentally but was endorsed by the british government hawker having recognised that a major conflict was all but inevitable after the munich crisis of 1938, drew up preliminary plans to expand hurricane production via a new factory in canada under this plan samples pattern aircraft and a complete set of design documents stored on microfilm were shipped to canada 22 early british-produced hurricanes were transferred to support the development.24 as a result canadian-built hurricanes were shipped to britain to participate in events such as the battle of Britain.24  overall some 14,000 hurricanes and sea hurricanes were produced.3clarification needed the majority of hurricanes were built by hawker produced the type until 1944, while hawkers sister company the gloster aircraft company constructed 2,750. the austin aero company completed 300 hurricanes canada car and foundry was responsible for the production of 1,400 hurricanes designated as the mk x  in 1939, production of 100 hurricanes was initiated in yugoslavia by zmaj and Rogoarski.25 of these 20 were built by zmaj by april 1941. recognising that the supply of british-made merlin engines might not be guaranteed it was decided to fit one of the yugoslavian hurricanes with a daimler-benz db 601 engine instead this aircraft was test flown in 1941.24 in 1938, a contract for 80 hurricanes was placed with faireys belgian subsidiary avions fairey sa for the belgian air force it was intended to arm these aircraft with an arrangement of four 13.2mm browning machine guns three were built and two flown with this armament by the time of the blitzkrieg in may 1940, with at least 12 more constructed by avions fairey armed with the conventional eight rifle calibre machine gun armament.2624  designedit  mk i in france november 1939, showing original fabric-covered outer wing and two-bladed propeller  underside view of R4118, a preserved hurricane from the battle of britain  the hawker hurricane is a low-wing cantilever monoplane outfitted with retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for the pilot.27 a clean single-seat fighter it was developed to provide a competent combatant for aerial combat against the latest fighter designs that were emerging amongst the air services of other powers of the era the hurricane was initially armed with an arrangement of eight remotely-operated wing-mounted browning machine guns intended for conducting rapid engagements.28 the hurricane was typically equipped for flying under both day and night conditions being provided with navigation lights harley landing lights complete blind-flying equipment and two-way radios upon its entry to service much of the performance data was intentionally concealed from the general public but it was known that the type possessed a speed range of 61.29  though faster and more advanced than the rafs current front line biplane fighters the design of the hurricanes construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes.30 hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior.31 the primary structure comprised a warren truss box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin cross-bracing which were mechanically fastened instead of welded.32 over this a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape which carried a doped linen covering the majority of the external surfaces were linen save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.33  similarly a simple steel tube structure in the nose of the fuselage was used to support the engine detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engines areas for inspection or adjustment purposes.34 installed underneath the fuselage the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level an atypical feature for the era was the use of tungum pipes throughout the cooling system.34  initially the structure of the hurricanes cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars which possessed considerable strength and stiffness.35 the wing was described by aviation publication flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts forming separate units between the front and rear spars hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings.36 the original wing was predominantly fabric-covered like the fuselage while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge the majority of the flight control surfaces such as the frise-type ailerons also had fabric coverings.36  an all-metal stressed-skin wing of duraluminium derd specification similar to AA2024 was introduced in april 1939 and was used for all of the later marks.12 metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was 80mph higher than the fabric-covered ones they were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings one trials hurricane L1877, was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing the great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath.37 several fabric-wing hurricanes were still in service during the battle of britain although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair changing the wings only required three hours work per aircraft.37  the hurricane was furnished with a laterally-retracting undercarriage the main undercarriage units being able to slide into recesses within the wing.34 hinged telescopic vickers-built legs are attached to the bottom boom of the wings forward spar but with a complex angle setup within the wing at the top of the strut to allow the strut to be angled forwards when extended and rearwards when retracted to clear the forward spar a hydraulic jack served to actuate the undercarriage folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted.34 two separate hydraulic systems one being power-operated and the other hand operated are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage in the event of both failing pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place deploying the wheels to the position using weight alone a wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed.38  the prototype and early production hurricanes were fitted with a watts two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller flight commented of this arrangement have expressed surprise that the hurricane is not fitted with variable-pitch airscrews.29 the original two-bladed propeller was found to be inefficient at low airspeeds and the aircraft required a long ground run to get airborne which caused concern at fighter command accordingly trials with a de havilland variable-pitch propeller demonstrated a reduction in the hurricanes take-off run from 1,230 to 750ft to 230m. deliveries of these began in april 1939 this was later replaced by the hydraulically operated constant-speed rotol propeller which came into service in time for the battle of Britain.39  then with tail trimmer set throttle and mixture lever fully forward and puffs of grey exhaust smoke soon clearing at maximum rpm came the surprise there was no sudden surge of acceleration but with a thunderous roar from the exhausts just ahead on either side of the windscreen only a steady increase in speed in retrospect that first hurricane sortie was a moment of elation but also of relief apart from the new scale of speeds that the pilot had to adapt to the hurricane had all the qualities of its stable secure biplane predecessor the hart but enhanced by livelier controls greater precision and all this performance  roland beamont a trainee pilot describing his first flight in a Hurricane.40  camms priority was to provide the pilot with good all-round visibility to this end the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage creating a distinctive silhouette pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing this was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage just behind the cockpit when the flap was shut the footstep retracted into the fuselage in addition both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material  an advantage of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding even if one of the steel tubes were damaged the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield damage to a stressed skin structure as used by the spitfire required more specialised equipment to repair.41 the old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions crated hurricanes were assembled at takoradi in west africa and flown across the sahara to the middle east theatre and to save space some royal navy aircraft carriers carried their reserve sea hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed  in contrast the contemporary spitfire used all-metal monocoque construction and was thus both lighter and stronger though less tolerant to bullet damage with its ease of maintenance widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics the hurricane remained in use in theatres of operations where reliability easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance typically in roles like ground attack one of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the hurricane and the spitfire were also to be used as night fighters the hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night and shot down several german aircraft on night raids from early 1941 the hurricane was also used as an aircraft patrolling german airfields in france at night to catch bombers taking off or landing  operational historyedit  pre-waredit  yugoslavian hurricane mark i  by the middle of 1938, the first 50 hurricanes had reached squadrons and at that time it had been assessed that the rate of production was slightly greater than the rafs capacity to introduce the new aircraft which had already been accelerated.42 accordingly the british government gave hawker the clearance to sell excess aircraft to nations that were likely to oppose german expansion as a result there were some modest export sales made to other countries at the earliest opportunity a former raf hurricane i was dispatched to yugoslavia for evaluation purposes.42 shortly after this evaluation an order for 24 hurricane mark is for the royal yugoslav air force was received this was followed by the purchase of a production licence for the hurricane by Yugoslavia.25 yugoslavia hurricanes saw action against the luftwaffe during the invasion of yugoslavia in 1941 by the axis powers.24  hurricane production was increased as part of a plan to create a reserve of attrition aircraft as well as re-equip existing squadrons and newly formed ones such as those of the auxiliary air force expansion scheme e included a target of 500 fighters of all types by the start of 1938. by the time of the munich crisis there were only two fully operational raf squadrons of the planned 12 to be equipped with Hurricanes.43 by the time of the german invasion of poland there were 18 operational hurricane squadrons and three more that were in the process of convertingcitation needed  the phoney waredit  personnel of 85 sqn next to a hurricane i lille seclin france on 10 may 1940  the hurricane had its first combat action on 21 october 1939, at the start of the phoney war that day a flight of 46 squadron took off from north coates satellite airfield on the lincolnshire coast and was directed to intercept a formation of nine heinkel he 115B floatplanes from 1KFlGr 906, searching for ships to attack in the north sea the heinkels had already been attacked and damaged by two spitfires from 72 squadron when six hurricanes intercepted them which were flying at sea level in an attempt to avoid fighter attacks the hurricanes shot down four of the enemy in rapid succession 46 squadron claiming five and the spitfire pilots two.44  in response to a request from the french government for the provision of 10 fighter squadrons to provide air support air chief marshal sir hugh dowding commander-in-chief of raf fighter command insisted that this number would deplete british defences severely and so initially only four squadrons of hurricanes 1, 73, 85 and 87, were relocated to france keeping spitfires back for defence.45 the first to arrive was No.73 squadron on 10 september 1939, followed shortly by the other three a little later 607 and 615 squadrons joined them.46  after his first flight in october 1939, hurricane pilot roland beamont subsequently flew operationally with 87 squadron claiming three enemy aircraft during the french campaign and delivered great praise for his aircrafts performance  throughout the bad days of 1940, 87 sqn had maintained

which became tried and tested and rapidly spread throughout fighter Command.46  on 6 november 1939 pilot officer pv ayerst from 73 squadron was the first to clash with a messerschmitt bf 109. after the dogfight he came back with five holes in his fuselage.49 flying officer e j kain a new zealander was responsible for 73 squadrons first victory on 8 november 1939 while stationed at Rouvres.50 he went on to become one of the rafs first fighter aces of the war being credited with 16 kills on 22 december the hurricanes in france suffered their first losses three of them while trying to intercept

continent and return to great britain on the same day halahan requested the repatriation of the pilots serving in 1 squadron during the previous 10 days the unit had been the most successful of the campaign it had claimed 63 victories for the loss of five pilots two killed one taken prisoner and two hospitalised 1 squadron was awarded ten dfcs and three dfms during the Blitzkrieg.59 on the evening of 21 may the only hurricanes still operational were those of the aasf that had been moved to bases around Troyes.60  during the 11 days of fighting in france and over dunkirk from 1021 may

dunkirk the luftwaffe suffered its first serious rebuff of the war as galland has noted the nature and style of the air battles over the beaches should have provided a warning as to the inherent weaknesses of the luftwaffes force structure admittedly the germans fought at a disadvantage although positioned forward at captured airfields the bf 109 was at the outer limits of its range and possessed less flying time over dunkirk than did the and operating from southern england german bombers were still located in western germany and had even farther to fly thus the luftwaffe could not bring its full weight to bear so that when its bombers hammered those on the beaches or embarking the raf intervened in a significant fashion german aircraft losses were high and british fighter attacks often prevented german bombers from performing with full effectiveness both sides suffered heavy losses during the nine days from may 26 through june 3, the raf lost 177 aircraft destroyed or damaged the germans lost 240. for much of the luftwaffe dunkirk came as a nasty shock fliegerkorps ii reported in its war diary that it lost more aircraft on the 27th attacking the evacuation than it

first raf ace of the war got word that he was to return to england for leave at an operational training unit on leaving his airfield he put on an impromptu aerobatic display and was killed when his hurricane crashed after completing a loop and attempting some low altitude rolls.67  initial engagements with the luftwaffe had showed the hurricane to be a tight-turning and steady platform but the watts two-bladed propeller was clearly unsuitable at least one pilot complained of how a heinkel 111 was able to pull away from him in a chase yet by this time the heinkel was obsolete.37 at the start of the war the engine ran on standard 87 octane aviation spirit from early 1940, increasing quantities of 100 octane fuel imported from the us became available.6869 in february 1940, hurricanes with the merlin ii and iii engines began to receive modifications to allow for an additional 6psi of supercharger boost for five minutes there are accounts of its use for 30 minutes continuously.70  the extra supercharger boost which increased engine output by nearly 250hp gave the hurricane an approximate increase in speed of 25 to 35mph to 56kmh, under 15,000ft altitude and greatly increased the aircrafts climb rate or the plug a form of war emergency power as it was called in later second world war aircraft was an important wartime modification that allowed the hurricane to be more competitive against the bf 109E and to increase its margin of superiority over the bf 110C, especially at low altitude with the boost the merlin iii was able to generate 1,310hp at 9,000ft  flight lieutenant ian gleed of 87 squadron wrote about the effect of using the extra boost on the hurricane while chasing a bf 109 at low altitude on 19 may 1940 were flat out as it is here goes with the titn 5 a jerk boosts shot up to 12 pounds speeds increased by 30 mph im gaining ground 700, 600, 500 yards give him a burst no hold your fire you fool he hasnt seen you yet...70 gleed ran out of ammunition before he could shoot the 109 down although he left it heavily damaged and flying at about 50ft 6  hurricanes equipped with rotol constant-speed propellers were delivered to raf squadrons in may 1940, with deliveries continuing throughout the battle of britain according to aviation author david donald the rotol propeller had the effect of transforming the hurricanes performance from to mediocrity modified aircraft were reportedly much sought after among squadrons which had also been equipped with hurricanes that were fitted with the older de havilland two-position propeller.7273  battle of britainedit  hurricane i of 1 sqn flown by plt off av clowes  at the end of june 1940, following the fall of france the majority of the rafs 36 fighter squadrons were equipped with Hurricanes.74 the battle of britain officially lasted from 10 july until 31 october 1940, but the heaviest fighting took place between 8 august and 21 september both the supermarine spitfire and the hurricane are renowned for their part in defending britain against the luftwaffe generally the spitfire would intercept the german fighters leaving hurricanes to concentrate on the bombers but despite the undoubted abilities of the spitfire it was the hurricane that scored the higher number of raf victories during this period accounting for 55 percent of the 2,739 german losses according to fighter command compared with 42 per cent by Spitfires.75 on 8 august 1940, hurricanes of no 145 squadron were recorded as having fired the first shots of the battle of Britain.76  another thing we did was to devise a manoeuvre which was aimed at getting us out of a difficult corner if we ever got into one this may sound very extraordinary probably to practising pilots today but it consisted of putting everything into the left hand front corner of the cockpit if you saw a 109 on your tail and it hadnt shot you down at that point you put on full throttle fine pitch full left rudder full left stick and full forward stick this resulted in a horrible manoeuvre which was in fact a negative g spiral dive but you would come out of the bottom with no 109 on your tail and your aeroplane intact  roland beaumont describing how a hurricane can get away from an Me109.77  as a fighter the hurricane had some drawbacks it was slightly slower than both the spitfire i and ii and the messerschmitt bf 109E, and the thicker wing profiles compromised acceleration but it could out-turn both of them in spite of its performance deficiencies against the bf 109, the hurricane was still capable of destroying the german fighter especially at lower altitudes the standard tactic of the 109s was to attempt to climb higher than the raf fighters and them in a dive the hurricanes could evade such tactics by turning into the attack or going into a dive which the 109s, with their lower rate of roll found hard to counter if a 109 was caught in a dogfight the hurricane was just as capable of out-turning the 109 as the spitfire in a stern chase the 109 could evade the Hurricane.78  in september 1940, the more powerful mk iia series 1 hurricanes started entering service although only in small numbers.79 this version was capable of a maximum speed of 342mph  the hurricane was a steady gun platform,81 and had demonstrated its ruggedness as several were badly damaged yet returned to base but the hurricanes construction made it dangerous if it caught fire the wood frames and fabric covering of the rear fuselage allowed fire to spread through the rear fuselage structure easily in addition the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat right in front of the instrument panel without any form of protection for the pilot many hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel this became of such concern to hugh dowding that he had hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the hurricanes with a self-expanding rubber coating called Linatex.82 if the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it.83 some hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings although they were protected with a layer of linatex were vulnerable from behind and it was thought that these not the fuselage tank were the main fire risk.8485  groundcrew refuelling a hurricane mk i of 32 sqn raf biggin hill bromley london august 1940  from 10 july to 11 august 1940, raf fighters fired at 114 german bombers and shot down 80, a destruction ratio of 70 per cent against the bf 109, the raf fighters attacked 70 and shot down 54 of these a ratio of 77 per cent it has been suggested that part of the success of the british fighters was possibly due to the use of the de wilde incendiary round.86  the hurricane with the highest number of kills during the battle of britain was P3308, a Mk1, flown between 15 august and 7 october 1940 by raf pilot archie mckellar of 605 Squadron.87 he is credited with 21 kills 19 of those in a hurricane during the battle of britain on 7 october he is credited with shooting down 5 bf 109s, making him one of only 2 raf pilots other brian carbury of new zealand to become an ace in a day during the battle of Britain.8889 during his brief fighting career mckellar earned the dso dfc bar mackellar has remained in relative obscurity in battle of britain history as he was killed in action one day after the date set by the war ministry the war as the official end date for the battle of britain he was killed on 1 november 1940 while taking on a superior number of Bf109s.93  as in the spitfire the merlin engine suffered from negative-g cut-out a problem not cured until the introduction of miss shillings orifice in early 1941.  the only battle of britain victoria cross and the only one awarded to a member of fighter command during the war,94 was awarded to flight lieutenant eric nicolson of 249 squadron as a result of an action on 16 august 1940 when his section of three hurricanes was from above by bf 110 fighters all three were hit simultaneously nicolson was badly wounded and his hurricane was damaged and engulfed in flames while attempting to leave the cockpit nicolson noticed that one of the bf 110s had overshot his aircraft he returned to the cockpit which by now was an inferno engaged the enemy and may have

siege of tobruk  the hurricane mk ii was hastily tropicalised following italys entry into the war in june 1940.100 these aircraft were initially ferried through france and malta by air to 80 squadron in egypt replacing gladiator biplanes.101 the hurricane claimed its first kill in the mediterranean on 19 june 1940, when fo pg wykeham-barnes reported shooting down two fiat CR.42s. hurricanes served with several british commonwealth squadrons in the desert air force they suffered heavy losses over north africa after the arrival of bf 109E and f-variants and were progressively replaced in the air superiority role from june 1941 by curtiss tomahawkskittyhawks however fighter-bomber variants retained an edge in the ground attack role due to their impressive armament of four 20mm cannon and a 500lb bomb load from november 1941, beginning in the libyan desert it had to face a new formidable opponent the new regia aeronautica macchi C.202 folgore the italian aircraft proved superior to the hawker fighter102 and thanks to its excellent agility and a new more powerful inline engine license-built by alfa romeo could outperform it in a dogfight.103  during and following the five-day second battle of el alamein artillery barrage that commenced on the night of 23 october 1942, six squadrons of hurricanes including the 40mm cannon-armed hurricane mkiid version claimed to have destroyed 39 tanks 212 lorries and armoured troop-carriers 26 bowsers 42 guns 200 various other vehicles and four small fuel and ammunition dumps flying 842 sorties with the loss of 11 pilots whilst performing in a ground support role hurricanes based at raf castel benito tripoli knocked out six tanks 13 armoured vehicles 10 lorries five half-tracks a gun and trailer and a wireless van on 10 march 1943, with no losses to themselves.104  in the spring of 1943, during the german ochsenkopf offensive in tunisia hurricane mkiids conducted many sorties after fog had lifted helping to blunt the final attack at hunts Gap.105  defence of maltaedit  the hurricane played a significant role in the defence of malta when italy entered the war on 10 june 1940, maltas air defence rested on gloster gladiators which managed to hold out against vastly superior numbers of the italian air force during the following 17 days to myth after the first one was lost the remaining three were named faith hope and charity in reality there were at least six gladiators four hurricanes joined them at the end of june and together they faced attacks throughout july from the 200 enemy aircraft based in sicily with the loss of one gladiator and one hurricane further reinforcements arrived on 2 august in the form of 12 more hurricanes and two blackburn Skuas.106 8  for weeks a handful of hurricane iis aided by group captain ab woodhalls masterly controlling had been meeting against all the odds the rising crescendo of field marshal kesselrings relentless attacks on grand harbour and the airfields outnumbered usually by 12 or 14 to one and later with the arrival of the bf 109Fs in sicily outperformed the pilots of the few old aircraft which the ground crews struggled valiantly to keep serviceable went on pressing their attacks ploughing their way through the german fighter screens and our flak to close in with the ju 87s and 88s as they dived for their targets  wing commander pb lucas dso D.F.C.107  the increasing number of british aircraft on the island at last prompted the italians to employ german junkers ju 87 dive bombers to try to destroy the airfields finally in an attempt to overcome the stiff resistance put up by these few aircraft the luftwaffe took up base on the sicilian airfields only to find that malta was not an easy target after numerous attacks on the island over the following months and the arrival of an extra 23 hurricanes at the end of april 1941, and a further delivery a month later the luftwaffe left sicily for the russian front in june that year.108  as malta was situated on the increasingly important sea supply route for the north african campaign the luftwaffe returned with a vengeance for a second assault on the island at the beginning of 1942. it wasnt until march when the onslaught was at its height that 15 spitfires flew in off the carrier hmseagle to join with the hurricanes already stationed there and bolster the defence but many of the new aircraft were lost on the ground and it was again the hurricane that bore the brunt of the early fighting until further reinforcements arrived.107  air defence in russiaedit  hurricane mark iib of no 81 squadron raf at murmansk-vaenga airfield russia  the hawker hurricane was the first allied lend-lease aircraft to be delivered to the soviet union with a total of 2,952 hurricanes eventually delivered,109 becoming the most numerous british aircraft in soviet service.110 many soviet pilots were disappointed by the hawker fighter regarding it as inferior to both german and russian aircraft.109111  during 1941, mk ii hurricanes played an important air defence role when the soviet union found itself under threat from the approaching german army who were advancing across a broad front stretching from leningrad and moscow to the oil fields in the south britains decision to aid the soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports and as the convoys would need to sail within range of enemy air attack from the luftwaffe based in neighbouring finland it was decided to deliver a number of hurricane mk iibs flying with nos 81 and 134 squadrons of no 151 wing raf to provide protection twenty-four were transported on the carrier argus arriving just off murmansk on 28 august 1941, and another 15 crated aircraft on board merchant vessels in addition to their convoy protection duties the aircraft also acted as escorts to russian bombers  enemy attention to the area declined in october at which point the raf pilots trained their soviet counterparts to operate the hurricanes themselves by the end of the year the rafs direct role in the region had ended but the aircraft themselves remained behind and became the first of thousands of allied aircraft that were accepted by the soviet Union.112 although soviet pilots were not universally enthusiastic about the hurricane twice hero of the soviet union lt col boris safonov the hurricane and raf hurricane mk iib fighters operating from soviet soil in defence of murmansk destroyed 15 luftwaffe aircraft for only one loss in combat.113 however in some soviet war memoirs the hurricane has been described in very unflattering terms.114  the iib hurricane as a multi-role fighter-bomber had quite a few drawbacks first of all it was 4050kmh slower than its main opponent the bf 109E interceptor at low and medium height and had a slower rate of climb the messerschmitt could outdive the hurricane because of the thicker wing profile of the british fighter but the main source of complaints was the hurricanes armament on occasion the eight or 12 small-calibre machine guns did not damage the sturdy and heavily armoured german aircraft consequently soviet ground crews started to remove the brownings retaining only four or six of the 12 machine guns two 12.7mm berezin ubs or two or even four 20mm shvak cannons were substituted but overall performance deteriorated as a result.115N 10  burma ceylon singapore and the netherlands east indiesedit  hawker hurricane mkii of 232 squadron shot down on 8 february 1942 during the battle of singapore  following the outbreak of the war with japan 51 hurricane mk iibs were disassembled and sent in crates to singapore these and the 24 pilots of whom were veterans of the battle of britain who had been transferred to the theatre formed the nucleus of five squadrons they arrived on 3 january 1942, by which time the allied fighter squadrons in singapore flying brewster buffalos had been overwhelmed during the malayan campaign the imperial japanese army air forces fighter force especially the nakajima Ki-43 oscar had been underestimated in its capability numbers and the strategy of its commanders.117118  thanks to the efforts of the 151st maintenance unit the 51 hurricanes were assembled and ready for testing within 48 hours and of these 21 were ready for operational service within three days the hurricanes were fitted with bulky dust filters under the nose and were armed with 12, rather than eight machine guns the additional weight and drag made them slow to climb and unwieldy to manoeuvre at altitude although they were more effective bomber killers.119  the recently arrived pilots were formed into 232 squadron in addition 488NZ squadron a buffalo squadron converted to hurricanes on 18 january the two squadrons formed the basis of 226 group 232 squadron became operational on 22 january and suffered the first losses and victories for the hurricane in southeast Asia.120 between 27 and 30 january another 48 hurricanes iia arrived with the aircraft carrier hmsindomitable from which they flew to airfields code-named P1 and P2, near palembang sumatra in the netherlands east indies  because of inadequate early warning systems first british radar stations became operational only towards the end of february japanese air raids were able to destroy 30 hurricanes on the ground in sumatra most of them in one raid on 7 february after japanese landings in singapore on 10 february the remnants of 232 and 488 squadrons were withdrawn to palembang however japanese paratroopers began the invasion of sumatra on 13 february hurricanes destroyed six japanese transport ships on 14 february but lost seven aircraft in the process on 18 february the remaining allied aircraft and aircrews moved to java by this time only 18 serviceable hurricanes remained out of the original 99.121  that same month 12 hurricane mk iib trops were supplied to the dutch forces on java with dust filters removed and fuel and ammo load in wings halved these were able to stay in a turn with the oscars they fought.122 after java was invaded some of the new zealand pilots were evacuated by sea to australia one aircraft which had not been assembled was transferred to the raaf becoming the only hurricane to see service in australia in training and other non-combat units  hurricane V7476, which was transferred from singapore and was the only hurricane based in australia during the second world war note the tropicalised vokes air filter which was fitted to many types operating in the pacific  when a japanese carrier task force under the command of admiral chichi nagumo made a sortie into the indian ocean in april 1942, raf hurricanes based on ceylon saw action against nagumos forces during attacks on colombo on 5 april 1942 and on trincomalee harbour on 9 april 1942.123  on 5 april 1942, captain mitsuo fuchida of the imperial japanese navy who led the attack on pearl harbor led a strike against colombo with 53 nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 38 aichi D3A dive bombers escorted by 36 mitsubishi A6M zero fighters.124 they were opposed by 35 hurricane i and iibs of 30 and 258 squadrons together with six fairey fulmars of 803 and 806 squadrons of the fleet air Arm.125 the hurricanes mainly tried to shoot down the attacking bombers but were engaged heavily by the escorting Zeros.126 a total of 21 hurricanes were shot down two of these were repairable,127 together with four Fulmars128 and six swordfish of 788 naval air squadron that had been surprised in flight by the raid.129 the raf claimed 18 japanese aircraft destroyed seven probably destroyed and nine damaged with one aircraft claimed by a fulmar and five by anti-aircraft fire this compared with actual japanese losses of one zero and six D3As, with a further seven D3As, five B5Ns and three zeros damaged.126130  on 9 april 1942, the japanese task force sent 91 B5Ns escorted by 41 zeros against trincomalee port and the nearby china bay airfield.131 a total of 16 hurricanes opposed the raid of which eight were lost with a further three damaged.132 they claimed eight japanese aircraft destroyed with a further four probably destroyed and at least five damaged actual japanese losses were three A6Ms and two B5Ns, with a further 10 B5Ns damaged.133  epilogueedit  the battles over the arakan in 1943 represented the last large-scale use of the hurricane as a pure day fighter but they were still used in the fighter-bomber role in burma until the end of the war and they were occasionally caught up in air combat as well for example on 15 february 1944, flg off jagadish chandra verma of no 6 sqdn of the royal indian air force shot down a japanese Ki-43 oscar it was the only riaf victory of the war.134 the hurricane remained in service as a fighter-bomber over the balkans and at home as well where it was used mainly for second-line tasks and occasionally flown by ace pilots for example in mid-1944, ace sqdn leader storrar flew no 1687 hurricane to deliver priority mail to allied armies in france during the normandy invasion.134  sea hurricane mk ib in formation december 1941  aircraft carrier operationsedit  main article hawker hurricane variants  the sea hurricane became operational in mid-1941 and scored its first kill while operating from hmsfurious on 31 july 1941. during the next three years fleet air arm sea hurricanes were to feature prominently while operating from royal navy aircraft carriers the sea hurricane scored an impressive kill-to-loss ratio,135N 11 primarily while defending malta convoys and operating from escort carriers in the atlantic ocean as an example on 26 may 1944, royal navy sea hurricanes operating from the escort carrier hms nairana claimed the destruction of three ju 290 reconnaissance aircraft during the defence of a convoy.136  hurricane acesedit  the top scoring hurricane pilot was squadron leader marmaduke pattle dfc bar with 35 hawker fighter victories of career 50 total with two shared serving with no 80 and 33 squadrons all of his hurricane kills were achieved over greece in 1941. he was shot down and killed in the battle of athens wing commander frank reginald carey claimed 28 air victories while flying hurricanes during 193943, and squadron leader william vale dfc and bar afc totalled 20 kills 30 in greece and syria with no 80 squadron czech pilot flt karel m kuttelwascher achieved all of his 18 air victories with the hurricane most as an intruder night fighter with no 1 squadron pilot officer vc woodward and 213 squadrons was another top-scoring ace with 14 of 18 total three of which are shared while flt richard p stevens claimed all of his 14.5 enemy aircraft flying the Hurricane.137 richard cork was the leading fleet air arm sea hurricane ace with nine destroyed two shared one probable four damaged and seven destroyed on the ground.138 czech pilot josef frantiek flying with 303 polish squadron shot down at least 17 enemy aircraft over southeast england during septemberoctober 1940. polish pilot witold urbanowicz flying with 303 polish squadron had 15 confirmed kills and one probable during the battle of britain

backbone of the fighter squadrons  hurricane mk iia series 1  hurricane mk i powered by the improved merlin xx engine with two-speed supercharger this new engine used a mix of 30 per cent glycol and 70 per cent water pure glycol is flammable so not only was the new mix safer but the engine also ran approximately 21C cooler which gave longer engine life and greater reliability.139 the new engine was longer than the earlier merlin and so the hurricane gained a 4.5 in in front of the cockpit which made the aircraft slightly more stable due to the slight forward shift in centre of gravity.140 first flew on 11 june 1940 and went into squadron service in september 1940.  hawker hurricane mk iib Z5140  hurricane mk iib iia series 2  the hurricane ii b were fitted with racks allowing them to carry two 250 lb or two 500 lb bombs this lowered the top speed of the hurricane to 301mph but by this point mixed sweeps of hurricanes carrying bombs protected by a screen of fighter hurricanes were not uncommon the same racks allowed the hurricane to carry two 45-gallon drop tanks instead of the bombs more than doubling the hurricanes fuel load.141  hurricane mk iia series 2 was equipped with new and slightly longer propeller spinner and new wing-mounting 12 x browning machine guns the first aircraft were built in october 1940 and were renamed mark iib in april 1941.  hurricane mk iib trop

the new wings also included a hardpoint for a 500 or 250lb or 110kg bomb and later in 1941, fuel tanks by then performance was inferior to the latest german fighters and the hurricane changed to the

point where the idea was abandoned  hurricane mk iv armed with RP-3 rockets  hurricane mk iv  the last major change to the hurricane was the introduction of the wing a single design able to mount two 250 or 500lb or 230kg bombs two 40mm vickers s guns drop tanks or eight pounder RP-3 rockets two brownings were fitted to aid aiming of the heavier armament.144 the new design also incorporated the improved merlin 24 or 27 engines of 1,620hp equipped with dust filters for desert operations the merlin 27 had a redesigned oil system that was better suited to operations in the tropics and which was rated at a slightly lower altitude in keeping with the hurricanes new role as a close-support fighter the radiator was deeper and armoured additional armour was also fitted around the engine.145  hurricane mk v  the final variant to be produced only three were built and the variant never reached production this was powered by a merlin 32 boosted engine to give 1,700hp at low level and was intended as a dedicated ground-attack aircraft to use in burma all three prototypes had four-bladed propellers speed was 326mph at 500ft, which is comparable with the hurricane i despite being one and a half times as heavy.145  hurricane mk x  canadian-built variant single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber powered by a 1,300hp packard merlin 28. eight 0.303in machine guns mounted in the wings in

approximately 250 aircraft they were modified to be carried by cam ships merchantman whose ships crews were merchant marine and whose hurricanes were crewed and serviced by raf personnel or fighter catapult ships which were naval auxiliary vessels crewed by naval personnel and aircraft operated by the fleet air arm these ships were equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft but without facilities to recover them consequently if the aircraft were not in range of a land base pilots had to bail out or to ditch  both of these options had their problemsthere was always a chance of striking part of the fuselage when bailing out and a number of pilots had been killed in this way ditching the hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a water brake pitching the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water while also acting as a very efficient scoop helping to flood the hurricane so that a quick exit was necessary before the aircraft sank.145 then the pilot had to be picked up by a ship more than 80 modifications were needed to convert a hurricane into a sea hurricane including new radios to conform with those used by the fleet air arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour.142 they were informally known as  the majority of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear serving with front line squadrons so much so that at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a catapult launching cam sea hurricanes were launched operationally on eight occasions and the hurricanes

carried a pair of F24 cameras with 8-inch focal length lenses the third carried one vertical and two oblique F24s with 14-inch focal length lenses mounted in the rear fuselage close to the trailing edge of the wing and a fairing was built up over the lenses aft of the radiator housing a further five hurricanes were modified in march 1941, and two were converted in a similar manner in malta during april 1941. during october 1941 a batch of six hurricane iis was converted to pr mark ii status and a final batch thought to be of 12 aircraft was converted in late 1941. the pr mark ii was said to be capable of slightly over 350mph and was able to reach 38,000ft  hurricane tac r  for duties closer to the front lines some hurricanes were converted to tactical reconnaissance r aircraft an additional radio was fitted for liaison with ground forces who were better placed to direct the hurricane some hurricane tac r aircraft also had a vertical camera fitted in the rear fuselage so to

merlin xx was designed to use  soviet pilot nikolai g golodnikov remembered hurricanes engine was powerful but it couldnt stand long periods of work at maximum regimes and would quickly break down the engine worked very clean it had exhaust stacks and flame suppressors mounted like mufflersn 9 this was very comfortable as the flames did not blind the pilot our planes were much worse in this respect but at negative g-forces the engine chocked there was no compensating tank this was very bad because we had to execute any manoeuvre with positive g-forces it had a very thick wing profile and poor acceleration characteristics it was not slow in responding to the control stick but everything happened smoothly slowly it had good lifting strength and was very good in horizontal manoeuvrability but the hurricane was very poor in vertical manoeuvre due to thick wing profile we mostly tried to impose a battle in the horizontal plane and would not go into a vertical one the hurricane burned rapidly and to cinders like a match as it had dural covering only on the tail and wings the rest was percale.116  malta the spitfire year 1942 records 28 sea hurricane victories against eight losses during
