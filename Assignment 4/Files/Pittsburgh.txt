french empire 16691758  british empire 16811781  united states 1776present  pittsburgh was named in 1758 by general john forbes in honor of british statesman william pitt 1st earl of chatham the original pronunciation would have been pits-br or pits-b-r matching similarly named places in great britain such as edinburgh in scotland and aldeburgh in Suffolk.19 pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 1771 and as a borough on april 22, 1794, with the following Act20 it enacted by the pennsylvania state senate and pennsylvania house of representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvaniaby the authority of the same that the said town of pittsburgh shall beerected into a borough which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever.21  the current pronunciation which is extremely unusual in english speaking countries is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of the city charter of march 18, 1816 not on the original document the error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the was removed in order to make it easier to spell after a public campaign the original spelling was officially restored by the united states board on geographic names in 1911.21  the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native Americans.22 the first known european to enter the region was the french explorertrader robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down the ohio River.23 european pioneers primarily dutch followed in the early 18th century michael bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the ohio in a 1717 manuscript and later that year european fur traders established area posts and settlements.24  in 1749, french soldiers from quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite canada with french louisiana via the rivers.24 during 175354, the british hastily built fort prince george before a larger french force drove them off the french built fort duquesne based on lasalles 1669 claims the french and indian war the north american front of the seven years war began with the future pittsburgh as its center british general edward braddock was dispatched with major george washington as his aide to take fort Duquesne.25 the british and colonial force were defeated at braddocks field general john forbes finally took the forks in 1758. forbes began construction on fort pitt named after william pitt the elder while the settlement was named  during pontiacs rebellion native tribes conducted a siege of fort pitt for two months until colonel henry bouquet relieved it after the battle of bushy run fort pitt is notable as the site of an early use of smallpox for biological warfare lord jeffrey amherst ordered blankets contaminated from smallpox victims to be distributed in 1763 to the tribes surrounding the fort the disease spread into other areas infected other tribes and killed hundreds of thousands.2728not in citation given  during this period the powerful nations of the iroquois confederacy based in new york had maintained control of much of the ohio valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes by the terms of the 1768 treaty of fort stanwix the penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the iroquois a 1769 survey referenced the future city as the of Pittsburgh.29 both the colony of virginia and the province of pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the masondixon line westward placing pittsburgh in pennsylvania on march 8, 1771 bedford county pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier on april 16, 1771, the citys first civilian local government was created as pitt Township.3031 william teagarden was the first constable and william troop was the first clerk.32  following the american revolution the village of pittsburgh continued to grow one of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the ohio country in 1784, thomas viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the penn family attorney pittsburgh became a possession of pennsylvania in 1785. the following year the pittsburgh post-gazette was started and in 1787, the pittsburgh academy was chartered unrest during the whiskey rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area by 1797, glass manufacture began while the population grew to around 1,400. settlers came via routes over the appalachian mountains or through the great lakes fort pitt pittsburgh at the source of the ohio river became the main base for settlers moving into the northwest territory  monongahela

production in 1875 at the edgar thomson steel works in north braddock pennsylvania which evolved into the carnegie steel company he adopted the bessemer process to increase production  in 1901, carnegie merged several companies into us steel by 1910, pittsburgh was the nations 8th-largest city accounting for between a third and a half of national steel output the citys population swelled to over a half million with european immigration via ellis island in new york harbor by 1940, non-hispanic whites were 90.6 of the citys population.33 pittsburgh also became a main destination of the african-american great migration from the rural south during the first half of the 20th century.34 limited initially by discrimination some 95 percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.35

almost century of industry the citys reputation as the of democracy3637 was being overshadowed by james partons 1868 observation of pittsburgh being with the lid off.38  following the war the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the cleaning up the air and the rivers the ii project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development the industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the areas steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring there were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.10  president barack obama visiting carnegie mellon universitys national robotics engineering center in 2011  in the later 20th century the area shifted its economic base to education tourism and services largely based on healthcaremedicine finance and high technology such as robotics although pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable the citys population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs while 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population even as the metropolitan area population increased again  during the late 2000s recession pittsburgh was economically strong adding jobs when most cities were losing them

over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more  guillermo cole  in a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the united states the american lung association ranked only six us metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution and only seven us metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than pittsburgh for ozone pollution pittsburgh was ranked 24th among us metro areas.6667 the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey the alas rankings have been disputed by the allegheny county health department since data from only the worst of the regions 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ala without any context or averaging the lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to us steels clairton coke works the nations largest coke mill and several municipalities outside the citys jurisdiction of pollution controls leading to possible confusion that pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.68 the regions readings also reflect pollution swept in from ohio and west virginia though both are outside the jurisdictional powers of local leadership.69  although the county was still below the threshold the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.70 achd spokesman guillermo cole stated that the best its been in the
