rocket launch  play media  video of the launch of space shuttle endeavour on STS-134  a rocket launch is the takeoff phase of the flight of a rocket launches for orbital spaceflights or launches into interplanetary space are usually from a fixed location on the ground but may also be from a floating platform or from an airplane  launches of suborbital flights missile launches can also be from  a missile silo  a mobile launcher vehicle  a submarine  air launch  from a plane scaled composites spaceshipone pegasus rocket X-15  from a balloon da vinci project development  a surface ship ballistic missile defense system or ocean based platform launch  an inclined rail rocket sled launch  launches not into space can also be from  the shoulder  a skyrocket is launched from some stand  launch technologies generally refers to the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle not just the vehicle itself but also the firing control systems ground control station launch pad and tracking stations needed for a successful launch andor recovery  contents  1 commercial launches  2 launch vehicles  3 orbital launches  4 see also  5 references  6 external links  commercial launchesedit  launch of arianespace soyuz a three stage expendable launch system surrounded by water vapor from sublimating ice  see also launch service provider  commercial launch service providers include  antrix corporation  arianespace 5Soyuz-2Vega  china aerospace science and technology corporation march  eurockot launch services  international launch services  isc kosmotras  land launch  mitsubishi heavy industries  orbital atk  sea launch  spacex 9Falcon heavy  starsem  united launch alliance vdelta iidelta iv  launch vehiclesedit  main article launch vehicle  if a rocket is launched to deliver a payload from a planetary surface into space it is called a launch vehicle  there are several broad categories that launch vehicles fall under including  expendable launch system  reusable launch system  single stage to orbit  two stage to orbit  three stage to orbit  for the launch vehicles currently in use for human spaceflight see that article there were over 70 orbital launches in 2010.  orbital launchesedit  isro pslv C20 saral mission dogleg maneuver  orbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically and then begin to progressively lean over usually following a gravity turn trajectory  once above the majority of the atmosphere the vehicle then angles the rocket jet pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed as the speed grows the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed the engine will cut off  all current vehicles stage that is jettison hardware on the way to orbit although vehicles have been proposed which would be able to reach orbit without staging none have ever been constructed and the exponentially increasing fuel requirements of such a vehicle would make its useful payload tiny or nonexistent most current and historical launch vehicles their jettisoned hardware typically by allowing it to crash into the ocean but some have recovered and reused jettisoned hardware either by parachute or by propulsive landing  when launching a spacecraft to orbit a is a guided powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rockets flight path to deviate from a path a dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth to reach a desired orbital inclination would take the ground track over land over a populated area eg russia usually does launch over land but over unpopulated areas or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the latitude of the launch site doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required causing heavier load and a reduction of vehicle performance  see alsoedit  launch mechanisms  gravity drag  non-rocket spacelaunch  list of rockets  orbital spaceflight  sub-orbital spaceflight  spaceport  list of rocket launch sites  launch status check  referencesedit  external linksedit  calendar of current and upcoming launches  scheduled and past launches in principle all from 1999  v  t  e  types of takeoff and landing  takeoff  assisted take-off  balanced field takeoff  jato  non-rocket spacelaunch  rejected takeoff  rocket launch  zero-length launch  takeoff and landing  catobar  ctol  stobar  stol  stovl  vstol  vthlvtohl  vtol  launch and recovery cycle  vtvl  vthl  hthl  htvl  landing  belly landing  crosswind landing  deadstick landing  emergency landing  forced landing  hard landing  srvl  short-field landing  soft landing  splashdown  touch-and-go landing  water landing ditching  floating landing platform  retrieved from  categories space launch vehiclesrocketryflight phaseshidden categories articles containing video clips
