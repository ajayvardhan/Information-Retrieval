38typhoon names have been retired since the start of official tropical cyclone naming in the western north pacific ocean in 2000. tropical cyclone names are retired by the world meteorological organization in a meeting in january or february those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms several names were removed or altered naming list for various reasons other than retirement collectively retired typhoons have caused over in damage as well as over 12,000deaths.  contents  1 background  2 20th century  3 2000s  4 2010s  5 see also  6 notes  7

haiyan  the practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries with systems named after places saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in the western Pacific.1 these included the kamikaze 1906 hong kong typhoon 1922 swatow typhoon and the 1934 muroto typhoon.2  the practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the united states weather bureau in the northern atlantic basin after hurricanes carol edna and hazel struck the east coast of the united states and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.3 initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced however it was decided at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.34 the first tropical cyclone name to be removed in the south pacific was rosie after it had impacted vanuatu and new caledonia during 1971. several names have been removed from the pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of deathdestruction which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and political reasons.56  in 2000, the japan meteorological agency began naming tropical cyclones from a list of 140names, submitted by 14countries. previously the jma labeled storms with numbers but not names the jma has been the official warning agency of the western pacific ocean since 1981, though other organizations have also tracked typhoons the joint typhoon warning center unofficially named tropical cyclones from 1947 to 1999.7 during this time period there were several pre-determined tropical cyclone lists in which many names were removed and replaced with others.8 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration names tropical cyclones using a separate list which is adjusted periodically.9  several names were removed from the list in 2002, the name hanuman was replaced prior to being used due to objection by the india meteorological department for reason of religion.10 additionally the name kodo was replaced in 2002 without being used.11 the following year koni was replaced by goni after an apparent misspelling was made in 2004, the names yanyan and tingting were removed at the request of the hong kong Observatory.1112 a total of nine names on the list had their spellings changed.11 in february 2014, the name sonamu was removed at the request from malaysia due to causing unprecedented panic by the similar pronunciation to tsunami.13 in february 2015 the name jongdari was chosen as replacement for sonamu in the 46th session of the typhoon committee it was noted the name vicente appears on both the tropical cyclone name lists for the western north pacific and eastern north pacific in response to this duplication the name lan was chosen as replacement for vicente on the western north pacific name list to avoid potential confusion  20th centuryedit  typhoon mireille near peak intensity on september 22, 1991  between 1947 and 2000, eleven names of significant tropical cyclones were retired from the list of names used by the united states joint typhoon warning Center.14 during this time other names were removed from the naming lists including in 1979 when the lists of names used were revised to include both male and female names.1415 tropical storm lucille was the first name to be retired for its impacts while ophelia was retired because of its long 8,045km track.14  name  dates active
