tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 17. it moved across the shear-ridden atlantic ocean without development and remained disorganized until reaching the western caribbean sea on september 26. there the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop on the september 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the yucatn peninsula the system continued to organize and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the yucatn peninsula on september 29.2  dry air and land weakened the tropical wave and when it entered the area of the bay of campeche it merged with a stationary frontal boundary cool dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core and the area organized into an extratropical low on september 30. a large high pressure system over the northern gulf of mexico forced the system southward where it developed significant convection the system developed a warm core and on october 1 the storm organized into tropical storm larry while located 300mi east-southeast of tampico Mexico.2  weak steering currents allowed for larry to drift westward at about twomph while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to a peak of 65mph on october 3. a mid-level ridge forced the storm more to the south-southeast where after remaining a 60mph storm for three days larry made landfall on paraso in the mexican state of tabasco on october 5. it steadily weakened over land and degenerated into a remnant low on october 6 while midway through the isthmus of tehuantepec the remnant low turned to the southwest and reached the eastern pacific ocean on the october 7.2 the remnants of larry re-organized in the eastern pacific with the national hurricane center indicating for the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on october 9.3 however the convection diminished and further development was no longer anticipated.4  preparationsedit  tropical storm larry approaching tabasco on october 4  due to its erratic motion the mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch early in larrys lifetime from veracruz to campeche the watches and warnings were extended westward to tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to ciudad del carmen on october 5.2 due to the threat of the storm officials closed three pemex oil ports.5 the company used its reserves to make sure profits werent disrupted.6 in addition the storm

surge of 3 to 5feet to 1.5m, with high waves on top,9 though no official surge readings were reported.2 the highest recorded winds on land were 59mph in el alacrn in tabasco the worst of larrys effects came from its rainfall peaking at 24.77inches in upper juarez in southeastern Mexico.10 the highest 24-hour rainfall total was 9.6inches in tortuguero Chiapas,8 while several other locations
