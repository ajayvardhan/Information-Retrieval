and strongest of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season the thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane that year michelle developed from a tropical wave that had traversed into the western caribbean sea on October29 the wave had initially moved off the coast of africa 13days prior in its early developmental stages the depression meandered over nicaragua later paralleling the mosquito coast before intensifying into tropical storm intensity on November1 michelle was upgraded to hurricane strength the following day shortly after rapid intensification ensued within favorable conditions with the storms central barometric pressure dropping 51mbar 1.51inHg in 29hours. after a slight fluctuation in strength michelle reached its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph and a minimum pressure of 933mbar 27.55inHg.nb 1 at roughly the same time the hurricane began to accelerate northeastward this brought the intense hurricane to a cuban landfall within the bay of pigs later that day crossing over the island michelle was weakened significantly and was only a Category1 hurricane upon reentry into the atlantic ocean the hurricane later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the bahamas on November5, before being absorbed by a cold front the following day  hurricane michelle caused widespread devastation across the western caribbean during its eight-day trek as a tropical wave torrential rainfall occurred across jamaica causing mudslides and killing two people damage in the island country was estimated at 2 when the storm drifted over areas of central america early in its existence heavy rains isolated numerous villages and damaged infrastructure affecting areas affected by hurricane mitch roughly three years prior in honduras and nicaragua 14people were killed with an additional 62people unaccounted for in the cayman islands areas were affected by strong storm surge and flooding particularly in grand cayman where damage was totaled  the majority of damage caused by michelle occurred in cuba where the storm was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island in over 49years. strong storm surge and heavy rainfall disrupted communication networks across the country high winds and rain also destroyed buildings and damaged the sugar cane crop at the time michelle was the costliest hurricane in cuban history with an estimated in damage this figure was greatly surpassed by hurricane ike nearly seven years later as a weakening system michelle moved past florida and the bahamas strong waves caused severe beach erosion and winds damaged property throughout the entirety of michelles track 22people were killed and damage was estimated at roughly usd 2017USD. after the season the name michelle was retired and

storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on October16, 2001, a tropical wave moved westward off the coast of africa and moved into the atlantic ocean at the time the wave produced minimal convective and thunderstorm activity on October23, the disturbance crossed the lesser antilles before moving into the caribbean sea while showing minimal signs of tropical development three days later the wave moved into the western caribbean spawning a broad low-pressure area off the coast of nicaragua at 1800UTC on October29,1 a reconnaissance flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression 40mi south-southwest of puerto cabezas Nicaragua.2 at the time convection was displaced primarily to the north of the center of circulation and the storm was situated in a weak steering pattern as such initial forecasts predicted for the depression designated as tropical depression fifteen to slowly move generally northward.3 later that day a burst of convection occurred over the circulation center of the depression indicating an increase in organization.4 the disturbance meandered over eastern nicaragua for 36hours before emerging into the caribbean sea near cabo gracias a dios by 2100UTC on October31.15 upon emerging into the caribbean sea the depression quickly organized and the national hurricane centernhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm strength at 0000UTC the following day based on information from a reconnaissance flight prior as such the tropical storm was designated with the name Michelle.67  gradual strengthening occurred throughout November1, as michelles cloud tops began to cool as it drifted northward signifying strengthening at the time the nhc predicted that there was a roughly 12percent chance for the tropical storm to rapidly intensify by that time the storm had met three of the organizations five criterion for rapid intensification.8 during the day fluctuations in convective activity occurred and there were some signs of wind shear affecting the cyclone but there was a general strengthening trend.9 two dropsondes deployed within the system early on November2 observed hurricane-force winds within michelle based on this data the nhc upgraded michelle to hurricane intensity at 1200UTC that day,7 while the storm was situated 290mi south-southeast of the guanahacabibes Peninsula.10  hurricane michelle undergoing extratropical transition over the bahamas on November5  a period of rapid intensification began shortly after as michelles satellite presentation improved with the cyclones minimum barometric pressure falling 51mbar 1.51inHg in 29hours.1 at 0000UTC on November3, the hurricane attained Category2 hurricane intensity at roughly the same time the hurricanes eye became more apparent on satellite imagery.11 by 1200UTC later that day michelle had intensified to a Category4 hurricane.7 six hours later the hurricane weakened to Category3 intensity but reached its minimum barometric pressure of 934mbar 27.58inHg. afterwards michelles central pressure began to rise despite the trend its maximum sustained winds also strengthened as it curved northeastward.7 despite having its convective organization disrupted and its eye no longer as apparent on November4,12 michelle attained winds of 140mph by 0600UTC that day these would be the highest sustained winds estimated for the system throughout its existence.7  at 1800UTC on November4, michelle made landfall on cayo largo del sur as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph this was followed shortly after with a landfall on the bay of pigs five hours later as a slightly weaker storm when michelle made landfall on the cuban mainland it was the strongest landfalling hurricane in cuban history since the landfall of hurricane fox in 1952. at the time the hurricanes minimum barometric pressure was 950mbar 28.06inHg. over cuba michelles center of circulation was significantly disrupted and as a result the hurricane decreased in intensity1 by the time it had emerged into the atlantic ocean on November5, winds were only estimated at 90mph southwesterly wind shear further inhibited any additional tropical development and as such michelle began to transition into an extratropical cyclone.13 that day the weakening hurricane made landfalls over andros island and eleuthera island before becoming fully extratropical by 0000UTC on November6, while still maintaining hurricane-force winds the extratropical system persisted for roughly 18more hours before it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.1  preparationsedit  cubaedit  warnings and watches associated with hurricane michelle as it made landfall on cuba on November4  as hurricane michelle approached the cuban coast the government of cuba issued a hurricane watch for the western cuban provinces of pinar del ro la habana matanzas and isla de la juventud at 2100UTC on November1.14 the following day the same hurricane watch was extended eastward to include all provinces from pinar del ro to ciego de vila115 all hurricane watches in cuba were upgraded to hurricane warnings at 1100UTC on November3.16 all warnings in cuba were discontinued once michelle began to accelerate out to sea at 1200UTC on November5.1  prior to reaching the coast michelle was expected to be the strongest cuban tropical cyclone in at least 75years. the cuban red cross deployed 24,500volunteers across cuba to assist civil defense teams in evacuation procedures for potentially affected populations by November4, an estimated 590,000people were evacuated across the country including 80percent of the population of the province of pinar del Ro.17 in havana authorities evacuated 150,000people. coastal tourist resorts were cleared and 35,500students were evacuated out of camps hosted on the zapata Peninsula.18 on cubas southwestern islands including cayo largo and isla de la juventud 500tourists were evacuated the entire population of surgidero de bataban was evacuated.19 in addition to the evacuations the government sent food water and medicine supplies to areas south of the capital all domestic and international flights to and from the country were cancelled.18  elsewhereedit  at 1700UTC on November1, a tropical storm watch was issued for grand cayman Island.115 three hours prior the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning in conjunction with a hurricane watch for areas of the florida keys from ocean reef florida to the dry Tortugas.16 at 0300UTC on November4, a hurricane watch was issued for areas of the northwestern and central bahamas at the same time a new tropical storm warning was issued for the east coast of florida between jupiter inlet and ocean reef and for the states western coast south of bonita beach at 0600UTC, the tropical storm watch for grand cayman was upgraded and extended to include the entirety of the cayman islands six hours later the hurricane watch for the florida keys was upgraded to warning status early the next day a hurricane watch was issued for bermuda after michelle made its final cuban landfall meanwhile the tropical storm warning issued for the cayman islands was discontinued as michelle accelerated away from landmasses warnings and watches were discontinued all tropical cyclone warnings in the united states were discontinued by 2100UTC that day at the same time however the hurricane watch for bermuda was changed to a tropical storm warning this warning was sustained for a day before being discontinued shortly after all warnings in the bahamas were also discontinued.1  impactedit  deaths and damage by region  region  total  deaths  missing  damage   source  bahamas  0  0  7008300000000000000300million  cayman islands  0  0

extensive damage in central america and cuba  jamaicaedit  as the precursor tropical wave to michelle drifted through the western caribbean sea it produced torrential rainfall on the island of jamaica causing widespread flooding.1 several residences on annotto bay and port maria were flooded as a result 163evacuees sought shelter in locations in annotto bay in portland a shelter was opened for effected populations21 in the same parish six homes were swept away from their foundations.22 in the parishes of saint catherine saint andrew and saint ann several roads were blocked by debris the jamaican national works agencynwa worked to clear the road debris.21 the blocked roads isolated seven jamaican villages for an extended period of time.23  after tropical cyclogenesis michelle passed to the northwest of jamaica producing additional rainfall in a 48-hour period beginning on October29, a location measured 41.65 inches denoting an average rainfall rate of 0.86 inches per hour.24 many other locations reported high rainfall totals over a ten-day period throughout michelles passage near Jamaica.1 near spur tree hill an oil spill resulted from the flooding roads that were previously cleaned of debris a few days prior were covered again by the additional rainfall the rains also disrupted the countrys communication and electrical grid leaving 6,000homes without power in affected regions the widespread power outages in conjunction with invasive floodwaters also caused the cessation of 31water plants run by the national water commission overall 30homes were destroyed by flooding caused by michelle as it passed to the northwest extensive damage was reported to small livestock bananas plantains vegetables and coffee.25 coffee crops were severely affected in portland and saint andrew parishes with losses calculated at J102.6million roughly 400ac of banana plantations were damaged over four parishes amounting to J18.2million in damage the plantain crop mostly grown for domestic usage suffered extensive damage valued at J22million losses sustained to livestock were estimated at J30.8million  overall floods caused widespread damage throughout jamaica the watersheds of the spanish and swift rivers were the worst affected areas near the coast the rivers began to overflow due to excess floodwater eroding beach roads and three major highways in portland parish the rains caused numerous landslides in the community of bybrook alone it was estimated that roughly 7,000,000ft3 of material was deposited in the village an assessment of the damage concluded that 500homes were destroyed beyond repair while an additional 561homes were at least damaged by the floods and heavy rain while one school was damaged solely by the floods six other schools were damaged due to their use as shelters.26 damage on jamaica due to michelle totaled of which was due to crop and livestock losses damage to bridges alone totaled J143.7million five fatalities were also confirmed,26 and 340people were displaced from their homes.27  central americaedit  tropical depression fifteen affecting central america on October30  in its early developmental stages as a tropical depression michelle drifted over areas of central america for roughly 36hours, dropping torrential rainfall and causing widespread flooding in areas affected by hurricane mitch almost exactly three years prior the hardest hit region was gracias a dios department in northeastern honduras where at one point 100villages were isolated by the floods the torrential rainfall caused the displacement of at least 100,000people from their residences.1 across central america over 27,300people were evacuated from flooded areas.28  in honduras the floods damaged 245homes, resulting in the displacement of 4,393people across the country six bridges sustained at least partial damage of which three were destroyed as a result of the damage the government of honduras declared a state of emergency for five departments coln atlntida yoro corts and santa Brbara.29 the floods caused by michelle were further exacerbated by a cold front which lingered over the region dropping additional rainfall.28 of the affected departments yoro was the most affected with no supply of drinkable water and electricity following the flooding.30 near yoro a bridge crossing the cuyamapa river collapsed due to the floodwaters.31 despite the heavy rainfall areas of honduras suffering from a prolonged drought did not receive beneficial rainfall.32 overall the floods in honduras killed 21people and caused in damage.33 thirty-five of the countrys water systems were destroyed the rains also caused the loss of 70percent of bean crops.34  although the precursor to michelle remained stationary primarily over nicaragua damage was not as significant as in honduras due to the storms displacement of convection to the north.1 nonetheless floods still isolated villages and other communities in the nicaraguan districts of bonaza rosita siuna puerto cabezas waspam and to a lesser extent prinzapolka in those areas roads and bridges were damaged and in some cases destroyed the heavy rains also damaged crops.30 due to the rains an estimated 6,000people evacuated from their homes the port city of puerto cabezas was partially flooded.35 as a result of michelle a total of 16deaths were confirmed and damage in the country was estimated at in costa rica michelle caused anomalously high rainfall resulting in flooding.36 overall damage in costa rica totaled though no deaths were reported.33  cayman islandsedit  in early november hurricane michelle brought heavy surf storm surge and flooding to the cayman islands of the islands in the archipelago grand cayman experienced the worst effects from michelle particularly along the islands west coast rainfall peaked at 6.52in in grand cayman the same station recorded a peak wind gust of 44mph the rains caused localized flooding in the western and southern portions of the island.37 another weather station in cayman brac observed a peak wind gust of 40mph overall damage from the cayman islands totaled  costliest cuban hurricanes  hurricane

from hurricane michelle the shipments are part of a one-time purchase of us food by the cuban government to assist in the countrys present food shortage.61  the cuban government refused an initial us offer of humanitarian assistance but accepted a proposal to purchase the goods instead although the united states has maintained an economic embargo on cuba for decades us law does allow shipments of food and medicine to the communist-controlled island but until now the cuban government has refused to buy american food because of the restrictions including a ban on direct us financing of food sales.61  other aid from the international community is helping cuba survive michelles aftermath cuba was promised in aid from chinese leader li peng who was visiting when the hurricane struck
