enthalpy of vaporization  from heat of condensation  temperature-dependency of the heats of vaporization for water methanol benzene and acetone  the enthalpy of vaporization hvap also known as the heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation is the amount of energy that must be added to the liquid substance to transform a quantity of that substance into a gas the enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the pressure at which that transformation takes place  the enthalpy of vaporization is often quoted for the normal boiling temperature of the substance although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298K, that correction is often smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value  the heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperature the heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature above the critical temperature the liquid and vapor phases are indistinguishable and the substance is called a supercritical fluid  contents  1 units  2 enthalpy of condensation  3

in jmol or kjmol enthalpy of vaporization although kjkg or jg heat of vaporization and older units like kcalmol calg and btulb are sometimes still used among others  enthalpy of condensationedit  the enthalpy of condensation heat of condensation is by definition equal to the enthalpy of vaporization with the opposite sign enthalpy changes of vaporization are always positive is absorbed by the substance whereas enthalpy changes of condensation are always negative is released by the substance  thermodynamic backgroundedit  the enthalpy of vaporization can be written as  it is equal to the increased internal energy of the vapor phase compared with the liquid phase plus the work done against ambient pressure the increase in the internal energy can be viewed as the energy required to overcome the intermolecular interactions in the liquid solid in the case of sublimation hence helium has a particularly low enthalpy of vaporization 0.0845kJmol, as the van der waals forces between helium atoms are particularly weak on the other hand the molecules in liquid water are held together by relatively strong hydrogen bonds and its enthalpy of vaporization 40.65kJmol, is more than five times the energy required to heat the same quantity of water from 0C to 100C 75.3JK1mol1. care must be taken however when using enthalpies of vaporization to measure the strength of intermolecular forces as these forces may persist to an extent in the gas phase is the case with hydrogen fluoride and so the calculated value of the bond strength will be too low this is particularly true of metals which often form covalently bonded molecules in the gas phase in these cases the enthalpy of atomization must be used to obtain a true value of the bond energy  an alternative description is to view the enthalpy of condensation as the heat which must be released to the surroundings to compensate for the drop in entropy when a gas condenses to a liquid as the liquid and gas are in equilibrium at the boiling point vG0, which leads to  as neither entropy nor enthalpy vary greatly with temperature it is normal to use the tabulated standard values without any correction for the difference in temperature from 298K. a correction must be made if the pressure is different from 100kPa, as the entropy of a gas is proportional to its pressure more precisely to its fugacity the entropies of liquids vary little with pressure as the compressibility of a liquid is small  these two definitions are equivalent the boiling point is the temperature at which the increased entropy of the gas phase overcomes the intermolecular forces as a given quantity of matter always has a higher entropy in the gas phase than in a condensed phase is always positive and from   the gibbs free energy change falls with increasing temperature gases are favored at higher temperatures as is observed in practice  vaporization enthalpy of electrolyte solutionsedit  estimation of the enthalpy of vaporization of electrolyte solutions can be simply carried out using equations based on the chemical thermodynamic models such as pitzer model1 or tcpc model.2  selected valuesedit  elementsedit  v  t  e  enthalpies
