low-pressure system classified as a tropical low by the australian bureau of Meteorology,1 moved west-southwest across the 90th meridian east into the southwest indian ocean basin on august 8.2 at 1000 utc the following day mto-france runion upgraded the low-pressure system to a zone of disturbed weather with sustained winds of up to 55 kmh mph being detected on the southern side of the circulation by scatterometer.3 at this time the disturbance was located approximately 2,375 km mi west of jakarta Indonesia.3 mto-france noted that the revival of convective activity in the basin was likely due to the interaction between an eastwards-moving kelvin wave and a westwards-moving rossby wave.3  storm namesedit  within the south-west indian ocean tropical depressions and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 65kmh by the regional specialized meteorological center on la runion island france la runion are usually assigned a name however it is the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory centers in mauritius and madagascar who name the systems the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory center in mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55E and 90E. if instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between 30E and 55E then the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory center in madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm beginning from the 201617 season name lists within the south-west indian ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis storm names are only used once so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 202021 season the unused names are expected to be reused in the list for the 202021 season.4
