ramen produced by john feldmann and butch walker the album was recorded as a duo by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist brendon urie and drummer spencer smith following the departure of lead guitarist backing vocalist and primary lyricist ryan ross and bassistbacking vocalist jon walker in july 2009. the albums artwork was conceptualized by touring bassist dallon weekes who was inducted as a full-time member of the band near the end of recording.2  while walker and ross exit left a hole in the panic songwriting regime the experience became the catalyst for urie finding his own voice and the confidence to take over as the bands principal songsmith the lyrics touch on themes of manipulation and confusion vices virtues took over two years to create and the increased time in the studio brought forth new musical experimentation  upon release the album received generally mixed to positive reviews critics praised the albums wide variety of musical stylings while citing compositional simplicity and uries verbose lyricism as detractors preceded by lead single ballad of mona lisa the album debuted at number seven on the billboard 200 selling 56,000 copies within its first week

release history  13 references  14 external links  backgroundedit  material for a follow-up to pretty odd dates back to at least april 2008, just one month after the release of the record former guitarist and primary songwriter ryan ross told nme the band had or ten new songs going right now which picked up in the same direction of pretty Odd.3 was pretty much the same with the last record bassist jon walker said havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about its sounding awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record ross joked.4 got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year.4 the article explained that walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music.4 in june 2009, singer brendon urie revealed the band had been writing for half a year now at ross topanga canyon california home and continued to take the band down the sun-dappled retro-pop path began exploring on pretty odd always been a pop band weve always been fans of pop music whether its the beatles which is like the beginning of pop music weve always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music spencer smith drummer added moved to california since the last record so thats inspiration we started surfing too so maybe well get a little beach boys vibe on this one.5 during this time smith moved in with urie while ross began writing his own material with walker at his home.6  on july 6, 2009, ryan ross and jon walker announced via the bands official website that the two were leaving the band.78 the statement in part read ross and jon walker will be leaving panic at the disco to embark on a musical excursion of their own though the four of us have made music together in the past weve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve over the years we have remained close and honest with each other which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us.8 in an interview following the split ross explained that he first brought the idea to smith in late june 2009 over lunch and i had lunch and caught up for a while and then the big question came up like what do you want to do and i said i think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while and he said glad you said that because i was going to say the same thing ross recalled there was really no argument which is really the best way that couldve worked out ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and urie urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound while ross and by extension walker was interested in making retro-inspired rock.9  the news asserted that both tour plans with Blink-182 in august 2009 and new album production continue as previously announced,7 and the announcement ended with the teaser for a soon to come.8 the following day alternative press broke the news that perspective the first song recorded without ross and walker debuted the following month on radio and as a part of the soundtrack to the film jennifers Body.10 perspective was recorded in spring 2009, when the band had just moved out to topanga smith explained the song was inspired by the bands new experiences when there living near the ocean and going surfing every day which weve never done before we tried to get that out in the song i guess.11 the band reinserted the exclamation mark into its name a few days after the departure of ross and Walker.12  recording and productionedit  the writing and recording process for vices virtues took much longer than the band intended the band was confused after the split from ross and walker desiring instead to go on tour to understand better.13 as evidenced above glory and perspective were largely recorded during the summer of 2009 with producer john Feldmann.6 songs are just brendon and i having fun because thats what we want to do smith told mtv News.6 shortly after the departure of ross and walker smith revealed the band was recording working on an album now that hopefully takes the best parts from both of our records because we love them both and are really proud of them.14 while on the Blink-182 reunion tour smith showed Blink-182 singerbassist mark hoppus several demos for the album in hopes that he would produce a song or two.6 hoppus confirmed in august 2009 that he was committed to producing one strong track on the record as well as possible others if allowed.15 during this time urie told news outlets the band had 10 songs ready to consider for the bands third album.16 in the beginning stages a song featuring rivers cuomo of weezer whom urie later described as nice was set to appear on the new album but the song is absent from the final track listing.17 the band initially planned to record the album in fall 2009, to be released the beginning of 2010.16  however recording did not begin until april 2010. friend and pretty odd producer rob mathes was family to smith and urie inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duos initial beginning he encouraged them to love the work they do and just get out of bed in the morning dont loathe the things that you actually love doing because its just going to keep you down for which urie recalled the band a lot for.13 after working with the demos produced during the summer with feldmann for several months afterward the duo decided they werent satisfactory so the band started over with new material the biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band with urie and smith writing everything.13 the album was produced by feldmann and butch Walker.18 urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers but instead regarded feldmann and walkers input positively regarding their help as this is your record i want to help you with your ideas so you bring me the ideas and well help you do that i dont want to write anything for you this is your record it has to be your voice the band continued working with feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to walker to finalize and improve the songs.13  on may 7, 2010, the band posted a batch of photos during recording sessions for vices Virtues.19 all guitars and bass for the album were completed by early July,20 and by the end of the month urie confirmed that recording of the album was complete and mixing would follow soon.21 near the end of the writing process the band looked back upon the lyrics and noticed that of the motion was pining for something or some of it was vanity or some of it touched on subversion or overthrowing of somebody or manipulation urie likened it to the seven deadly sins and after research settled on the title vices virtues the biblical sense theres all that stuff and then theres just morals that we live by every day and human behavior urie said guess this record was really a study in human behaviormostly for us personally what we had been going through and noticing all of that.13  musicedit  the duo performing on the first show of the vices virtues tour in new york city february 1, 2011.  musically vices virtues has been described as alternative rock,22 pop rock,232425 pop punk,232627 emo pop,2829 baroque pop3031 and synth-pop.32  the album features a variety of different musical styles in its tracks as a testament to the amount of time of production each song different from the next according to urie in the beginning the band had no direction for music or lyrics however after returning to the studio and restarting production the band became excited to start with a second chance been working on music for about a year and a half so i think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles smith said of it was us at the beginning trying to figure out what we wanted to do we had a new opportunity with just the two of us and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was just kind of went from there.33 the duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was get all the work done record the song arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadnt used before.13 the bands musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an ipad to record synthesizers on the record the band got to work with french band the plastiscines and a childrens choir on the track witches since we Met...34  a majority of the bands previous material was written by former guitarist ryan ross for vices virtues urie had step up and take the reins lyrically which he regarded as having not much experience in prior the biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out instead of locking themselves in and writing urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling urie explained were so self-conscious about everything hyper-aware of what were doing that when were writing i go i dont want this to be barry manilows but i want it to be as romantic and cute theres a lot of that fighting within yourself but it ended up being great and im glad that we were able to figure out what we wanted to write about the lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of ross and Walker.13 the sessions with feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds really loved paul simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments explains urie ended up buying some synths and messing around with them it was two kids in a candy store and we listened to arcade fires the suburbs on repeat for me for the past well since it came out  ballad of mona lisa has been described by alternative press as the upbeat pop energy of a fever you cant sweat out with the focus and clarity of pretty odd urie has explained that he and smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former missed a couple things from our first record in terms of sonically with these little instruments that we hadnt really used on our second record there a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers so we wanted to get back to some of that.13 smith agreed and stated think theres stuff from the first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy.33 calendar originally written about an intimate relationship between a male and a female soon began to resemble the friendships in former members ross and walker the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group smiles was written for uries wife smiles is about my girlfriend actually as sappy as that is he told spin in 2011. i met her i wrote this song to try and impress her i was infatuated with her i played it for her and weve been dating ever since that was a huge step for me personally.17 witches since we met was rejected for inclusion on pretty odd due it not fitting within the concept of the album urie and smith finished the song for vices Virtues.35  promotionedit  the albums title and other early information was announced in alternative press in its december 2010 issue it set the album for a march 2011 release the first single tentatively titled lisa due out in january 2011.36 the band did a promotional vices virtues photoshoot with designer anthony franco on the january 8, 2011.37 on january 18, the band revealed via a post on their website that the record

released via the bands official website in july 2009 as a 30-second sample.43 like pretty odd vices virtues received heavy popularity through online music stores by february 2011, the record was already up to the top five overall on the albums chart.40 promotion for vices virtues included an appearance on conan a week after the records release on march 28, and lopez tonight a week after that on april 4, 2011.40  in promotion of the record smith and urie filmed a short film to accompany the album titled the overture directed by shane drake the film was released on march 9, 2011 and contains several musical snippets from the record.44 the nearly seven-minute mini-film features urie and smith with a score of actors ranging from identical twins to a little people couple.45 the film is filled with symbolism regarding the departure of ross and walker and the process of moving on without them.44  in march 2011, the band began streaming the album in its entirety the exception of bonus tracks from the official panic at the disco facebook page along with an accompanying introductory video from urie and Smith.46  releaseedit  vices virtues was released march 18, 2011 in the

stone   spin  61061  usa today   vices virtues has received mixed to positive reviews at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the album has received an average score of 62 out of 100, which indicates favourable reviews based on 15 reviews.52 jarett wieselman of the new york post called the record of 2011s best and most captivating albums calling smiles the and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track kill Tonight.63 alternative press also welcomed the new version of panic at the disco smith and uries biggest success on vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008s pretty odd wrote critic evan lucy duo sound absolutely recharged likely a result of the lineup shuffling but also perhaps a realization that the were a nice place to visit for a couple years but life in the 21st century is much more fun.54 he went on to praise the string arrangements creepy undertones and twinkling pianos on several tracks and enjoy the more personal tracks such as calendar and james montgomery of mtv news said of the album is at its very core a studio album one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation which not only positions panic as perhaps this generations brian-wilsons-on-a-budget but serves as a solid starting point for wherever urie and smith choose to go from here he complimented the new sound of the band not exactly new not exactly old but its definitely something call it a fresh start a return to form a re-imaging of the past just dont call it pretty odd because that ship has sailed panic are back to their old tricks exclamation point and all and perhaps that was the secret ingredient all along.64  negative criticism for the album mostly came regarding the inexperienced lyrcism of urie william goodman of spin criticized uries lyrics of the album result is verbose and generic diary-entry romance but praised the musical experimentation remarking virtuess saving grace though is the varied instrumentation marimbas xylophones accordion synths and digital atmospherics.61 jody rosen of rolling stone concurred with goodman and also focused positive opinion upon the arrangements of the album recommending witches and calling the album retropop commenting the closest emo has come to the sound of old-school pop and rock with beach boys harmonies and even gypsy-style swing flavoring the usual hopped-up confessions.60 mikael wood of entertainment weekly agreed with these sentiments recommending ballad of mona-lisa and the Smiles.56  vices virtues touredit  main article vices virtues tour  in support of the record panic at the disco announced multiple tours dubbed thus far as intimate evening with panic at the disco the short north american tour ran from january 23 to april 4, 2011. a full-fledged european tour took place
