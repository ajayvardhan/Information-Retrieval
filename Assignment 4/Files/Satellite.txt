artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earths moon  in 1957 the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1. since then about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2013 estimate 3,600 remained in orbit.1 of those about 1,000 were operational2 while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit 20,000km, and the rest are in geostationary orbit 36,000km.3 a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids,4 and the sun  satellites are used for many purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit  a launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane air launch to orbit  satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude

treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite  the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick Moon.56 the idea surfaced again in jules vernes the begums fortune  konstantin tsiolkovsky  in 1903, konstantin tsiolkovsky published exploring space using jet propulsion devices russian which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this  in 1928, herman potonik published his sole book the problem of space travel the rocket motor das problem der befahrung des weltraums der raketen-motor he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments  animation depicting the orbits of gps satellites in medium earth orbit  in a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications.7 he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet  the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948, that his office was coordinating that project between the various services.8  artificial satellitesedit  sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite to orbit earth  the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1, launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957, and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states  sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1s success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold war  sputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named Laika.9  in may 1946, project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth Century.10 the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air forces project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954, the secretary of defense stated know of no american satellite program.11 in february 1954 project rand released uses for a satellite vehicle written by rr Carhart.12 this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with scientific use of an artificial satellite by hk kallmann and ww Kellogg.13  in the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the us intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.  following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the armys which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civiliannavy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2, the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958.14  in june 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1, the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites.15  early satellites were constructed as designs with growth in geosynchronous satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the HS-333 geo commsat launched in 1972.  the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space station  1U cubesat ESTCube-1, developed mainly by the students from the university of tartu carries out a tether deployment experiment in low earth orbit  space surveillance networkedit  main article united states space surveillance network  the united states space surveillance network a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earths orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26,000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earths atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites satellites the rest are space debris.16 the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles  non-military satellite servicesedit  there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services17  fixed satellite servicesedit  fixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earths surface  mobile satellite systemsedit  mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world andor other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems  scientific research satellites and noncommercialedit  scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data remote sensing amateur radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric research  typesedit  astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objects  biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentation  communications satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits molniya orbits or low earth orbits  earth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring meteorology map making etc especially earth observing system  navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with ever-improving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time  satellites are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads satellites and other space assets  crewed spacecraft are large satellites able to put humans into beyond an orbit and return them to earth spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable systems have major propulsion or landing facilities they can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations  miniaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes.18 new classifications are used to categorize these satellites minisatellite microsatellite 100kg, nanosatellite 10kg.citation needed  reconnaissance satellites are earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications very little is known about the full power of these satellites as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified  recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological space-production and other payloads from orbit to earth  international space station  space stations are artificial orbital structures that are designed for human beings to live on in outer space a space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit for periods of weeks months or even years  tether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether  weather satellites are primarily used to monitor earths weather and climate.19  orbit typesedit  main article list of orbits  various earth orbits to scale cyan represents low earth orbit yellow represents medium earth orbit the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit the green dash-dot line the orbit of global positioning system satellites and the red dotted line the orbit of the international space station  the first satellite sputnik 1, was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,45920 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricity  the commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit medium earth orbit and high earth orbit low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786km. high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786km.  centric classificationsedit  geocentric orbit an orbit around the planet earth such as the moon or artificial satellites currently there are approximately 1,45920 artificial satellites orbiting the earth  heliocentric orbit an orbit around the sun in our solar system all planets comets and asteroids are in such orbits as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet  areocentric orbit an orbit around the planet mars such as by moons or artificial satellites  the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links  altitude classificationsedit  low earth orbit geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180km 2,000km  medium earth orbit geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000km 35,786km also known as an intermediate circular orbit  geosynchronous orbit geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 35,786 kilometres the period of the orbit equals one sidereal day coinciding with the rotation period of the earth the speed is approximately 3,000 metres per second  high earth orbit geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit 35,786km  orbital altitudes of several significant satellites of earth  inclination classificationsedit  inclined orbit an orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not zero degrees  polar orbit an orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution therefore it has an inclination of very close to 90 degrees  polar sun synchronous orbit a nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local time on every pass useful for image taking satellites because shadows will be nearly the same on every pass  eccentricity classificationsedit  circular orbit an orbit that has an eccentricity of 0 and whose path traces a circle  hohmann transfer orbit an orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit usually the orbit of a planet to another using two engine impulses the perihelion of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the sun as the radius of one planets orbit and the aphelion is at the other the two rocket burns change the spacecrafts path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit and later to the other circular orbit this maneuver was named after walter hohmann  elliptic orbit an orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an ellipse  geosynchronous transfer orbit an elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low earth orbit and the apogee at the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit  geostationary transfer orbit an elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low earth orbit and the apogee at the altitude of a geostationary orbit  molniya orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4 and orbital period of half of a sidereal day 12 hours such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the planet russia and the united states  tundra orbit a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4 and orbital period of one sidereal day 24 hours such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet  synchronous classificationsedit  synchronous orbit an orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period is 23 hours 56 minutes 4.091 seconds of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body to a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma 8 in the sky  semi-synchronous orbit an orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200km and an orbital period equal to one-half of the average rotational period is approximately 12 hours of the body being orbited  geosynchronous orbit orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786km such a satellite would trace an analemma 8 in the sky  geostationary orbit a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.21  clarke orbit another name for a geostationary orbit named after scientist and writer arthur c clarke  supersynchronous orbit a disposal storage orbit above gsogeo satellites will drift west also a synonym for disposal orbit  subsynchronous orbit a drift orbit close to but below gsogeo satellites will drift east  graveyard orbit an orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation  disposal orbit a synonym for graveyard orbit  junk orbit a synonym for graveyard orbit  areosynchronous orbit a synchronous orbit around the planet mars with an orbital period equal in length to mars sidereal day 24.6229 hours  areostationary orbit a circular areosynchronous orbit on the equatorial plane and about 17000km miles above the surface to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky  heliosynchronous orbit a heliocentric orbit about the sun where the satellites orbital period matches the suns period of rotation these orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 gm au around the sun a little less than half of the orbital radius of mercury  special classificationsedit  sun-synchronous orbit an orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets surface at the same local solar time such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging spy and weather satellites  moon orbit the orbital characteristics of earths moon average altitude of 384,403 kilometers ellipticalinclined orbit  pseudo-orbit classificationsedit  horseshoe orbit an orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in co-orbit with the planet see asteroids 3753 and 2002 AA29.  exo-orbit a maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it  suborbital spaceflight a synonym for exo-orbit  lunar transfer orbit  prograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of less than 90. or rather an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary  retrograde orbit an orbit with an inclination of more than 90. or rather an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit this is because when the rocket starts out on the ground it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude  halo orbit and lissajous orbit orbits lagrangian points  satellite subsystemsedit  the satellites functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the of a typical satellite one discovers two modules.17 note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy  spacecraft bus or service moduleedit  the bus module consists of the following subsystems  structural subsystemedit  the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage  telemetry subsystemedit  the telemetry subsystem command and data handling cdh monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control stations commands to perform equipment operation adjustments  power subsystemedit  the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earths shadow nuclear power sources thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program  thermal control subsystemedit  main article spacecraft thermal control  the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellites body optical solar reflector  attitude and orbit control subsystemedit  main articles attitude control and spacecraft propulsion  the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators wheels thrusters these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directions  communication payloadedit  the second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable of  receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations  amplifying received radio signals  sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through inputoutput signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations  end of lifeedit  when satellites reach the end of their mission normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1. launched in 1958, vanguard 1, the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009.23  instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit.24 as of 2002, the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch.25 in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78km, with a range between 72 and 84km. solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95km.26  launch-capable countriesedit  main article timeline of first orbital launches by nationality  this list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the date this capability was first demonstrated the list includes

national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1985, tried to launch a satellite using its own vls 1 launcher three times in 1997, 1999, and 2003, but all attempts were unsuccessful  north korea claimed a launch of Kwangmyngsng-1 and Kwangmyngsng-2 satellites in 1998 and 2009, but us russian and other officials and weapons experts later reported that the rockets failed to send a satellite into orbit if that was the goal the united states japan and south korea believe this was actually a ballistic missile test which was a claim also made after north koreas 1998 satellite launch and later rejectedby whom the first 2012 launch of Kwangmyngsng-3 was unsuccessful a fact publicly recognized by the dprk however the december 2012 launch of the version of Kwangmyngsng-3 was successful

jamming.109110  also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellites transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectivelycitation needed  satellite servicesedit  satellite crop monitoring
