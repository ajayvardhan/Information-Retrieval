references  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on september 16. a low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the african coast and the caribbean on september 20. the next day the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression.15 the depression moved westward in excess of 20mph and reached tropical storm strength-becoming tropical storm lili as it passed through the windward Islands.6 the cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the caribbean sea reaching a peak strength of 70mph on the morning of september 24.7 this was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening and the storms maximum sustained winds dropped to 40mph later that day.8 the sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear.9 the system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning and remained in that state for nearly two days  lili regenerated near jamaica on the evening of september 26 and gradually turned more to the west-northwest while strengthening.1 the system became a hurricane on september 30, just after passing through the cayman Islands.10 the storm continued on its course while continuing to intensify and made landfall twice the next day on the isle of youth and near pinar del ro as a Category2 hurricane.11 lili emerged over the gulf of mexico later that day having lost little strength during its overland passage.112  the system turned to the northwest and sped up becoming a major hurricane on october 2 while 365 miles south-southeast of new Orleans.13 this intensification continued aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the gulf of mexico and good outflow.14 the system reached its peak strength of category4 intensity with winds of 145mph during that afternoon.15  this strength was not maintained for long the storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of october 3,16 and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricanes final landfall near intracoastal city louisiana due to a combination of vertical wind shear cool waters just offshore Louisiana,17 and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant.18 by the time of landfall maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90mph the weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall.1 the system continued inland curving to the north-northeast and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the arkansastennessee border on october 6.1  preparationsedit  national hurricane center track forecast of lili from september 30  tropical storm watches were issued in parts of the lesser

dissipating tropical storm.1 the storms major impact was extremely heavy rainfall in excess of 16 inches near the settlement of camp-perrin Haiti.42 this caused the ravine du sud river to overflow and submerge buildings in the town two people died in the mudslides these rains triggered and two more drowned in the flooding around Camp-Perrin.43 the floods also seriously damaged crops and infrastructure over 1700homes were damaged and 240 were destroyed haiti was affected dramatically and many towns and villages submerged into rivers exceeding their bankfull discharge43  jamaicaedit  lili affected jamaica as a strengthening tropical storm wind gusts in excess of 70mph and rainfall over 2 feet resulted in damage to homes crops and utility systems.121  extremely heavy rainfall inundated the island cedar valley recorded the most rainfall with 23.1 inches measured this led to prolific flooding that triggered mudslides across the island and killed four people these floods decimated the islands sugar cane crop one of the islands principal exports.21 the resultant flooding caused widespread problems with the infrastructure of the island all of the islands hospitals had flood damage and three were also dealt structural damage by the strong winds.44 the flooding caused latrines and other sewage sources to overflow into the intake sources for the water supply leading to fear of disease.44  cubaedit  hurricane lili over cuba on october 1  lili made landfall as a category two hurricane twice in cuba on the isle of youth and in the pinar del ro province on october 1.

severely as only 945homes were damaged with 500 losing their roofs the provinces in eastern cuba including guantanamo suffered similar damage.46 electricity outages for whole towns lasted weeks in parts of the western provinces this led to loss of running water due to unpowered pumps and deliveries of fresh water had to be made to remote villages.45 the tobacco and rice crops were badly depleted but it was difficult to differentiate how much damage was caused by lili since isidore had struck the region just a week earlier.4547  louisianaedit  lili storm total rainfall in the united

hurricane lili caused great environmental damage to the marshes and barrier islands in louisiana huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point and in the atchafalaya swamp the barrier islands to the east of the landfall point those subjected to the highest surge were severely eroded sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes burying vegetation the freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge some of them completely destroyed the severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the gulf of mexico which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.60  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  the name lili was retired in the spring of 2003 because of its
