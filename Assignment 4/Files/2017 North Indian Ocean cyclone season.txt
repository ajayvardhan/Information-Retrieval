official bounds but cyclones tend to form between april and december with the two peaks in may and november these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern indian ocean  the scope of this article is limited to the indian ocean in the northern hemisphere east of the horn of africa and west of the malay peninsula there are two main seas in the north indian ocean the arabian sea to the west of the indian subcontinent abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department and the bay of bengal to the east abbreviated bob by the imd the official regional specialized meteorological centre in this basin is the imd while the joint typhoon warning center releases unofficial advisories on average three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.12  contents  1 seasonal forecast  2 season summary  3 systems  3.1 cyclonic storm maarutha  3.2 severe cyclonic storm mora  3.3 deep depression bob 03  3.4 depression bob 04  3.5

which formed in late may over the bay of bengal the system made landfall in bangladesh with three-minute sustained winds of 110kmh and one-minute sustained winds of 120kmh at this strength its peak intensity it was equivalent to a marginal category 1 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale the cyclone produced severe flooding across sri lanka india myanmar and bangladesh and caused 15 deaths directly and 203 deaths indirectly the floods persisted in bangladesh since a deep depression over bay of bengal made landfall and killed 156 people in bangladesh a depression formed in northwestern bay of bengal and produced torrential rainfall it was followed by a depression over jharkhand which killed 70 people in west bengal under the influence of strong monsoon surge a

depression in early hours of 17th, into a depression in the morning and well marked low pressure area over central myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17th.9  maarutha had already triggered

further the depression tracked into an environment with strong wind shear and failed to intensify making landfall on the odisha coast near paradip during the afternoon of 20 October.55 after landfall the system remained near the coastline allowing moisture incursion from the bay of bengal to prevent rapid weakening initially tracking northwards the system soon recurved towards the northeast before

of 62kmh the names were selected by members of the escapwmo panel on tropical cyclones between 2000 and may 2004, before the regional specialized meteorological center in new delhi started to assign names in september 2004. there is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin from the western pacific then it will retain its original name the next six available names from the list of north indian ocean storm names are below  maarutha
