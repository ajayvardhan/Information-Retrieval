hispaniola jamaica honduras belize guatemala eastern mexico  part of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane iris of 2001 was the most destructive hurricane in belize since hurricane hattie in 1961. iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 atlantic hurricane season behind hurricane Michelle.1 it was the ninth named storm fifth hurricane and third major hurricanenb 1 of the year forming from a tropical wave on October4 just southeast of barbados it moved westward through the caribbean intensifying into a tropical storm on October5 south of puerto rico and into a hurricane the following day while passing south of the dominican republic iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides killing eight people later the hurricane passed south of jamaica where it destroyed two houses on reaching the western caribbean sea iris rapidly intensified into a Category4 on the saffirsimpson scale a small hurricane with an eye of only 7mi in diameter iris reached peak winds of 145mph before making landfall in southern belize near monkey river town on October9. the hurricane quickly dissipated over central america although its remnants contributed to the formation of tropical storm manuel in the eastern pacific ocean  destruction was heaviest in belize and totaled 2 because iris was compact the damage was largely confined to 72 of the houses in the toledo district and 50 of the houses in the stann creek district the hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide and wrecked more than 95 of the homes in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country iris left about 15,000people homeless many receiving assistance from the government and the local red cross chapter high winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops mostly affecting the banana industry iris killed 24people in belize including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near big creek the storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring guatemala and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern mexico where two people died  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  3.1 lesser and greater antilles  3.2 offshore  3.3 belize  3.4

saffirsimpson scale  toward the end of september 2001, a poorly defined tropical wave moved westward across the tropical atlantic ocean through an area of hostile wind shear which was caused by a large upper-level low within a trough to the northeast of the lesser Antilles.3 a few days later the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the caribbean sea allowing for an upper-level ridge or high-pressure area to form over the tropical wave the change provided a favorable environment for tropical development and an area of convection soon blossomed along the waves axis as the tropical wave approached the lesser antilles a mid-level wind circulation formed within the deepest part of the convection and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined the system increased in organization enough to be classified as tropical depression eleven at 1200UTC on October4, located about 100mi southeast of Barbados.3 operationally however hurricane hunters did not confirm the depressions formation until nine hours later.4  in its early stages the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of st vincent and st lucia under the influence of a strong ridge to its north compared to its appearance 24hours before forming the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized.4 this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight into the system which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depressions well-organized appearance on satellite imagery.5 at 2100UTC on October5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60mph based on these data the depression was upgraded to tropical storm iris situated about 155mi south of the southern coast of puerto Rico.6 in post-season analysis the national hurricane center estimated that iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.3  hurricane iris in the western caribbean sea on october 8  despite the storms intensification and well-organized satellite appearance the circulation failed to become better defined.3 in their first discussion on iris the nhc mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed.4 one forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south.6 although its overall appearance did not change significantly the hurricane hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi and a stadium effect curvature on October6.7 later that day iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the dominican Republic,3 and the nhc remarked that land interaction with the greater antilles was the only factor impeding further development.8 after iris reached winds of 85mph early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours.3 during that time the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted possibly due to an upper-level low.9 by late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with iris extended only 25mi from its 16mi wide eye.1011  early on October8, after turning west-southwestward away from the greater antilles iris began strengthening again with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear the nhc predicted peak winds of 105mph before the storm would hit Belize.12 it rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions intensifying from 95mph to 140mph in a 12-hour period on October8, making iris a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale in the same duration the minimum central pressure dropped 38mbar while intensifying the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi for comparison the smallest known eye diameter on record for an atlantic hurricane was about 3mi during hurricane wilma in 2005.14 with such a small eye a hurricane hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of Iris,13 and shortly after the flight the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the honduras coastline just offshore this resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle but within a few hours iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph just off belize at 0200UTC on October9, it made landfall at peak intensity in monkey river town in the southern portion of Belize.3  initially hurricane iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing central america and to re-intensify in the eastern pacific ocean had it done so it would have retained the name Iris.13 instead the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of guatemala and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm late on October9, within sixteen hours of landfall the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico.3 as the remnants approached the pacific ocean a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of iris it gradually organized while continuing westward developing into tropical storm manuel the new storm ultimately lasted until October18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.15  preparationsedit  over a stretch of four days sixteen tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with iris affecting the dominican republic the cuban provinces of granma and santiago de cuba jamaica cayman islands the yucatn peninsula guatemala honduras and Belize.3 the threat from iris prompted the jamaica national emergency operations center to be activated shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.16  in belize a hurricane warning was issued about 23hours before iris moved ashore.3 a state of national emergency was declared on October8 as hurricane iris neared landfall all emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts.17 a mandatory evacuation was issued for stann creek and toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands the main hospital in belize city was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order.18 overall 11,380people evacuated their homes in Belize,19 including many in belize City.20 these evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll.21 hurricane keith had struck the nation a year prior preparing some citizens for what to expect.20 disaster response teams arrived the day after iris was projected to make landfall pan american health organization staff were on standby in belize guatemala and honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks.18  on October8, the government of honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions advising residents to expect weather conditions.22 about 5,000people in the country evacuated from their homes to the north of belize officials in mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports.23  impactedit  death toll by area  statecountry  deaths  belize  23  dominican republic  3  guatemala  8  mexico  2  total  36  lesser and greater antillesedit  while iris was in its development stages residents as far north as saint thomas reported rain and thunderstorms.24 in the dominican republic iris dropped around 3in of rainfall along the coast forcing 35families to evacuate their homes after rivers exceeded their banks the rains triggered a landslide outside of santo domingo that destroyed a home killing a family of three there was another landslide in the region that injured two people.25 iriss passage near jamaica destroyed two houses and damaged the roofs of two others causing one injury otherwise damage in the country was minimal.16  offshoreedit  a 120ft scuba diving boat overturned during the hurricane near big creek belize possibly hit by a tornado.26 the boat named the wave dancer had 28people on board,3 including 20 from the richmond dive club out of richmond virginia most of them were upstairs in the boat and none were diving the captain had delayed returning to shore and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock not anticipating the ferocity.27 iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock causing it to overturn in 12ft waters.2627 eight people survived and 11bodies were recovered it was presumed that 20people died during the wreck,3 including 15 from the richmond area and three crew members.26  another boat the vendera also reportedly capsized with people on board.3  belizeedit  wettest

1995  central farm meteorological station   hurricane iris moved ashore in belize with winds of 145mph although the highest measured winds were 106mph at a station in big creek because of its small diameter iris produced heavy damage only in a 70mi area of southern belize in that region the hurricane produced a storm surge of up to 15ft with waves of over 13ft in height,21 causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes.35  as it moved ashore iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages.36 in 35villages, the storm destroyed more than 95 of the buildings.37 its small size confined the worst damage largely to toledo and stann creek districts which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country.2138 the percentage of damaged houses was 72 in toledo district and about 50 in stann Creek,39 leaving about 15,000people homeless.40 in both districts the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies.37 in the worst-affected areas poor mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned.37 at placencia near the coast about 80 of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage with downed power poles in the streets.21 about 90 of the houses in nearby seine bight were destroyed,41 and where iris made landfall over 90 of the homes were destroyed throughout monkey river Town.21 the storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern belize iris also damaged tourism facilities including minor impact to the maya ruins of Belize,42 and damaged 20 of the hotel rooms in the country accounting for in losses.43 the remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.44  in southern belize the storms strong winds left crop damage in some cases where the harvest had just begun about 5,000 acres of bananas were destroyed along with over 3,500 acres of rice 3,000 acres of corn and other crops to a lesser degree.42 the storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock the shrimp industry lost 25 of its catch,42 partly due to contaminated waters.45 crop damage in belize was estimated at mostly from banana losses.42 iriss strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest with upwards of 40 of trees affected in some areas.42 this disrupted the habitats of several animals and it is likely that many of the howler monkeys near monkey river were killed.46 the storms strong waves eroded the beach although marine effects were much less than those of hurricane keith in the previous year.42 nevertheless there were reports of fish die-offs after the storm possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter.46  nationwide iris damaged or destroyed 3,718homes,47 directly affecting a total of 21,568people,38 or 8.5 of the total population.48 the storm damaged or destroyed 31schools and 17health facilities,38 along with 21government buildings.49 there was about in damage to the transportation sector including highways and bridges.43 iris killed 24people in and around the country,50 including the victims of the wave dancer shipwreck.51 overall damage was estimated at making it the most damaging storm in the country since hurricane hattie in 1961.44  elsewhere in central americaedit  high tides and heavy rainfall caused power outages across both guatemala and Honduras.20 in the former the hurricanes rainfall generally amounted to 3 to 4in to 102mm, triggering flash flooding and landslides that injured nearly 100people.53 the damage was heaviest in petn department in the northern portion of the country.54 the storm damaged 26schools and 2,500homes in the countrys interior.5556 an estimated 27,500people were affected by the storm throughout Guatemala.53 there were eight deaths in the country,3 two of them the result of falling trees.57  the remnants of iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern mexico accumulating 4.80in in the southern state of Chiapas.58 in oaxaca the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120houses. a mudslide in one village demolished 20homes and killed a child while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept away in a flooded river.59  aftermathedit  on October9, the government of belize issued the clear signal indicating that the storm had fully passed and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment.60 the government declared stann creek and toledo districts as disaster areas,45 and officials declared a nighttime curfew by the day after the storm struck the airport in belize city had been reopened and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal.41 residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water forcing them to drink unclean water.37 officials sent medical teams to southern belize in the most affected areas.21 the belmopan red cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money clothing and food for storm victims.41 the red cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000people.51 by October19, most roads in southern belize were reopened the belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs and officials authorized spending to rebuild damaged homes to assist the farmers who lost crops the belize government provided 18,000lb of maize seeds as well as fertilizer.39 after the storm the world food programme and the belize red cross collectively provided food for the 9,000families in need of subsidence.61 by October31, the red cross had provided blankets tarps and hygienic supplies to 4,800people severely affected by the storm.62 homes were gradually repaired and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. around christmas of 2001, the belize red cross provided presents to school children in 14villages affected by the storm.47 the lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22 in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.63  the government of belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following iriss landfall,64 and various countries provided aid.41 the united kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water the united states also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting.65 although sustaining significant damage the government of guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in Belize.66 mexico sent blankets mattresses food and water as well as a medical team.65 the japanese government sent tents and blankets,67 and the chinese government donated 500lb of rice and dried fruits.65 various united nations departments donated about  the american victims of the wave dancer boat wreck were flown back to the richmond virginia area following the storm.26 the insurance company covering the boat reached a settlement which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims families the boat operator remained in business following the accident.27  following the major damage in belize the name iris was retired in the spring of 2002 by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was subsequently replaced by the name ingrid and was first used during the 2007 season.68  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  list of retired atlantic
