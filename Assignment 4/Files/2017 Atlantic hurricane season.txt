hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual formation of tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin the season has been hyperactive,1 featuring both the highest total accumulated cyclone energy and the highest number of major hurricanes since the 2005 season it has the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era with franklin through ophelia all reaching winds of at least 75mph in addition it has thus far been a very destructive season the most destructive season on record in fact with a preliminary total of over billion in damages nearly all of which was due to three of the major hurricanes of the season harvey irma and maria this season is also one of only six years on record to feature multiple Category5 hurricanes irmas landfalls on multiple caribbean islands and marias landfall on dominica make 2017 the second season on record 2007 to feature two hurricanes making landfall at Category5 intensity in addition irma was the strongest hurricane ever recorded to form in the atlantic ocean outside of the gulf of mexico and caribbean Sea.2 this season is the only season on record in which three hurricanes each had an ace of over 40 irma jose and maria  the season officially began on June1 and will end on November30. these dates historically describe the period of year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin and are adopted by convention however as shown by tropical storm arlene in april the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at other times of the year arlene also marked 2017 the third consecutive year to feature a pre-season storm in mid-june tropical storm bret struck the island of trinidad which is only rarely struck by tropical cyclones due to its low latitude a few days later tropical storm cindy struck the state of louisiana in late august hurricane harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005, while also setting the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record as well as the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the us in early september hurricane irma a cape verde-type hurricane became the first category 5hurricane to impact the northern leeward islands on record as well as equaling the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the atlantic basinthe 1935 labor day hurricane with hurricane maria striking puerto rico as a high-end Category4, the season was the first on record to feature three atlantic hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the united states or one of its territories at Category4 intensity or stronger the season also featured the fastest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the gulf of mexico this was the first season to have three hurricanes make landfall in the mainland united states irma and nate since 2008, and the first season to feature four hurricanes making landfall in the overall united states irma maria and nate since 2005. the season also featured ophelia the easternmost major hurricane in the basin on record which later became the costliest hurricane to affect the united kingdom and ireland in history  beginning in 2017, the national hurricane center has the option to issue advisories and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48hours. such systems are termed tropical cyclones advisories on these storms contain the same content including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings as advisories on active tropical cyclones.3 the first storm to receive this designation was potential tropical cyclone two which later developed into tropical storm bret east-southeast of the windward islands on June18.4 in addition the numbering that a potential tropical cyclone receives would be retained for the rest of the hurricane season meaning that the next tropical system would be designated with the following number even though potential tropical cyclones do not qualify as tropical cyclones this was first demonstrated with potential tropical cyclone ten which failed to develop into a tropical cyclone  contents  1 seasonal forecasts  1.1 pre-season outlooks  1.2 mid-season outlooks  2 seasonal summary  3 systems  3.1 tropical storm arlene  3.2 tropical storm bret  3.3 tropical storm cindy

services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms hurricanes and major or higher on the saffirsimpson scale hurricanes will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies include the tropical storm risk consortium of the university college london the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and colorado state university the forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a particular year.6 some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the dissipation of the 201416 el nio event on average an atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms six hurricanes and two major hurricanes with an accumulated cyclone energy index of between 66 and 103units.5  pre-season outlooksedit  the first forecast for the year was issued by tsr on december 13, 2016.6 they anticipated that the 2017 season would be a near-average season with a prediction of 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes they also predicted an ace index of around 101units.6 on december 14, csu released a qualitative discussion detailing five possible scenarios for the 2017 season taking into account the state of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the possibility of el nio developing during the season.21 tsr lowered their forecast numbers on april 5, 2017 to 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes based on recent trends favoring the development of el Nio.7 the next day csu released their prediction also predicting a total of 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes.8 on april 17, the weather company released their forecasts calling for 2017 to be a near-average season with a total of 12 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes.9 the next day on april 18, north carolina state university released their prediction also predicting a near-average season with a total of 1115 named storms 46 hurricanes and 13 major hurricanes.10 on may 20, the weather company issued an updated forecast raising their numbers to 14 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes to account for tropical storm arlene as well as the decreasing chance of el nio forming during the season.11 on may 25, noaa released their prediction citing a 70 chance of an above average season due to weak or nonexistent el nio calling for 1117 named storms 59 hurricanes and 24 major hurricanes.12 on may 26, tsr updated its prediction to around the same numbers as its december 2016 prediction with only a minor change in the expected ace index amount to 98units.13  mid-season outlooksedit  csu updated their forecast on june 1 to include 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include tropical storm Arlene.14 it was based on the current status of the north atlantic oscillation which was showing signs of leaning towards a negative phase favoring a warmer tropical atlantic and the chances of el nio forming were significantly lower however they stressed on the uncertainty that the el niosouthern oscillation could be in a warm-neutral phase or weak el nio conditions by the peak of the season.14 on the same day the united kingdom met office released its forecast of a very slightly above-average season it predicted 13 named storms with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range between 10 and 16, and 8 hurricanes with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range between 6 and 10. it also predicted an ace index of 145, with a 70 chance that the index would be between 92 and 198.15 on july 4, tsr released their fourth forecast for the season increasing their predicted numbers to 17 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes due to the fact that el nio conditions would no longer develop by the peak of the season and the warming of sea-surface temperatures across the basin additionally they predicted a revised ace index of 116units.16 during august 9, noaa released their final outlook for the season raising their predictions to 1419 named storms though retaining 59 hurricanes and 25 major hurricanes they also stated that the season had the potential to be extremely active possibly the most active since 2010.20  seasonal summaryedit  main article timeline of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season  three simultaneous hurricanes active on september 8, with katia irma and jose all three were threatening land at the time  the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1, 2017, although activity began earlier for the third consecutive year since 2015. roughly a month before the official start the first storm arlene developed on april 19 in the northern atlantic ocean it was the first named storm to develop in the month of april since ana in 2003. in june two more tropical storms developed bret which affected areas in the southeastern caribbean sea including trinidad and tobago and cindy which formed in the gulf of mexico less than a day after bret had developed in july a tropical depression developed in the main development region the second tropical cyclone to develop in the mdr before the month of august after bret and was followed by tropical storm don at the end of that month a cold front stalled over the gulf of mexico and portions of the southeastern united states spawning tropical depression six which quickly developed into tropical storm Emily.22  august featured the seasons first hurricane franklin which formed in the bay of campeche a few days after franklin dissipated tropical storm gert formed northeast of the bahamas eventually becoming a hurricane at a high latitude over the western atlantic on august 17, tropical storm harvey formed east of the windward islands before opening up into a wave over the central caribbean three days later harvey then regenerated into a tropical depression over the southwestern gulf of mexico on august 23, and rapidly strengthened into a Category4 hurricane before making landfall near rockport texas late on august 25. harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005, the first Category4 hurricane to make landfall in texas since carla in 1961, and the first Category4 hurricane landfall in the contiguous united states since charley in 2004.22  most intense atlantic  hurricane seasons  1850nb 1  rank  season  ace  1  1933  259  2  2005  250  3  1893  231  4  1926  230  5

september featured copious activity irma formed in the eastern atlantic and rapidly intensified into a Category5 hurricane east of the leeward islands irma is the strongest hurricane in terms of sustained winds since wilma in 2005, and the strongest hurricane outside of the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico on record while irma impacted the northern leeward islands hurricane jose formed on september 5, peaking as a high-end Category4 hurricane before weakening and making an anti-cyclonic loop in the northern atlantic ocean when katia formed 2017 became the first year since 1998 in which six hurricanes have formed in a row.25 on september 17, maria became a Category5 hurricane threatening the same areas devastated by hurricane irma when lee intensified into a major hurricane on september 27, it became the first time in seven years that five major hurricanes formed activity briefly paused as september came to a close  activity resumed on october 4, when tropical depression sixteen formed in the southwestern caribbean sea which strengthened into tropical storm nate on the next day as it neared the coast of nicaragua nate strengthened to a hurricane on october 7, and made two landfalls in the united states as a category 1 hurricane the first near the mouth of the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana late on october 7 and the second near biloxi mississippi early october 8. as nate became a post-tropical cyclone on october 9, tropical depression seventeen formed in the eastern subtropical atlantic strengthening into tropical storm ophelia that same day ophelia became a hurricane two days later marking the first time since 1893 that 10 consecutive named storms strengthened into hurricanes on october 14, ophelia unexpectedly strengthened into a major hurricane becoming the sixth major hurricane of the season and the easternmost major hurricane in the atlantic basin on record after this the basin went quiet for some time late in the month tropical storm philippe formed south of cuba  the accumulated cyclone energy index for the 2017 atlantic hurricane season as of 0000UTC on October30, is 221.3250units,nb 2 which is one of the highest values on record for an atlantic hurricane season as well as the most since 2005, and more than double the 19812010 full-season median of 92 units with an ace value under 4units following the dissipation of emily 2017 set the record for lowest ace produced by a seasons first five named storms.26 despite that the 2017 season hosted the storm with the third-highest ace value irma at 66.6 units and is one of only four seasons 1966, 2003, and 2004 to have at least two hurricanes with an ace value over 40 and the only season to have had three.27 2017 also hosted the day with the most ace produced 8 and currently has the fourth highest ace value of any atlantic season since 1950.22 september also generated the highest ace value for any month in the atlantic surpassing September2004.28 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39mph which is tropical storm strength  systemsedit  tropical storm arleneedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  april 19 april 21  peak intensity  50mph 990mbarhPa  see also list of off-season atlantic hurricanes  a potent extratropical cyclone formed well east of bermuda on April16. the cyclone moved southeast becoming disconnected from the surrounding environment and gradually losing its frontal characteristics deep convection formed in bands north and east of the center by 0000UTC on April19, leading to the formation of a subtropical depression despite an unfavorable environment with ocean temperatures near 20C and moderate wind shear convection coalesced near the center and allowed the subtropical depression to become fully tropical by 0000UTC on April20. it intensified into tropical storm arlene six hours later after attaining peak winds of 50mph the storm began to rotate around a larger extratropical low the storm tracked into the cold sector of the cyclone causing arlene to lose tropical characteristics around 1200UTC on April21. the post-tropical cyclone moved south and east before dissipating well west-southwest of the azores on April22.29  upon its formation as a subtropical depression on April19, arlene was the sixth known subtropical or tropical cyclone to form in the month of april in the atlantic basin the other instances were ana in 2003, a subtropical storm in april 1992, and three tropical depressions in 1912, 1915, and 1973, respectively when arlene became a tropical storm on April20, this marked only the second such occurrence on record after ana in 2003.30nb 3 furthermore it had the lowest central pressure of any atlantic storm recorded in the month of april with a central pressure of 990mbar 29.23inHg, again surpassing Ana.32 additionally unrelated to arlene tropical storm adrian in the eastern pacific basin also formed before the corresponding hurricane season was set to officially begin being the earliest named storm in the eastern pacific proper this makes 2017 the second consecutive year after 2016 where the first storms in both basins were pre-season storms.33  tropical storm bretedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  june 19 june 20  peak intensity  45mph 1007mbarhPa  main article tropical storm bret  a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on june 13 and was first monitored by the national hurricane center shortly afterwards.34 development however was expected to be slow due to its low latitude and relatively fast motion as it moved swiftly across the main development region of the atlantic ocean the disturbance began to gradually organize and the nhc raised development chances slightly on june 16.35 little change in organization occurred until june 18, at which point a burst of convection near the center of the disturbance prompted the nhc to designate the system as potential tropical cyclone two at 2100UTC. this was the agencys first designation of a disturbance that had not yet developed into a tropical cyclone.36 the storm continued to organize as it accelerated towards venezuela and trinidad and tobago throughout the night with banding features becoming evident later on june 19, the system developed a closed low-level circulation and was upgraded to tropical storm bret at 2100UTC.37 one day later at 2100UTC on june 20, the last advisory on bret was issued following its degeneration into a tropical wave.38  according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university bret was the earliest storm to form in the main development region on record surpassing a record set by tropical storm ana in 1979.39 bret was also the lowest latitude named storm in the month of june since 1933 at 9.4N.40 in trinidad one person died after he slipped and fell while running across a makeshift bridge the fatality is considered indirectly related to Bret.4142 another fatality occurred in tobago after a mans house collapsed on him he eventually succumbed to his injuries a week later.43  tropical storm cindyedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  june 20 june 23  peak intensity  60mph 992mbarhPa  main article tropical storm cindy  the nhc first began monitoring the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the northwestern caribbean sea on June13.44 a large area of disturbed weather developed within the region three days later,45 and it slowly organized while entering the central gulf of mexico prompting the nhc to begin advisories on a potential tropical cyclone on June19. the structure of the system was initially sprawling with tropical storm-force winds well displaced from a broad area of low pressure with embedded swirls.46 a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system around 1800UTC the following day was able to pinpoint a well-defined center indicating the formation of tropical storm Cindy.47 despite the presence of dry air and strong wind shear the cyclone still managed to attain peak winds of 60mph before weakening on approach to the louisiana coastline.48 it made landfall between port arthur texas and cameron louisiana early on June22 and weakened while progressing inland.49  a state of emergency was declared for biloxi mississippi in anticipation of flooding a ten-year-old boy died from injuries sustained during the storm in fort morgan Alabama.50 a second fatality later occurred in bolivar peninsula Texas.51  tropical depression fouredit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  july 5 july 7  peak intensity  30mph 1009mbarhPa  early on June29, the nhc began tracking a tropical wave embedded within a large envelope of deep moisture across the coastline of western Africa.52 the disturbance was introduced as a potential contender for tropical cyclone formation two days later as environmental conditions were expected to favor slow organization.53 it began to show signs of organization over the central atlantic early on July3,54 but the chances for development began to decrease two days later as the system moved toward a more stable environment.55 having already acquired a well-defined circulation the development of a persistent mass of deep convection around 0300UTC the following day prompted the nhc to upgrade the wave to tropical depression four located about 1,545miles east of the lesser Antilles.56 despite wind shear being low the nascent depression struggled to intensify due to a dry environment caused by a saharan air layer to its east causing the low-level circulation to weaken and resulting in the tropical depression degenerating into an open tropical wave late on the next day.57  tropical storm donedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  july 17 july 19  peak intensity  50mph 1007mbarhPa  late on July15, the nhc highlighted a low-pressure trough over the central atlantic as having the potential to develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming days.58 the disturbance began to show signs of organization early on July17,59 and data from a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system confirmed the development of tropical storm don around 2100UTC that day.60 the storms overall appearance improved over subsequent hours up until around 0900 utc as a central dense overcast accompanied by significant clusters of lightning became pronounced.61 don attained its peak intensity at this time characterised by winds of approximately 50mph the next plane to investigate the cyclone a few hours later however found that the systems center had become less defined and that sustained wind speeds had decreased to about 40mph a combination of reconnaissance data and surface observations from the windward islands indicated that don opened up into a tropical wave around 0300UTC on July19, as it entered the eastern caribbean Sea.63  tropical storm emilyedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  july 31 august 2  peak intensity  45mph 1005mbarhPa  in late july a dissipating cold front extended into the northeastern gulf of mexico where the nhc began forecasting the development of an area of low pressure over the next day on July30. any development was expected to be slow due to land proximity and marginal upper-level winds.64 contrary to predictions a rapid period of organization occurred over the next 24 hours and the system was deemed as tropical depression six at 0900UTC on July31,65 strengthening into tropical storm emily just two hours later after attaining its peak intensity with winds of 45mph and a minimum pressure of 1,005mbar emily made landfall on anna maria island around 1445UTC. weakening quickly ensued and later that day the circulation of emily became elongated as it was downgraded to a tropical depression.67 the increasingly disrupted system later moved off the first coast of florida into the western atlantic early the next day accelerating northeastwards before becoming embedded within a frontal zone early on August2.68  following the classification of tropical storm emily florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency for 31counties to ensure residents were provided with the necessary resources.69 the storm spawned an EF0 tornado near bradenton the tornado was on the ground for about 1.3mi and destroyed two barns and a few greenhouses while an engineered wall collapsed leaving about in damage.70 on August1, torrential rains related to emily impacted parts of miami beach with accumulations reaching 6.97in in 3.5hours, of which 2.17in fell in just 30minutes.71 coinciding with high tide the deluge overwhelmed flood pumps with three of them shutting down due to lightning-induced power outages and resulted in significant flash floods multiple buildings suffered water damage with some having 2.5ft of standing water one person was hospitalized after becoming stuck in flood waters.7273 portions of downtown miami such as brickell were also heavily affected numerous vehicles became stranded in flooded roadways.74  hurricane

caribbean sea for possible development on august 3.75 after organizing for a few days advisories were initiated on potential tropical cyclone seven at 2100UTC on august 6.76 the disturbance became tropical storm franklin at 0300UTC on august 7.77 after strengthening into a moderate tropical storm franklin made its first landfall near pulticub mexico at 0300UTC on august 8.78 the cyclone weakened considerably while over the peninsula however its satellite presentation remained well-defined with the inner core tightening up considerably.79 later that day franklin emerged into the bay of campeche and immediately began strengthening again becoming a hurricane late on August9.80 five hours after peaking in intensity with winds of 85mph and a pressure of 981mbar franklin made landfall in lechuguillas Mexico,82 and thereafter began to rapidly weaken by 1500UTC on August10, franklin had dissipated as a tropical cyclone.83 however its mid-level circulation remained intact and later contributed to the formation of tropical storm jova in the eastern pacific early on August12.84  immediately upon classification of franklin as a potential tropical cyclone tropical storm warnings were issued for much of the eastern side of the yucatn peninsula on august 676 a small portion of the coastline was upgraded to a hurricane watch with the possibility of franklin nearing hurricane intensity as it approached the coastline the next night approximately 330 people were reported as going into storm shelters and around 2,200 relocated from the islands near the coastline to farther inland in advance of the storm.85 in the mexican part of the peninsula damage was reported as having being minimal mainly in belize as the storm tracked slightly more northwards then expected lessening impacts.85 nonetheless some areas received up to a foot of rain.86  hurricane gertedit  category 2hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 13 august 17  peak intensity  105mph 967mbarhPa  on August2, the nhc began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection over the western coast of Africa.87 as the disturbance tracked west-northwest its structure changed little in organization but environmental conditions were expected to support the formation of a tropical cyclone.88 instead the system remained poorly defined and entered a less conducive environment east of the leeward Islands.89 after progressing into the southwestern atlantic several days later the wave encountered more favorable upper-level winds and began to show signs of organization.90 following the formation of a well-defined circulation the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 0300UTC on August1391 by 2100UTC that afternoon it intensified into tropical storm Gert.92 at 0300UTC on August15, gert intensified to a Category1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75mph making it the second hurricane of the season.93 accelerating east-northeastwards gert peaked as a Category2 system early on August17 at an unusually high latitude of 40N.94 thereafter gert began to rapidly weaken as it shifted from the gulf stream over cooler waters.95 just 12hours after achieving peak intensity gert weakened below hurricane status and evolved to an extratropical cyclone well east of nova Scotia.96  two people drowned due to strong rip currents produced by the hurricane one in the outer banks of north carolina and the other in nantucket Massachusetts.9798  hurricane harveyedit  category 4hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 17 september 1  peak intensity  130mph 938mbarhPa  main article hurricane harvey  the nhc began monitoring an area of low pressure southwest of cape verde on august 13, which was expected to merge with a tropical wave that just emerged off the coast of africa within a few days.99 instead the two systems remained separate,100 with the first low pressure area coalescing into a potential tropical cyclone by 1500UTC on August17.101 a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system was able to locate a well-defined circulation and the disturbance was upgraded to tropical storm harvey accordingly six hours later.102 on a westward course into the caribbean sea the storm was plagued by relentless wind shear and it degenerated to an open tropical wave south of hispaniola by 0300UTC on August20.103 harveys remnants continued into the bay of campeche where more conducive environmental conditions led to the re-designation of a tropical depression around 1500UTC on August23, and subsequent intensification into a tropical storm by 0400UTC on the next morning.104105 the tropical cyclone began a period of rapid intensification shortly thereafter attaining hurricane intensity by 1700UTC on August24,106 Category3 strength around 1900UTC on August25,107 and Category4 intensity by 2300UTC on that day.106  harvey crossed the shore between port aransas and port oconnor texas around 0300UTC on August26, possessing maximum winds of 130mph the storm gradually spun down becoming a tropical storm around 1800UTC on August26, as it meandered across southeastern Texas.109 a light steering pattern caused the storm to emerge into the gulf of mexico on August28,110 but a turn toward the north-northeast brought it ashore west of cameron louisiana as a weak tropical storm around 0900UTC on August30.111 the system weakened to a tropical depression over central louisiana late that day before losing tropical characteristics over central tennessee early on September1.112113  rockport fulton and the surrounding cities bore the brunt of harveys eyewall as it moved ashore in texas numerous structures were heavily damaged or destroyed boats were tossed or capsized power poles were leant or snapped and trees were downed as debris covered roadways and cellphone service was compromised communication to the hardest-hit locales was severed one person was killed in rockport after a fire began in his home and approximately a dozen people were injured.114 farther northeast dire predictions of potentially catastrophic flooding came to fruition in houston and nearby locales where floodwaters submerged interstates forced residents to their attics and roofs and overwhelmed emergency lines the national weather service tweeted event is unprecedented all impacts are unknown beyond anything experienced at least 30 people were killed in the houston area due to flooding.115 in addition to the flooding harvey spawned several tornadoes around Houston.116 estimates place the damage caused by harvey at harvey killed 90 people including 1 in Guyana118 and 89 in the united States.119120121122 the storm produced 64.58 in of rainfall in texas the highest-ever rainfall total for any tropical cyclone in the united states and the third-highest rainfall total for a tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin.123nb 4  harvey was the first major hurricane to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005, ending the record-length 4,323-day span in which no tropical cyclones made landfall as major hurricanes.124 it is the most intense tropical cyclone to move ashore the us mainland since hurricane charley in 2004,

environment of low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures the newly formed cyclone moved generally westward while intensifying a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system east of the caribbean on September5 found the cyclone at Category5 intensity.128 with a clear eye surrounded by a ring of extremely deep convection irma attained its peak intensity with winds of 185mph later that day,129 and maintained this intensity as it moved through the northern leeward Islands.130 some weakening occurred south of the Bahamas,131 but the cyclone regained Category5 intensity before making landfall on the sabana-camagey archipelago of cuba around 0300UTC on September9.132 land interaction disrupted the storm temporarily,133 but once again it strengthened to acquire winds of 130mph before making landfall in cudjoe key of the florida keys early on September10.134 a few hours later it struck marco island florida with winds of 115mph irma continued north and west steadily weakening over the southeastern united states before losing tropical characteristics in georgia early on September12.136  with peak winds of 185mph irma is the strongest atlantic storm outside of the gulf of mexico or caribbean sea on record and is the 11th most intense hurricane on record in the atlantic basin maintaining peak intensity for 37 consecutive hours irma is the only tropical cyclone on record worldwide to have had winds that intense for so long as the storm moved through the northern leeward islands it became the only Category5 to make a direct impact there its landfall intensity ties it with the 1935 labor day hurricane as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the atlantic two Category4 hurricanes harvey and irma struck the continental united states in the span of two weeks this marks the first time the country has suffered two landfalls of such intensity during the same hurricane season in recorded history lastly irma accrued the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy index on record.137  in the aftermath of irma development on the islands of barbuda and saint martin was described as being destroyed by respective political leaders with 1,400 people feared homeless in Barbuda.138 so far irma has resulted in at least 134 deaths including 44 across the caribbean and 90 in the united States.139140141  hurricane joseedit  category 4hurricaneSSHWS  duration

jose over the open eastern atlantic by 1500UTC on September5.143 the quickly-strengthening cyclone attained hurricane intensity late on September6,144 reached major hurricane strength late on September7,145 and ultimately peaked as a high-end Category4 hurricane with winds of 155mph early on September9.146 moderate wind shear weakened the cyclone as it conducted a slow clockwise loop between bermuda and the caribbean sea and eventually moved north ahead of an approaching trough.147 steering currents collapsed by early on September21, causing the system to stall offshore the northeastern united states as a weakening tropical storm.148 with a rain shield in the northern and northwestern semicircles accompanied by a lack of deep convection over the center the nhc declared jose a post-tropical cyclone around 0300UTC on September22, ending advisories once the storms tropical storm-force winds moved off the new england coast at 2100 UTC.149150  the government of antigua and barbuda began efforts on september 8 to evacuate the entire island of barbuda prior to joses anticipated arrival as most structures on the island had been heavily damaged or destroyed by hurricane Irma.151  hurricane katiaedit  main article hurricane katia  category 2hurricaneSSHWS  duration  september 5 september 9  peak intensity  105mph 972mbarhPa  a trough was present over the southwestern gulf of mexico on September3, producing a widespread area of thunderstorms.152 two days later a distinct low pressure area formed about 50mi east of tampico Tamaulipas.153 at 2100UTC that day the nhc designated the system as tropical depression thirteen after an organized area of convection formed over the center located in an area of weak steering currents the depression drifted slowly eastward with gradually decreasing wind shear and warm water temperatures the system intensified into tropical storm katia on September6, as the convection became better organized.154155 later that day an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the storm found a partial eye wall and surface winds of 76mph on that basis the nhc upgraded katia to hurricane status.156 the convection organized into a central dense overcast as the system stalled.157 late in the evening of september 8, katia made landfall north of tecolutla mexico as a weak Category1 storm.158 the system rapidly dissipated over land on september 9. katias remnants traveled across central america and later emerged over the pacific ocean where redevelopment ensued tropical depression fifteen-e formed which later strengthened into hurricane otis about a week later.159  in preparation for katia over 4,000 residents were evacuated from the states of veracruz and Puebla.160 tourists left coastal towns emergency shelters were opened and storm drains were cleared before the onset of heavy rainfall.161 two fatalities were reported in xalapa from mudslides while a third man was swept away by floodwaters in jalcomulco states of emergency were declared for 40 out of a total 53 municipalities that reported minor damage from mudslides and flooding.162 about 77,000 residents were left without power at the height of the storm.163  hurricane leeedit  category 3hurricaneSSHWS  duration  september 15 september 30  peak intensity  115mph 962mbarhPa  a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 13. contrary to predictions of only gradual organization over the following days,164 the system rapidly organized becoming tropical depression fourteen at 0300UTC on september 15.165 the nhc upgraded the system to tropical storm lee at 1500UTC on the next day based on an increase in deep convection and an advanced scatterometer pass which indicated that it was producing minimal tropical-storm-force winds.166 after encountering wind shear lee gradually weakened into a tropical depression early on September17 before degenerating into a remnant low two days later.167168 the nhc monitored the remnants of lee intermittently for several days but regeneration was not considered likely.169170 however the mid-level remnants of the cyclone became intertwined with an upper-level trough a deep burst of convection led to a new surface circulation and by 2100UTC on September22, the system reorganized into tropical depression Lee.171 it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later.172  a compact cyclone lee organized as small curved bands wrapped into a small cluster of central convection.173 a microwave pass around 2100UTC on September23 indicated the formation of a ring of shallow to moderate convection around the center often a harbinger of rapid intensification.174 indeed by 0630UTC the next morning the presence of an eye on satellite imagery prompted the nhc to abruptly upgrade lee to a hurricane as it moved erratically.175 after attaining winds of 90mph the storm weakened slightly due to moderate southeasterly wind shear.176 by 0900UTC on September26, however the storm attained Category2 strength.177 an eyewall replacement cycle that night led to the emergence of a larger eye surrounded by cold cloud tops and by 1500UTC on September27, lee attained its peak as a Category3 hurricane with winds of 115mph the system recurved northeast after peak intensity and quickly succumbed to strong northerly wind shear and progressively cooler ocean waters179 it weakened below major hurricane strength by 0300UTC on September28,180 fell below hurricane strength by 1500UTC on September29,181 and degenerated to a post-tropical cyclone by 0900UTC on September30, after lacking deep convection for over 12 hours.182 on october 1, lees remnant was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone to the north.183  hurricane mariaedit  category 5hurricaneSSHWS  duration  september 16

24-hour period ending at 2345UTC on September18, maria doubled its winds from 80mph to 160mph thus reaching Category5 strength.187 after striking dominica at that intensity a little over an hour later,188 the storm weakened slightly as it entered the eastern caribbean sea amid favorable conditions however maria regained Category5 intensity and eventually reached peak winds of 175mph late on September19.189 around 0800UTC on September20, the eyewall of maria struck Vieques,190 and a little over two hours later the core of the storm made landfall near yabucoa puerto rico with winds of 155mph land interaction caused a significant degration in marias structure and it weakened to a Category2 hurricane while moving offshore.192 growing in size and curving north maria regained Category3 strength and maintained this intensity for several days before entering a less conducive environment.193 after fluctuating between tropical storm and minimal hurricane strength off the coastline of north Carolina,194 the system turned sharply east away from the united states and ultimately evolved into an extratropical cyclone over the far northern atlantic on September30.195196  dominica sustained catastrophic damage from maria with nearly every structure on the island damaged or destroyed.197 surrounding islands were also dealt a devastating blow with reports of flooding downed trees and damaged buildings puerto rico also suffered catastrophic damage the islands electric grid was devastated leaving all 3.4 million residents without power many structures were leveled while floodwaters trapped thousands of citizens the united states national guard coast guard army corps of engineers and other like units worked to administer aid and assist in search and rescue operations however the us federal government response was criticized for its delay in waiving the jones act a statute which prevented puerto rico from receiving aid on ships from non-us flagged vessels along the coastline of the united states tropical storm-force gusts cut power to hundreds of citizens rip currents offshore led to three deaths and numerous water rescues estimates of damage from maria range from billion by estudios tcnicos to billion by moodys Analytics.198 most of the damage occurred in puerto rico ricardo rossell the governor of puerto rico believes the storm caused billion in

deemed a tropical storm and named Nate.204 nates first us landfall was in the mouth of the mississippi river as a category 1 hurricane and nates second us landfall was at 1230 am cst near biloxi ms both on october 8. after nate tracked inland it quickly weakened into a tropical depression and a few hours later evolved into an extratropical storm hurricane nate also broke the record for the fastest moving hurricane ever recorded in the gulf of Mexico.205  nate caused at least 40 deaths including 16 in Nicaragua,206 11 in costa Rica,207 7 in Panama,208 3 in Honduras,208 1 in el

the northeast it began to lose its frontal system and acquire subtropical characteristics by october 7.212 the next day the storm encountered stronger wind shear removing some of its convection and slightly weakening the system however the storm eventually grew better organized and developed more convection around its low pressure center later in the day.213 early on october 9, the system fully transitioned into a tropical cyclone prompting the nhc to begin issuing advisories on tropical depression Seventeen.214215 the tropical depression continued to strengthen becoming tropical storm ophelia later that day.216 ophelia continued to strengthen due to low wind shear and on october 11, the national hurricane center upgraded it to a hurricane making it the tenth consecutive storm this season to reach hurricane strength.217 ophelia became a category 2 hurricane on october 12 at 500p.m. ast UTC.218 on october 14 at 1100a.m. ast utc ophelia unexpectedly intensified to a category 3

the nhc to upgrade the system into potential tropical cyclone eighteen slow development occurred over the next day but the storm was ultimately deemed a tropical depression at 1500UTC on october 28, after it developed a well-defined low-level circulation.228 continued strengthening occurred throughout the day as it moved over cuba becoming tropical storm philippe near havana about six hours later shortly thereafter philippe became poorly organized as it interacted with a non-tropical area of low pressure and a cold front with the circulation becoming elongated with three vortices existing within a broader low-level circulation philippe then made landfall over the everglades in southwest florida with winds of 45 mph at around 900UTC on october 29. effects were relatively minor in florida although philippe did spawn a few weak tornadoes229 including one in west palm beach and another in Miami.230 after crossing the southern florida peninsula philippe began to intensify over the open atlantic reaching a peak strength of 60 mph however by 2100UTC, philippe dissipated as the circulation merged with a cold front that was part of a larger extratropical cyclone which was bringing heavy rain and wind to the northeastern united states and eastern canada philippe did not become a hurricane thus ending a record-tying period with 10 consecutive hurricanes winds of at least 75 mph  the combination of philippe and the extratropical system resulted in approximately 1.2million power outages in new england the system produced storm-force sustained winds reaching 57mph in warwick
