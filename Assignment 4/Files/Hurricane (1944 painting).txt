descriptionedit  although marin is best known for his watercolors beginning in the 1930s he developed an interest in the more expressive brushwork and rugged quality of oil paint marin was influenced by cubism with its flattened spaces and angularity he honed a style of frenetic brushwork to create this dynamic image of water wind and clouds he was so successful in his recreation of nature that a sailor purportedly declared it the first time he had seen a sea painted as the sea really is.1  historical informationedit  hurricane was painted the same year the great atlantic hurricane smashed
