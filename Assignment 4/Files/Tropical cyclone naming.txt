reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than 33 knots 38mph, names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate however standards vary from basin to basin some tropical depressions are named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones must have a significant

feast days on which they occurred.8 the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907.8 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western Pacific.8 formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian Ocean.8  at present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate the effective communication of forecasts and storm-related hazards to the general public.9 this is especially important when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously in the same ocean basin.9 names are generally assigned in order from predetermined lists once they produce one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65kmh however standards vary from basin to basin with some systems named in the western pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter pagasas area of responsibility.3 within the southern hemisphere systems must be characterized by a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named.56  any member of the world meteorological organizations hurricane typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists.126 a name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage impact or for other special reasons.1 a replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various reasons12 these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media.110 pagasa also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least 70091000000000000001billion in damage or have caused at least 300deaths.11  north atlantic oceanedit  main article list of retired atlantic hurricane names  image of hurricane nicole nearing peak

committee after each of the 14 members submitted 10 names in 1998.2 the order of the names to be used was determined by placing the english name of the members in alphabetical order.2 members of the
