19tropical storms or hurricanes.1 eighteen developed within the national hurricane center area of warning responsibility which is east of 140W, and one storm formed between 140W and the international date line which is under the jurisdiction of the central pacific hurricane center of the 19total storms eleven became hurricanes of which six attained major hurricane status within the nhc portion of the basin the season officially began on may 15, and in the cphc portion it started on june 1 the season officially ended on november 30. these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern pacific basin  the strongest storm of the season was hurricane ioke which reached category 5 status on the saffir-simpson scale in the central pacific ocean ioke passed near johnston atoll and later wake island where it caused heavy damage but no deaths the deadliest storm of the season was hurricane john which killed six people after striking the baja california peninsula and the costliest storm was hurricane lane which caused in damage in southwestern mexico 2017USD.  seasonal activity began on may 27, when tropical storm aletta formed off the southwest coast of mexico no storms formed in june though the season became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season as well as tropical storm emilia during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane lane three storms developed in october including hurricane paul and two formed in november this marked the second time on record after 1961, when more than one tropical storm developed in the basin

administrations cpc released their forecasts for the 2006 atlantic and pacific hurricane seasons the pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin noaa predicted a below-normal level of activity in the eastern pacific with 1216named storms of which 68 were expected to become hurricanes and 13 expected to become major hurricanes.3 the central pacific hurricane centers area of responsibility was also expected to be below average with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area.4 they expected that neither el nio nor la nia would affect conditions significantly.3  on may 15, the hurricane season began in the eastern pacific basin which is the area of the northern pacific ocean east of 140W.5 on june 1, the season began in the central pacific warning zone 140W and the international dateline however no storms occurred in the region until July.6  seasonal summaryedit  main article timeline of the 2006 pacific hurricane season  no tropical storms developed in june in the basin which was unusual compared to the average of two storms forming during the month since 1966, there have been only three other seasons in which a tropical storm did not form in june these being 1969, 2004, and 2007.7 after such an inactive month the tropics became active in july when five named storms developed including hurricane daniel which was the second strongest storm of the season during august hurricanes ioke and john formed as well as four other storms september was a relatively quiet month with two storms of which one was hurricane Lane.8 by that time however el nio conditions became established across the Pacific,9 which is known to enhance pacific hurricane activity.3  three storms developed in october including hurricane paul tropical activity within the basin in November2006 was the most active on record based on the accumulated cyclone energy index three tropical cyclones formed of which two became tropical storms only two other seasons on record 1961 and 2015, produced two tropical storms in the month of November.10 in addition mexico was struck by four tropical cyclones in 2006, none on the atlantic coast and all along the pacific coast.11 one hit baja california peninsula while the others made landfall on the mainland.12  an extratropical storm persisted in the extreme northern central pacific ocean in late october it drifted over unusually warm waters up to 3.6F above normal and gradually developed convection near the center by november 2, quikscat satellite suggested the system attained winds of up to 60mph about 900mi west of oregon the system also developed an eye and an eyewall the cyclone tracked northeastward as it gradually weakened and dissipated on november 4. nasa considered the cyclone to be a subtropical storm however as it formed outside of the territory of any monitoring organization it was not named operationally the united states navy treated the system as a tropical disturbance numbered 91C.13  systemsedit  tropical storm alettaedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  may 27 may 30  peak intensity  45mph 1002mbarhPa  main article tropical storm aletta  on May27, 12days into the season tropical depression one formed about 190miles south of Acapulco.14 it slowly organized and became a tropical storm with 45mph sustained winds.14 while named tropical cyclones in may are infrequent events aletta marked the seventh consecutive year to have a named cyclone form in May.15 the storm moved toward the guerrero coast in southwestern mexico prompting the mexican government to issue tropical storm watches between punta maldonado and Zihuatanejo.16 aletta then became stationary over the guerrero and oaxaca coastlines but it later turned to the west and dissipated on May30.14  aletta produced moderate rainfall across mexico including a 24-hour rainfall total of 3.94inches 1 in jacatepec oaxaca on May30, and 3.78inches in la calera guerrero the next day.16 there were no reports of damage flooding or casualties.1415  tropical depression two-eedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  june 3 june 5  peak intensity  35mph 1005mbarhPa  main article tropical depression two-e  on the day after aletta dissipated a new area of disturbed weather developed off the southwest mexican coast high shear slowed the development of the system although it gained enough convection and organization to be classified as a tropical depression on June3. the depression strengthened to near tropical storm status as it approached the coast of southwestern mexico however shear persisted over the system and it weakened before dissipating on June4.17  despite never becoming a named storm heavy rain occurred including a total of 19.13inches measured in a 48hour period in Acapulco.18 mudslides and flash flooding were reported,17 forcing 72people from their homes.19 no deaths or serious damage was reported.17  hurricane budedit  main article hurricane bud  category 3hurricaneSSHWS  duration  july 11 july 16  peak intensity  125mph 953mbarhPa  on July11, after over a month of inactivity a disturbance off the peninsula of baja california developed into a tropical depression it moved west-northwestward for its entire duration quickly intensifying into a tropical storm and hurricane a clear well-defined eye developed and bud became the first major hurricane of the season on July13, the hurricane attained peak winds of 125mph although cooler waters and stable air caused a marked weakening trend by July15, bud weakened to tropical depression status and the next day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.20 the remnants of bud produced light rainfall across Hawaii.21  hurricane carlottaedit  category 1hurricaneSSHWS  duration  july 12 july 16  peak intensity  85mph 981mbarhPa  a tropical wave exited africa on June30 and moved across the atlantic ocean without development on July9, while crossing central america into the eastern north pacific ocean thunderstorm activity increased and the system organized into tropical depression four-e early on July12 about 290mi south of zihuatanejo Guerrero.22 the large depression moved quickly to the west-northwest to the south of a ridge over northwestern mexico and its outer rainbands moved across the coast rainfall totals were less than 1inch the depression intensified into tropical storm carlotta just six hours after forming.22 by late on July12, the storm developed banding features,23 and early on July13 carlotta attained hurricane status about 430mi south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula.22  as carlotta intensified the system became more compact and it reached peak winds of 85mph on July13.22 an eye formed in the center and the hurricane was briefly forecast to attain major hurricane status or a Category3 on the saffir-simpson scale.24 however carlotta weakened due to increased wind shear from hurricane bud to its west,22 and the eye and convection deteriorated.25 carlotta briefly weakened to tropical storm status late on July14, although a decrease in shear allowed it to reintensify into a hurricane this was short-lived as the center moved into the area of cooler waters and carlotta again weakened to tropical storm status.22 late on July15, the circulation became separated from the convection,26 and carlotta weakened to tropical depression status on July16, and the next day generated into a remnant low the circulation continued generally westward dissipating on July20 about 1500mi east of the hawaiian islands.22  hurricane danieledit  category 4hurricaneSSHWS  duration  july 16 july 26  peak intensity  150mph 933mbarhPa  main article hurricane daniel  on July16, a tropical disturbance formed far to the south of the baja california peninsula and quickly increased in convective activity and organization becoming a tropical depression the system continued to organize and was designated as a tropical storm the next day on July18, daniel attained hurricane status and two days later underwent rapid intensification it reached major hurricane status and was later upgraded further to Category4 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale its peak intensity was 150mph the hurricane underwent eyewall replacement cycles which are internal mechanisms that occur in most intense hurricanes daniel later became an annular hurricane which allowed it to maintain Category4 status for longer than it otherwise would have.28  it crossed over into the central pacific early on July24 and was predicted to affect hawaii as a tropical storm however daniel encountered weak steering currents in the open ocean causing it to slow down considerably.27 it rapidly degenerated to a tropical depression on July25, and the cphc issued its last advisory on July26 while the storm was still well to the east of hawaii its remnants later moved across the hawaiian islands,27 dropping heavy rainfall and causing flooding.9 west wailuaiki on maui recorded 3.87inches in one day which was the highest daily rainfall total from the hurricane.21  tropical storm emiliaedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  july 21 july 28  peak intensity  65mph 990mbarhPa  main article tropical storm emilia  the origins of emilia were from a tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression on July21, a short distance off the coast of acapulco it moved generally north-northwestward reaching tropical storm status on July22 and passing about 175mi southwest of manzanillo Colima.29 an eyewall began to form that day,30 and emilia reached peak winds of 65mph it briefly weakened due to wind shear although restrengthening occurred as the storm turned toward the baja california peninsula on July26, emilia again reached peak winds of 65mph and shortly thereafter it passed about 60mi southwest of the southern tip of baja california it weakened as it turned into cooler waters first to tropical depression status on July27 and then to a convective-less remnant low on July28. the remnants dissipated on July31 about 495mi west-southwest of san diego California.29  in southwestern mexico emilia produced tropical storm force winds along the coastline rainfall in the southern portion of the baja california peninsula caused minor flooding and gusty winds caused damage to buildings and power lines.29 moisture from emilia reached the southwestern united states thunderstorms and rainfall occurred across arizona causing flooding.31 in southern california the storm dropped light rainfall which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.32  tropical storm fabioedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  july 31 august 3  peak intensity  50mph 1000mbarhPa  a tropical wave crossed the west coast of africa on July15 and entered the pacific on July25. convection increased on July28, and at 1800UTC on July31 the system became tropical depression seven-e about 980miles southwest of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula six hours later the depression was upgraded to tropical storm fabio it moved westward due to a ridge to its north and on August1 fabio reached peak winds of 50mph later the storm began weakening due to increased wind shear and dry air on August3, fabio deteriorated to tropical depression status and later that day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants continued westward moving across hawaii on August7.33  although fabio did not impact land its remnants produced heavy rainfall in hawaii in a 24-hour period 2.89inches of rainfall was recorded at glenwood on the island of hawaii this was the highest daily rainfall total for the month on the island however the heaviest precipitation fell on mount waialeale on kauai where 15.08inches fell in 24hours this total alone was greater than all other monthly rainfall totals in the state.34 the heavy rainfall flooded the hanalei river which forced the closure of the kuhio highway when a bridge was inundated.33 on oahu the rainfall caused ponding on roadways and flooding along streams one flooded stream stranded 24hikers along a trail all of whom required rescue by helicopter.35  tropical storm gilmaedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  august 1 august 3  peak intensity  40mph 1004mbarhPa  on July17, a tropical wave exited africa and crossed the atlantic without developing on July25 it entered the eastern pacific gradually developing an area of organized convection despite marginally favorable upper-level winds the system organized enough to be declared a tropical depression on August1, several hundred miles southwest of acapulco Mexico.36 initially the depression tracked west-northwestward.8 despite wind shear in the area,37 the depression was upgraded to tropical storm gilma later on August1. the wind shear prevented further strengthening or organization and gilma weakened to a tropical depression early on August2.36 the depression turned westward,8 and gilma degenerated into a remnant low by August4.36  hurricane hectoredit  category 2hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 15 august 23  peak intensity  110mph 966mbarhPa  a tropical wave exited africa on July31, and after no development in the atlantic it crossed central america into the northeastern pacific ocean on August10. convection gradually increased and a broad low pressure area developed about 375miles south of acapulco mexico on August13. the system continued to become organized and it developed into a tropical depression around 1800UTC on August15 about 650mi south-southwest of the southern tip of baja california it moved west-northwestward located south of a ridge that extended westward from northern mexico westward into the pacific the depression quickly intensified into tropical storm hector early on August16.38 hector was able to steadily strengthen reaching hurricane status at 0600UTC on August17. it is estimated that hector reached its peak intensity of 110mph at 0600UTC on August18, while centered about 1,035mi southwest of the southern tip of baja California.8  hector remained a category 2 hurricane for about 24hours.8 shortly thereafter it encountered cooler waters and westerly shear,39 and hector steadily weakened until becoming a tropical storm by August20. shortly thereafter the storm reached a weakness in the subtropical ridge which caused it to move slowly to the northwest by August21, deep convection was confined to the northeast portion of the circulation.40 the shear was not strong enough to completely weaken the tropical cyclone and hector remained a tropical storm with 50mph winds for about 24hours.38 after the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated on August22, the cyclone turned westward in response to the low-level easterly wind flow.41 hector weakened to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on August23, and to a remnant low sixhours later the remnant circulation of hector dissipated on August24 about 750mi east of the hawaiian Islands.42  hurricane iokeedit  category 5hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 20 august 27 basin  peak intensity  160mph 915mbarhPa  main article hurricane ioke  the cyclone developed from the intertropical convergence zone on August20 far to the south of hawaii encountering warm waters little wind shear and well-defined outflow ioke intensified from a tropical depression to category 4 status within 48hours. late on August22 it rapidly weakened to Category2 status before crossing over johnston atoll two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening and ioke attained Category5 status on august 25before crossing the international date line at the time its barometric pressure was estimated at 915mbar, thus becoming the strongest hurricane on record in the central Pacific.9 as it continued westward its intensity fluctuated and on August31 it passed near wake island with winds of 155mph ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward and by September6 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.43 by then the cyclone had lasted 19days, reaching the equivalent of category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale three times.9 the remnants of ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into Alaska.44  ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the central pacific or western pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon a crew of 12people stayed in a hurricane-proof bunker on johnston atoll during the hurricanes passage the crew estimated winds reached over 100mph which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the islands bird population.945 the hurricane left moderate damage on wake island totaling which resulted from blown off roofs and damaged buildings although the infrastructure of the island was left intact all military personnel were evacuated from the island the first full-scale evacuation of the island since typhoon sarah in 1967.464748 later the extratropical remnants of ioke produced a severe storm surge along the alaskan coastline causing beach erosion.49  hurricane ileanaedit  category 3hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 21 august 27  peak intensity  120mph 955mbarhPa  main article hurricane ileana  the origins of hurricane ileana were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of africa on August8. it entered the eastern north pacific on August16 and developed into a tropical depression on August21 near acapulco the depression strengthened into tropical storm ileana six hours after forming ileana continued to strengthen becoming a hurricane in 24hours and a major hurricane a day after that ileana reached its peak intensity of 120mph before beginning a slow weakening phase on August24 when it encountered cooler waters ileana weakened a tropical depression on the morning of August27 and quickly degenerated into a remnant low dissipating on August29.50 as ileana was heading north along the mexican coastline slight rainfall was recorded along the coast.51 there were also reports of hurricane-force winds on socorro Island.50 one fatality was reported when a man drowned in heavy surf near cabo san Lucas.52  hurricane johnedit  category 4hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 28 september 4  peak intensity  130mph 948mbarhPa  main article hurricane john  on August28, a persistent area of low pressure southwest of acapulco mexico developed into a tropical depression later that day it strengthened into a tropical storm and it reached hurricane strength 24hours later on August29. john underwent rapid intensification and reached Category3 intensity later that day and Category4 on August30.53 hours later the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle,54 and subsequently weakened to Category3 status as it paralleled the mexican coastline a short distance offshore.55 potentially due to its eyewall replacement cycle or its interaction with land hurricane john weakened to a 105mph hurricane by late on August31,56 but restrengthened to a major hurricane shortly after it made landfall near the southern tip of the baja california peninsula as a Category2 hurricane on September1.57 john continued northwestward along the eastern baja california peninsula weakening to tropical depression status by September3 and dissipating on September4 in the gulf of California.53  along the southwestern coast of mexico hurricane john produced heavy surf strong winds and heavy rainfall which flooded roads caused mudslides and downed trees.5358 along the baja california peninsula the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall with a 24-hour peak of 10.8inches in los Planes.59 the heavy rainfall caused flooding closed roads,60 and caused a dam to overflow.61 the winds and rainfall destroyed thousands of flimsy houses across the region.62 across mexico five people were killed,53 and damage amounted to 2006USD.63 moisture from the remnants of john produced flooding across texas which closed a mile portion of interstate 10 in el Paso.64 in southern new mexico the rainfall caused widespread street flooding and some minor damage.65 tropical moisture from the storm also produced rainfall in arizona and southern california where eight separate mudslides occurred trapping 19vehicles but causing no injuries.66  hurricane kristyedit  main article hurricane kristy  category 1hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 30 september 8  peak intensity  80mph 985mbarhPa  on August30, a tropical wave located about 525miles south-southwest of baja california became more organized and was designated as the twelfth tropical depression of the 2006season. it strengthened into tropical storm kristy and became hurricane kristy the next day it did not retain this status for long partly due to its proximity to hurricane John.67 there was a possibility of a fujiwhara interaction between both systems causing kristy to weaken or perhaps be absorbed into the circulation of John.68 this did not occur however kristy weakened steadily after its peak intensity and looked to be close to dissipating but on September3 and again on September5, convection flared up and it returned to tropical storm strength.67 after oscillating between storm and depression strength the system degenerated into a remnant low on September7, which dissipated on September8 without affecting land.67  hurricane laneedit  category 3hurricaneSSHWS  duration  september 13 september 17  peak intensity  125mph 952mbarhPa  main article hurricane lane  on September13, a tropical disturbance located about 125miles west-southwest of acapulco mexico gradually became better organized and was designated the thirteenth tropical depression of the 2006season. the depression intensified in a favorable environment and was upgraded to tropical storm lane later that night as it moved parallel to the mexican coast it continued to strengthen and became a hurricane on September15, and a major hurricane early the next day hurricane lane reached peak winds of 125mph before it made landfall on the coast of sinaloa on September16. it quickly weakened over land and dissipated on September17.69  tropical storm lane produced heavy rainfall and high seas along the west coast of mexico including acapulco where flood waters reached 16inches in depth the acapulco airport also experienced flooding though service was not interrupted.70 throughout mexico the hurricane caused four deaths and 2006USD in damage,71 half of which in sinaloa where heavy crop damage was reported.72 an estimated 4,320homes were affected by the hurricane and 19,200miles of roads and highways were damaged to some degree including some destroyed bridges.71  tropical storm miriamedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  september 16 september 18  peak intensity  45mph 999mbarhPa  a disturbance associated with a northerly extension of the intertropical convergence zone and a tropical wave developed a closed circulation on September15. it moved northeastward due to the influence from nearby hurricane lane and organized enough to be declared tropical depression fourteen-e on September16 while located about 500miles southwest of cabo san lucas mexico it quickly strengthened and organized into tropical storm miriam later that day after reaching a peak intensity of 45mph vertical wind shear and cooler waters rapidly weakened the storm and the circulation decoupled from the convection on September17. after turning more towards the north miriam weakened to tropical depression status and on September18 it degenerated to a remnant low the remnant circulation turned to the northwest then to the east and dissipated on September21 a short distance west of baja california no deaths are damage are associated with miriam and only one ship recorded winds of over tropical storm force near the center.73  tropical

convergence zone became sufficiently organized to be designated tropical depression two-c initially it was thought that the depression formed from the remnants of hurricane kristy although subsequent analysis confirmed they were two separate systems initially the depression was in an area of favorable conditions with little wind shear and warm waters.9 as a result the cphc predicted significant strengthening to at least hurricane status.74 instead a high pressure system to its north increased wind shear over the depression causing the convection to become removed from the center the depression weakened into a remnant low on September20, never reaching tropical storm status.9  tropical depression three-cedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  september 26 september 27  peak

nhc to initiate advisories on tropical depression sixteen-e on October9 about 1,360 miles to the west-southwest of the southern tip of baja California.79 influenced by a high pressure system the depression drifted northward.80 six hours after being upgraded to a tropical storm olivia attained peak winds of 45mph although the convection was limited to its northern side due to wind shear.81 on october 11, the convective activity diminished and olivia weakened to tropical depression status.82 olivia deteriorated into a remnant low on October13. it moved towards the east-southeast and on

as tropical depression four-c about 750mi southwest of honolulu hawaii upon being classified the depression was located in an unusual steering flow that caused it to track eastward due to the approach of an upper-level trough it was expected to dissipate quickly from wind shear although forecasters noted the possibility for the trough to provide an outflow channel which might allow strengthening.83 on October14, strong wind shear removed the convection completely from the center and the system degenerated into a remnant low.9  the remnant circulation continued slowly eastward dissipating on October16. concurrently the convection tracked northeastward ahead of the upper-level trough which contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding on the island of hawaii on October17.9 the rainfall event coincided with an kiholo bay earthquake striking the area.84  hurricane pauledit  category 2hurricaneSSHWS  duration  october 21 october 26  peak intensity  105mph 970mbarhPa  main article hurricane

 duration  october 26 october 27  peak intensity  35mph 1007mbarhPa  the origins of tropical depression eighteen-e were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of africa on October7. it briefly spawned a low-pressure area as the wave continued westward without development on October20, the wave entered the pacific ocean developing an area of thunderstorms about four days later by 1200UTC on October26, a tropical depression formed about 155mi south of Manzanillo.90 initially tropical depression eighteen-e was located in an area of light wind shear and the nhc anticipated further organization and strengthening to near hurricane status.91 the tropical depression initially maintained a steady westward motion away from the mexican coastline due to a ridge north of the cyclone.91 by October17, convection had decreased and the depression was not forecast to intensify as much.92 possibly due to intrusion of dry air the circulation became exposed from the thunderstorms and having weakened it turned to a southward drift.93 by 0000UTC on October28, the system had weakened to a non-convective remnant low which dissipated the following day.90  tropical storm rosaedit  tropical

its duration the storm maintained a northwest track through a weakness in a subtropical ridge.97 by November9, a new area of convection persisted near the center,98 and a banding feature formed.97 despite the shear the depression was upgraded to tropical storm rosa although the shear prevented intensification beyond its peak of 40mph rosa remained a tropical storm for only 18hours, becoming a tropical depression early on November10 and dissipating later that day.94 rosa was the first tropical storm in the basin to develop during november since 2000, and was also the first tropical depression to form in the month since 2002s tropical depression sixteen-e no impact was reported from the storm.94  tropical depression twenty-eedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  november 11 november 11  peak intensity  35mph 1007mbarhPa  a tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on October21, briefly developing two weak low pressure areas before the wave crossed into the pacific ocean on November1. thunderstorm activity slowly increased as the wave interacted within the intertropical convergence zone after a curved band of convection developed it is estimated the system formed into tropical depression twenty-e around 0000UTC on November11, about 550mi southwest of manzanillo throughout its duration the depression never completely separated from the intertropical convergence Zone.99 when the nhc issued its first advisory on the depression the agency predicted slight intensification to tropical storm status and for the depression to last at least two days this was due to a forecast of gradually increasing wind shear after the first 24hours.100 instead the circulation became very elongated it is estimated the cyclone degenerated into a trough

depression twenty-e degenerated into an open trough tropical depression twenty one-e developed from a tropical wave on November13 about 460miles south of manzanillo colima it steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward reaching peak winds of 110mph on November15. subsequently it began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north sergio later turned to the west remaining well off the coast of mexico and it dissipated on November20 about 320miles west-northwest of where it originally formed.101  sergio produced light rainfall along the coast of mexico though its effects were minimal.102 the formation of sergio marked the 2006 season as the most active in 12years and the second season in which more than one tropical storm formed in november after 1961. sergio set records for the month of november in the basin at the time it was considered the strongest hurricane to form in the month although it has since dropped to third after sandra from 2015, and kenneth from 2011. it is however still considered the longest-lived november pacific tropical cyclone with a duration of seven days.1101  other systemsedit  the cyclone at peak intensity in the northeast pacific on november 1.  main article 2006 central pacific cyclone  on october 28, 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone stalled over the northeast pacific ocean and began to strengthen by october 31, the storm had acquired tropical characteristics including an eye convection and a warmer-than-average core the system reached peak intensity on november 1, before slowly weakening and looping towards the pacific northwest the system made landfall in washington state on november 3, before rapidly weakening and dissipating on the next day during the duration of the storm the system was known as storm 91C invest 91C. the storms true nature still remains controversial among meteorologists today due to disputes over the storms exact structure and whether or not it had obtained tropical or subtropical characteristics because the storm was not within the area of responsibility of the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center the storm was never assigned a name  storm namesedit  the following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast pacific in 2006.103 this is the same list that was used in the 2000 season there were no names retired from
