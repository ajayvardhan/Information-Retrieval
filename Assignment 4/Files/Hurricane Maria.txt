puerto rico the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record maria was the thirteenth named storm seventh consecutive hurricane fourth major hurricane and the second Category5 hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 atlantic hurricane season at its peak the hurricane caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern caribbean compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the leeward islands already struck by hurricane irma just two weeks prior maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the leeward islands in two weeks after irma made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and hurricane jose passed dangerously close bringing tropical storm force winds to barbuda  originating from a tropical wave maria became a tropical storm on september 16, east of the lesser antilles remarkably favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc the hurricane reached Category5 strength on september 18 upon making landfall on dominica producing extreme winds across the entire island afterwards maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175mph and a pressure of 908mbar 26.81inHg, making it the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record weakening slightly but retaining its ferocious winds maria struck puerto rico as a high-end Category4 hurricane on september 20. interaction with land weakened the hurricane though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the bahamas moving slowly to the north maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on september 28. embedded in the westerlies maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open atlantic becoming extratropical on september 30 and dissipating by october 3.  as of november 3, at least 97people are confirmed to have been killed by the hurricane 54 in puerto rico 28 in dominica 5 in the dominican republic 4 in the contiguous united states 3 in haiti 2 in guadeloupe and 1 in the united states virgin islands hundreds of others mostly in dominica and puerto rico are still missing san juan mayor yuln cruz claimed that the actual death toll in puerto rico may actually be as high as 500.1 maria wrought catastrophic damage to the entirety of dominica which suffered an island-wide communication blackout much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair while the islands lush vegetation had been practically eradicated the islands of guadeloupe and martinique endured widespread flooding damaged roofs and uprooted trees puerto rico suffered catastrophic damage including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid for weeks in marias wake most of the islands population suffered from flooding and lack of resources compounded by the slow relief process total losses from the hurricane are estimated at between and billion usd mostly in puerto rico making marias cost comparable to that of previous hurricanes irma and Harvey.2345  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  2.1 puerto rico  2.2 mainland united states  3 impact in the

hurricane center began monitoring two tropical waves on september 13.6 the easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become hurricane lee while the western one continued moving generally westward with generally favorable conditions in the disturbances path development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely.7 during those two days the disturbance became better organized,8 and by september 16, convective banding became established around a poorly organized circulation as the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined the nhc initiated advisories on it as tropical cyclone fifteen at 1500UTC, in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the season.910 a mid-level ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for further development sea surface temperatures of 84F low wind shear and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the lesser Antilles.911 as the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day it was later upgraded to a moderate-range tropical storm based on satellite estimates at 2100UTC that day receiving the name Maria.12 at that time maria was situated 620mi east-southeast of the lesser Antilles.13  most intense atlantic hurricanes

center of circulation which enabled maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of september 17.11 after a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation,15 a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed hurricane hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of 74mph and a formative eye feature accordingly the nhc upgraded maria to hurricane status at 2100UTC.16 expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of September1718.17 considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricanes core early on september 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid intensification.18 explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120mph and a central pressure of 959mbar 28.32inHg, making maria a Category3 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale and hence a major hurricane additionally radar data revealed a well-defined 12mi wide eye.19 the eye contracted slightly to 9mi as intensification continued and the system reached Category4 strength by 2100UTC.20  radar imagery of hurricane maria from puerto rico at 0936UTC local time shortly before it stopped transmitting data  rapid intensification culminated late on september 18, with maria achieving Category5 status just 15mi east-southeast of Dominica.21 hurricane hunters observed surface winds of 160mph and a pressure of 925mbar 27.32inHg at this time.22 maria made landfall in dominica at 0115UTC on september 19,23 becoming the first Category5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation.24 interaction with the mountains of dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to Category4 however once over the caribbean sea maria regained Category5 intensity.2526 additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward puerto rico despite the formation of concentric eyewallsthe larger one spanning 25 to 35mi to 56km and the smaller only 5mi signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cyclethe inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon.27 maria attained its peak intensity around 0400UTC on september 20, roughly 30mi south of st croix sustained winds reached 175mph and its central pressure bottomed out at 908mbar 26.85inHg this ranks it as the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane since reliable records began.282930  infrared loop of hurricane maria passing stcroix vieques and landfalling on puerto rico on the morning of september 20  the hurricane made its closest approach to st croix around 0500UTC on september 20, passing within 20mi of the island the storms outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore.31 hours later around 0800UTC, the outer eyewall struck vieques an island off the eastern coast of puerto Rico.32 by this time the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed and the eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to Category4 strength.33 maria made landfall just south of yabucoa puerto rico around 1015UTC with sustained winds of 155mph making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928 san felipe segundo hurricane.35 maria maintained a general west-northwest course across puerto rico emerging over the atlantic ocean shortly before 1800UTC. interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening sustained winds fell to 110mph and the central pressure rose to 957mbars 28.26inHg.36 with favorable environmental conditions maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from puerto rico a large eye 45mi wide developed with deep convection blossoming around it early on september 21, the system regained Category3 intensity.37  initially cooler waters stirred up by hurricane irma two weeks prior limited marias reorganization.38 during the afternoon of september 21, the system traversed the navidad and silver banks north of the dominican republic shoaling from the regions shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds.39 convection around the storms eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125mph an increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall.4142 late on september 22, the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest.43 maria fluctuated in organization throughout september 23, with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled it maintained Category3 hurricane strength during this phase.4445 despite a decreasing central pressure the storm finally weakened to Category2 strength early on september 24. hurricane hunters observed flight-level winds of 116 to 135mph to 217kmh however surface wind returns by the noaas stepped-frequency microwave radiometer were only 90mph this indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft.4647 by this time marias trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off low over the eastern gulf of Mexico.47  weakening accelerated later on september 24 into september 25, as the hurricane traversed a cold wakewith sea surface temperatures of 7577F by hurricane jose a week prior maria degraded to Category1 strength during this time.48 early on september 25, marias structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed the low-level circulation became exposed to the northwest and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm.49 maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of september 26.50 however a sustained convective burst resulted in marias winds increasing to hurricane-force once again on september 27,51 with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation.52 despite this northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm and maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on september 28. simultaneously maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies.53 gradually weakening maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73F and below causing most of its convection to dissipate late on september 30, maria transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.54 during the next couple of days marias remnant accelerated towards the united kingdom while rapidly weakening.5556 marias remnants later crossed the iberian peninsula into the western mediterranean sea on october 3, before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same day.57  preparationsedit  this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it 2017  play media  the us navy helps evacuate military personnel from the us virgin islands ahead of hurricane

tropical storm watches for the islands of martinique and guadeloupe while st lucia issued a tropical storm watch for its citizens and the government of barbados issued a similar watch for Dominica.58 barbados would later that day declare a tropical storm watch for its citizens and saint vincent and the Grenadines.59 the government of antigua and barbuda issued hurricane watches for the islands of antigua barbuda st kitts nevis and montserrat by the time of the nhcs second advisory which declared maria a tropical storm.6061 the dominican republic activated the international charter on space and

approached.63 puerto rico electric power authority struggled with increasing debt reaching even before the hurricanes prompting them to file for bankruptcy furthermore the company lost 30percent of its employees since 2012. aging infrastructure across the island makes the grid more susceptible to damage from storms the median age of prepa power plants is 44years. inadequate safety also plagues the company and local newspapers frequently describe poor maintenance and outdated controls.64  the islands water system was also troubled before the hurricanes seventy percent of the island had water that didnt meet the standards of the 1974 safe drinking water act according to the natural resources defense Council.65  evacuation orders were issued in puerto rico in advance of maria and officials announced that 450 shelters would open in the afternoon of september 18.66 as of september 19, at least 2,000 people in puerto rico had sought shelter.67  mainland united statesedit  as maria

island.86 scattered rock slides landslides and uprooted trees caused minor damage and blocked some roads.87 several districts experienced localized blackouts due to downed or damaged power lines.88 the agricultural sector especially the banana industry suffered losses from the winds.87  heavy rainfall amounting to 35in caused scattered flooding across barbados in christ church the flood waters trapped residents from the neighborhood of goodland in their homes and inundated the business streets of saint lawrence Gap.9091 maria stirred up rough seas that flooded coastal sidewalks in bridgetown and damaged boats as operators had difficulties securing their vessels.92 high winds triggered an island-wide power outage and downed a coconut tree onto a residence in saint Joseph.9394  passing 30mi off the northern shorelines maria brought torrential rainfall and strong gusts to martinique but spared the island of its hurricane-force windfield,95 which at the time extended 25mi

damage with nearly every tree downed along the northern coast.102 there were no deaths on the island although four people were injured in the hurricanetwo seriously and two lightly.99  dominicaedit  an aerial view of part of roseau revealing widespread damage to roofs flash floods clogged roads with debris vegetative and structural and mud  rainfall ahead of the hurricane caused several landslides in dominica as water levels across the island began to rise by the afternoon of september 18.103 maria made landfall at 2115 ast that day utc september 19 as a Category5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160mph these winds the most extreme to ever impact the island,104 battered the roof of practically every homeincluding the official residence of prime minister roosevelt skerrit who required rescue when his home began to flood.105 downing all cellular radio and internet services maria effectively cut dominica off from the outside world the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricanes passage.106107 skerrit called the devastation boggling before going offline and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess damage.106 initial ham radio reports from the capital of roseau on september 19 indicated devastation with half the city flooded cars stranded and stretches of residential area  the next morning the first aerial footage of dominica elucidated the scope of the destruction.109 maria left the mountainous country blanketed in a field of debris rows of houses along the entirety of the coastline were rendered uninhabitable as widespread floods and landslides littered neighborhoods with the structural remnants.109110 the hurricane also inflicted extensive damage to roads and public buildings such as schools stores and churches,110 and affected all of dominicas 73,000 residents in some form or way.111 the air control towers and terminal buildings of the canefield and douglas charles airports were severely damaged although the runways remained relatively intact and open to emergency landings.111 the disaster affected all of the islands 53 health facilities including the badly damaged primary hospital compromising the safety of many patients.109112  a road in the roseau area is littered with structural debris damaged vegetation and downed power poles and lines  the infrastructure of roseau was left in ruins practically every power pole and line was downed and the main road was reduced to fragments of flooded asphalt the winds stripped the public library of its roof panels and demolished all but one wall of the baptist church.113 to the south of roseau riverside flooding and numerous landslides impacted the town of pointe michel destroying about 80 of its structures and causing most of the deaths in the country.114115 outside the capital area the worst of the destruction was concentrated around the east coast and rural areas where collapsed roads and bridges isolated many villages.111 the port and fishing town of marigot saint andrew parish was 80 damaged.116 settlements in saint david parish such as castle bruce good hope and grand fond had been practically eradicated many homes hung off cliffs or decoupled from their foundations in rosalie rushing waters gushed over the villages bridge and damaged facilities in its bay area throughout saint patrick parish the extreme winds ripped through roofs and scorched the vegetation buildings in grand bay the parishs main settlement experienced total roof failure or were otherwise structurally compromised many houses in la plaine caved in or slid into rivers and its single bridge was broken.117  overall the hurricane damaged the roofs of as much as 98 of the islands buildings,111 including those serving as shelters109 half of the houses had their frames destroyed.111 its ferocious winds defoliated nearly all vegetation splintering or uprooting thousands of trees and decimating the islands lush rainforests.118 the agricultural sector a vital source of income for the country was completely wiped out 100 of banana and tuber plantations was lost as well as vast amounts of livestock and farm equipment.111 in marias wake dominicas population suffered from an island-wide water shortage due to uprooted pipes the caribbean disaster emergency management agency estimates that the hurricane has caused of dollars worth of damage.119 as of october 9, there are 28fatalities confirmed across the island with another 32people reported missing.71  guadeloupeedit  numerous trees fell across guadeloupe clogging roadways with debris  blustery conditions spread over guadeloupe as maria tracked to the south of the archipelago which endured hours of unabating hurricane-force winds.120 the strongest winds blew along the southern coastlines of basse-terre island gourbeyre observed a peak wind speed of 101 mph while winds up north in nearby baillif reached 92mph along those regions the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20ft waves.122 the combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago especially from pointe--pitre along grand-terre islands southwestern coast to petit-bourg and the southern coasts on basse-terre Island.74 aside from wind-related effects rainfall from maria was also significant in just a day the hurricane dropped nearly a months worth of rainfall at some important locations pointe--pitre recorded a 24-hour total of 7.5inches while the capital of basse-terre measured 6.4in even greater quantities fell at higher elevations of basse terre island with a maximum total of 18.07in measured at the mountainous locality of matouba Saint-Claude.121  throughout the archipelago the hurricane left 40 of the population households without power and 25 of landline users without service.123 the islands of marie-galante la dsirade and especially les saintes bore the brunt of the winds which caused heavy damage to structures and nature alike and cut the islands off from their surroundings for several days.74123 homes on terre-de-haut island of les saintes were flooded or lost their roofs.124 on the mainland sections of pointe--pitre stood under more than 3.3feet of water and the citys hospital sustained significant damage.99 the basse-terre region suffered severe damage to nearly 100 of its banana crops comrpising a total area of more than 5,000 acres hectares farmers described the destruction to their plantations as annihilation.102 beyond their impact on farmland the strong winds ravaged much of the islands vegetation fallen trees and branches covered practically every major road and were responsible for one death.123 another person was killed upon being swept out to sea.74 two people disappeared at sea after their vessel capsized offshore la dsirade east of mainland Grande-Terre.123 damage from maria across guadeloupe amounted to at least 100

voceronewspaper 350 bodies are being stored at the institute of forensic sciences to the state medical examiners office many of which are still awaiting autopsies in the report hctor pesquera

for cremation the cause of death for the persons are listed as causes however.219 on november 3, 2017, san yuan mayor yuln cruz said that the actual death toll for puerto rico may be as high as 500,

note lower image date should read september 25, 2017  soon after the hurricane struck whitefish energya small montana-based company with only two full-time employeeswas awarded a contract by prepa to repair puerto ricos power grid the company contracted more than 300personnel and sent them to the island to carry out work prepa cited whitefishs comparatively small upfront cost of for mobilization as one of the main reasons for contracting them over larger companies prepa executive director ricardo ramos stated was the only company it was the first that could be mobilized to puerto rico it did not ask us to be paid soon or a guarantee to pay.220 no requests for assistance were made to the american public power association by October24.220 the decision to hire such a tiny company was considered highly unusual by many such as former energy department official susan tierney who stated fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out it is at least odd why utility would go to whitefish as the company was based in whitefish mont the hometown of us interior secretary ryan zinke this also led to accusations of privatization though zinke dismissed these claims and stated that he had no role in securing the contract.221 several representatives both democrats and republicans also voiced their concern over the choice to contract whitefish instead of other companies.220  in a press release on October27, fema stated it did not approve of prepas contract with whitefish and cited concerns.222 governor rossell subsequently ordered an audit of the contracts budget dhs inspector general john roth led the fema audit while governor rossell called for a second review by puerto ricos office of management and

restored.227  criticism of us government responseedit  san juan mayor carmen yuln cruz harshly criticized the federal response to maria in puerto rico as inadequate  the us department of homeland security did not immediately waive the jones act for puerto rico which prevented the commonwealth from receiving any aid and supplies from non-us-flagged vessels from us ports.228 the waiver was granted after two days while in contrast the waiver was not granted for hurricane harvey until fourteen days after the hurricane and was narrowly drafted to only allow fuel transportation for seven days.229 a dhs security spokesman said that there would be enough us shipping for puerto rico and that the limiting factors would be port capacity and local transport capacity.230230231232 this statement was supported by aflcio which issued a checking statement regarding the jones act and its effect upon recovery relief.233 the jones act was waived for a period of ten days starting on september 28 following a formal request by puerto rico governor Rossell.234  san juan mayor carmen yuln cruz called the disaster a humanitarian crisis and pleaded for relief efforts to be sped up on september 26.235 the white house contested claims that the administration was not responding effectively.236 general joseph l lengyel chief of the national guard bureau defended the trump administrations response and reiterated that relief efforts were hampered by puerto rico being an island rather than on the mainland.237 president donald trump responded to accusations that he does not care about puerto rico rico is very important to me and puerto rico the people are fantastic people i grew up in new york so i know many people from puerto rico i know many puerto ricans and these are great people and we have to help them the island is devastated.238 frustrated with the federal governments and inadequate response relief group oxfam announced on october 2 that it plans to get involved in the humanitarian aid effort sending a team to a targeted and effective response and support its local partners on-the-ground efforts.239  on october 2, 2017, oxfam released a rare statement the us government is engaged in relief efforts it has failed to address the most urgent needs oxfam has monitored the response in puerto rico closely and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the us government has mounted said oxfam americas president abby maxman oxfam rarely responds to humanitarian emergencies in the us and other wealthy countries but as the situation in puerto rico worsens and the federal governments response continues to falter we have decided to step in the us has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner.240 in an update on October19, the agency called the situation in puerto rico and called for more robust and efficient response from the us government.241  a rally for victims of the hurricane and puerto ricos status in general took place in long beach california on October3  on october 3, 2017, president trump visited puerto rico he compared the damage from hurricane maria to that of hurricane katrina saying you looked every death is a horror but if you look at a real catastrophe like katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overbearing nobody has seen anything like this what is your death count as of this morning 17.242 trumps remarks were widely criticized for implying that hurricane maria was not a catastrophe.243244 while in puerto rico trump also distributed canned goods and paper towels to crowds gathered at a relief shelter245 and told the residents of the devastated island hate to tell you puerto rico but youve thrown our budget a little out of whack because weve spent a lot of money on puerto rico and thats fine we saved a lot of lives.246  on october 12, trump tweeted cannot keep fema the military the first responders who have been amazing the most difficult circumstances in pr forever,247 prompting further criticism from lawmakers in both parties248 mayor cruz replied are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done.207 in response to a request for clarification on the tweet from governor rossell john f kelly assured that no resources were being pulled and replied country will stand with those american citizens in puerto rico until the job is done.249  see
