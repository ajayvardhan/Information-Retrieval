1011, formerly known as the taipei world financial center is a landmark supertall skyscraper in xinyi district taipei taiwan the building was officially classified as the worlds tallest in 2004, and remained such until the completion of the burj khalifa in dubai in 2010. in 2011, the building was awarded the leed platinum certification the highest award according to the leadership in energy and environmental design rating system and became the tallest and largest green building in the world.1112 it used to have the fastest elevator in the world traveling at 60.6kmh and transporting passengers from the 5th to 89th floor in 37 seconds.13 in 2016, the title for the fastest elevator was given to the shanghai tower in shanghai China.14  construction on the 101-story tower started in 1999 and finished in 2004. the tower has served as an icon of modern taiwan ever since its opening the building was architecturally created as a symbol of the evolution of technology and asian tradition its postmodernist approach to style incorporates traditional design elements and gives them modern treatments the tower is designed to withstand typhoons and earthquakes a multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of stores restaurants and clubs fireworks launched from taipei 101 feature prominently in international new years eve broadcasts and the structure

base of the tower  taipei 101 comprises 101 floors above ground as well as 5 basement levels it was not only the first building in the world to break the half-kilometer mark in height,3 but also the worlds tallest building from march 2004 to 10 march 2010.1516 as of 28 july 2011update, it is still the worlds largest and highest-use green building.1112  upon its completion taipei 101 was the worlds tallest inhabited building at 509.2m as measured to its height architectural top exceeding the petronas towers which were previously the tallest inhabited skyscraper at 451.9m the height to the top of the roof at 449.2m and highest occupied floor at 439.2m surpassed the previous records of 442m and 412.4m respectively the willis tower had previously held that distinction.317181920 it also surpassed the 85-story, 347.5m tuntex sky tower in kaohsiung as the tallest building in taiwan and the 51-story, 244.15m shin kong life tower as the tallest building in Taipei.2122 taipei 101 claimed the official records for the worlds tallest sundial and the worlds largest new years eve countdown clock.23  various sources including the buildings owners give the height of taipei 101 as 508m roof height and top floor height as 448m and 438m this lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a 1.2m platform at the base.13 ctbuh standards though include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement.17191820 taipei 101 displaced the petronas towers as the tallest building in the world by 57.3m the record it claimed for greatest height from ground to pinnacle was surpassed by the burj khalifa in dubai which is 829.8m in height taipei 101s records for roof height and highest occupied floor briefly passed to the shanghai world financial center in 2008, which in turn yielded these records as well to the Burj.1719  structural designedit  location of taipei 101s largest tuned mass damper  tuned mass damper  taipei 101 is designed to withstand the typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of 60 metres per second or 134mph, as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle.25  taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass curtain walls and other features.26 most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101, combined with the surrounding areas geologythe building is located just 660ft away from a major fault line27Taipei 101 used high-performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight packed with 10,000psi concrete.28 outrigger trusses located at eight-floor intervals connect the columns in the buildings core to those on the exterior.29  these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed.30 the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven 80m into the ground extending as far as 30m into the bedrock each pile is 1.5m in diameter and can bear a load of 1,0001,320 tonnes short tons.28 during construction on 31 march 2002, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from the 56th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed.29  rwdi designed a 660-tonne steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper at a cost of NT132million suspended from the 92nd to the 87th floor the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts its sphere the largest damper sphere in the world consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters each 125mm thick welded together to form a 5.5m diameter sphere two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing 6 tonnes short tons are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads.3435 on 8 august 2015, strong winds from typhoon soudelor swayed the main damper by 100 centimetres the largest movement ever recorded by the damper.36  the damper has become such a popular tourist attraction the city contracted sanrio to create a mascot the damper baby four versions of the damper baby gold black silver and red were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei 101 gift shops damper baby with its cute all-ages appeal has become a popular local icon with its own comic book and website.373839  structural faadeedit  taipei 101 during a typhoon  view from the base of the tower looking up  ruyi figure over one of the buildings entrances  shadow of the tower in the late afternoon the adjoining park feature bottom acts as the face of a sundial  feng shui fountain outside taipei 101  taipei 101s characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes short tons.25 the faade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment-resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor this faade system is therefore able to withstand up to 95mm of seismic lateral displacements without damage.40  the original corners of the faade were tested at rwdi in ontario a simulation of a 100-year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second 105 miles per hour wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final designs stairstep corner faade.41 architect cy lee also used extensive faade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these faade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two faade sections among others.42  taipei 101s own roof and faade recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the buildings water needs in july 2011, taipei 101 was certified worlds tallest green building under leed standards.43  symbolismedit  taipei 101 in the skyline  the height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time the new century that arrived as the tower was built and all the new years that follow january 1-01. it symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100, a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology.28  the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune.4445  the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the buildings shape to a stack of take-out boxes as used in western-style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes.46 the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals 1-0-1.28 the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang  curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights.4748 the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians.48 each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei 101 tower stands at least 8m tall.49  at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from 600 to 1000 each evening50 the towers lights display one of seven colours in the spectrum the colors coincide with the days of the week51  day  monday  tuesday  wednesday  thursday  friday  saturday  sunday  color  red  orange  yellow  green  blue  violet  purple  the adjoining taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the buildings occupants the parks design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the buildings wind shear.52  taipei 101, like many of its neighbours shows the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the towers east entrance.53 a ball at the fountains top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the towers rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or chi from a structure and its occupants.5455 placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of chi.5657  interioredit  taipei 101 is the first record-setting skyscraper to be constructed in the 21st century it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for business and recreation.3  the original 2004 fiber-optic and satellite internet connections permitted transfer speeds up to a gigabit per second.26  the double-deck elevators built by the japanese toshiba elevator and building systems corporation set a new record in 2004 with the fastest ascending speeds in the world at 60.6 kilometres per hour 16.83m per second or 1010 mmin,34 the speed of taipei 101s elevators is 34.7 percent faster than the previous record holders of the yokohama landmark tower elevator yokohama japan which reaches speeds of 12.5m per second 28.0mih. taipei 101s elevators sweep visitors from the fifth floor to the 89th-floor observatory in only 37

elevator is NT80million  a 660-tonne tuned mass damper located between the 87th and 91st floors,34 stabilizes the tower against movements caused by high winds.41 the damper can reduce up to 40 percent of the towers movements.6364 the tmd is visible to all visitors on the 87th through 91st floors.34  two restaurants have opened on the 85th floor diamond tonys which offers european-style seafood and

outlets also operate in the adjoining mall the multi-story retail mall adjoining the tower is home to hundreds of fashionable stores restaurants clubs and other attractions the malls interior is modern in design even as it makes use of traditional elements the curled ruyi symbol is a recurring motif inside the mall many features of the interior also observe feng shui traditions.57  floor

during 2003, showing the concrete tower at the top still incomplete the height of the building was still 449.2 meters at the time  planning for taipei 101 began in july 19972 during chen shui-bians term as taipei mayor talks between merchants and city government officials initially centered on a proposal for a 66-story tower to serve as an anchor for new development in taipeis 101 business district planners were considering taking the new structure to a more ambitious height only after an expat suggested it along with many of the other features used in the design of the building it wasnt until the summer of 2001 that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site in the meantime construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of 2000.264  a major earthquake took place in taiwan during 31 march 2002 destroying a construction crane at the rooftop which was at floor number 47. the crane fell down onto the xinyi road beneath the tower crushing several vehicles and causing five deaths two crane operators and three workers who were not properly harnessed however an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction work was able to restart within a week.29  taipei 101s roof was completed three years later on 1 july 2003. ma ying-jeou in his first term as taipei mayor fastened a golden bolt to signify the achievement.3 the formal opening of the tower took place on new years eve 2004. president chen shui-bian taipei mayor ma ying-jeou and legislative speaker wang jin-pyng cut the

by leed standards the structure is already designed to be energy-efficient with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50 percent and recycled water meeting 2030 percent of the buildings needs leed certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT60million estimates show the savings resulting from the modifications would pay for the cost of making them within three years.82 the project was carried out under the guidance of an international team composed of siemens building technologies architect and interior designer steven leach
