2016, it accounts for about 16 of the worlds human population the continent is surrounded by the mediterranean sea to the north both the suez canal and the red sea along the sinai peninsula to the northeast the indian ocean to the southeast and the atlantic ocean to the west the continent includes madagascar and various archipelagos it contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.3  africas average population is the youngest amongst all the continents45 the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.6 algeria is africas largest country by area and nigeria is its largest by population africa particularly central eastern africa is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the hominidae clade apes as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago including sahelanthropus tchadensis australopithecus africanus a afarensis homo erectus h habilis and h ergasterwith the earliest homo sapiens human found in ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.7

sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean Libya.910 this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe see terence for discussion the name is usually connected with hebrew or phoenician afar but a 1981 hypothesis11 has asserted that it stems from the berber ifri ifran in reference to cave dwellers.12 the same word12 may be found in the name of the banu ifran from algeria and tripolitania a berber tribe originally from yafran known as ifrane in northwestern Libya.13  under roman rule carthage became the capital of the province of africa proconsularis which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.14 the latin suffix can sometimes be used to denote a land in celtica from celtae as used by julius caesar the later muslim kingdom of ifriqiya located in modern-day tunisia also preserved a form of the name  according to the romans africa lay to the west of egypt while was used to refer to anatolia and lands to the east a definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer ptolemy ad indicating alexandria along the prime meridian and making the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of expanded with their knowledge  other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name  the 1st-century jewish historian flavius josephus 1.15 asserted that it was named for epher grandson of abraham according to gen 254, whose descendants he claimed had invaded libya  isidore of seville in his 7th-century etymologiae

african origin of modern humans  lucy an australopithecus afarensis skeleton discovered 24 november 1974 in the awash valley of ethiopias afar depression  africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on earth with the human species originating from the continent.1819 during the mid-20th century anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago present fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man such as australopithecus afarensis dated to approximately 3.93.0million years BP,20 paranthropus boisei 2.31.4million years BP21 and homo ergaster 1.9million600,000 years bp have been discovered.2  after the evolution of homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years bp in africa the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.222324 these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50,000 years bp exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red Sea,2526 the strait of gibraltar in Morocco,27 or the isthmus of suez in Egypt.28  other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa southeast africa north africa and the Sahara.29  the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.30 at the end of the ice ages estimated to have been around 10,500 bc the sahara had again become a green fertile valley and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili najjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.31 however the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile around 3500 bc due to a tilt in the earths orbit the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.32 the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements a major climatic recession occurred lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa since this time dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and increasingly during the last 200 years in ethiopia  the domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures it is speculated that by 6000 bc cattle were domesticated in north Africa.33 in the sahara-nile complex people domesticated many animals including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubia  around 4000 bc the saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.34 this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification this in turn decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of west Africa.34  by the first millennium bc ironworking had been introduced in northern africa and quickly spread across the sahara into the northern parts of sub-saharan Africa,35 and by 500 bc metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa although other regions didnt begin ironworking until the early centuries ad copper objects from egypt north africa nubia and ethiopia dating from around 500 bc

rise of literacy in the pharaonic civilization of ancient Egypt.36 one of the worlds earliest and longest-lasting civilizations the egyptian state continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until 343 BC.3738 egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day libya and nubia and according to martin bernal as far north as Crete.39  an independent centre of civilization with trading links to phoenicia was established by phoenicians from tyre on the north-west african coast at Carthage.404142  european exploration of africa began with ancient greeks and romanscitation needed in 332 bc alexander the great was welcomed as a liberator in persian-occupied egypt he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death.43  following the conquest of north africas mediterranean coastline by the roman empire the area was integrated economically and culturally into the roman system roman settlement occurred in modern tunisia and elsewhere along the coast the first roman emperor native to north africa was septimius severus born in leptis magna in present-day libyahis mother was italian roman and his father was Punic.44  christianity spread across these areas at an early date from judaea via egypt and beyond the borders of the roman world into Nubia45 by ad 340 at the latest it had become the state religion of the aksumite empire syro-greek missionaries who arrived by way of the red sea were responsible for this theological development.46  in the early 7th century the newly formed arabian islamic caliphate expanded into egypt and then into north africa in a short while the local berber elite had been integrated into muslim arab tribes when the umayyad capital damascus fell in the 8th century the islamic centre of the mediterranean shifted from syria to qayrawan in north africa islamic north africa had become diverse and a hub for mystics scholars jurists and philosophers during the

africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities49 characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule these included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the san people of southern africa larger more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the bantu-speaking peoples of central southern and eastern africa heavily

sudan in the thirteenth century kanem accepted islam in the eleventh century  in the forested regions of the west african coast independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day nigeria and was ruled by the eze nri the nri kingdom is famous

of oyo once controlled a large number of other yoruba and non-yoruba city-states and kingdoms the fon kingdom of dahomey was one of the non-yoruba domains under oyo control  the almoravids were a berber dynasty from the sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern africa and the iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.51 the banu hilal and banu maqil were a collection of arab bedouin tribes from the arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries their migration resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers where the locals were Arabized,52 and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture under the unifying framework of Islam.53  ruins of great zimbabwe to fifteenth centuries  following the breakup of mali

1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of muslim merchants his successor askia mohammad i made islam the official religion built mosques and brought to gao muslim scholars including al-maghili the founder of an important tradition of sudanic african muslim scholarship.54 by the eleventh century some hausa states such as kano jigawa katsina and gobir had developed into walled towns engaging in trade servicing caravans and the manufacture of goods until the fifteenth century these small states were on the periphery of the major sudanic empires of the era paying tribute to songhai to the west and kanem-borno to the east  1803 cedid atlas showing the africa from the perspective of the ottoman empire the ottomans controlled much of northern africa between the

centuries years the atlantic slave trade took an estimated 712 million slaves to the new World.585960 more than 1 million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.61  in west africa the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities the gradual decline of slave-trading prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america and the british royal navys increasing presence off the west african coast obliged african states to adopt new economies between 1808 and 1860, the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 africans who were aboard.62  slave being

political future of african ethnic groups it was convened by king leopold ii of belgium and attended by the european powers that laid claim to african territories the berlin conference sought to end the european powers scramble for africa by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence they set up the political divisions of the continent by spheres of interest that exist in africa today  independence struggles  imperial rule by europeans would continue until after the conclusion of world war ii when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence independence movements in africa gained momentum following world war ii which left the major european powers weakened in 1951, libya a former italian colony gained independence in 1956,

post-colonial africa  mobutu sese seko zaires longtime dictator embezzled over billion from his country  today africa contains 54 sovereign countries most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of european colonialism since colonialism african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule however few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis and many have instead cycled through a series of coups producing military dictatorships  great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups and graft under these leaders for political gain many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts some of which had been exacerbated or even created by colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations border and

800,000 people were murdered aids in post-colonial africa has also been a prevalent issue  in the 21st century however the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined for instance the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years this has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations mainly from China,71 which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline several african economies are among the worlds fastest growing as of 2016. a significant part of this growth which is sometimes referred to as africa rising can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.72  geography  main article geography of africa  satellite photo of africa the

sub-saharan africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty per day some 50 of the population living in poverty in 1981 million people a figure that rose to 58 in 1996 before dropping to 50 in 2005 million people the average poor person in sub-saharan africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,90 indicating increasing poverty in some areas some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.919293  from 1995 to 2005, africas rate of economic growth increased averaging 5 in 2005. some countries experienced still higher growth rates notably angola sudan and

eastern parts of west africa bordering central africa  the peoples of north africa consist of three main indigenous groups berbers in the northwest egyptians in the northeast and nilo-saharan-speaking peoples in the east the arabs who arrived in the 7th century ad introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa the semitic phoenicians founded carthage and hyksos the indo-iranian alans the indo- european greeks romans and vandals settled in north africa as well significant berber communities remain within morocco and algeria in the 21st century while to a lesser extent berber speakers are also present in some regions of tunisia and Libya.106 the berber-speaking tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa in mauritania there is a small but near-extinct berber community in the north and nigercongo-speaking peoples in the south though in both regions arabic and arab culture predominates in sudan although arabic and arab culture predominate it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke nilo-saharan such as the nubians fur masalit and zaghawa who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants

1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers especially from algeria and morocco million pieds-noirs in north Africa,108 kenya Congo,109 rhodesia mozambique and Angola.110 between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to portugal alone.111 nevertheless white africans remain an important minority in many african states particularly zimbabwe namibia runion and the republic of south Africa.112 the country with the largest white african population is south Africa.113 dutch and british diasporas represent the largest communities of european ancestry on the continent today.114  european colonization also brought sizable groups of asians particularly from the indian subcontinent to british colonies large indian communities are found in south africa and smaller ones are present in kenya tanzania and some other southern and southeast african countries the large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in 1972, though many have since returned the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin often mixed with africans and europeans the malagasy people of madagascar are an austronesian people but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu arab indian and european origins malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as cape coloureds with origins in two or more races and continents during the 20th century small but economically important communities of lebanese and Chinese71 have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa respectively.115  languages  main article languages of africa  map showing the traditional language families represented in africa  afroasiatic  austronesian

uganda and northern tanzania  the niger-congo language family covers much of sub-saharan africa in terms of number of languages it is the largest language family in africa and perhaps the largest in the world  the khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in southern africa by approximately 400,000 people.117 many of the khoisan languages are endangered the khoi and san peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of africa  following the end of colonialism nearly all african countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent although

public sphere such as government commerce education and the media arabic portuguese afrikaans and spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of africa and that are used by

schools.118 leopold ii of belgium attempted to africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.118  obidoh freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern african art.119 according to authors douglas fraser and herbert m cole precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art fraser and cole assert that in igboland some art objects the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.120 author chika okeke-agulu states that racist infrastructure of british imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign africa and modernist art in soweto the west rand administrative board established a cultural section to collect read and review scripts before performances could occur.122 editors f abiola irele and simon gikandi comment that the current identity of african literature had its genesis in the encounter between africa and europe on the other hand mhoze chikowero believes that africans deployed music dance spirituality and other performative cultures to themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies  there is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue african traditional cultures under such movements as the african renaissance led by thabo mbeki afrocentrism led by a group of scholars including molefi asante as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of vodou and other forms of spirituality  visual art and architecture  african art and architecture reflect the diversity of african cultures the regions oldest known beads were made from nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.125 the great pyramid of giza in egypt was the worlds

singing of southern africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous dominated by the music of the democratic republic of congo indigenous musical and dance traditions of africa are maintained by oral traditions and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of north africa and southern africa arab influences are visible in north african music and dance and in southern africa western influences are apparent due to colonization  sports  fifty-four african countries have football teams in the confederation of african football egypt has won the african cup seven times
