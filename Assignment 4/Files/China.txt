journal by portuguese explorer duarte Barbosa.l31 the portuguese word was derived from persian chn and some traced it further to sanskrit cna the earliest known example of cna being used to refer to china dates from ad 150.33 although indian writers may not have been aware of chinas existence prior to the first century BC,34 the word cna appears in mahbhrata as well as in the laws of Manu.35 in 1655, martino martini suggested that the word china is derived from the name of the qin dynasty BC,36 a proposal supported by many later scholars,373839 although there are also a number of alternative suggestions.3540  the official name of the modern state is the republic of china pinyin zhnghu rnmn gnghgu the shorter form is zhnggu from zhng or and gu nation-state,26m a term which developed under the zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesnen it was then applied to the area around luoyi luoyang during the eastern zhou and then to chinas central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.42 it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the huaxia tribes from perceived and was the source of the english name Kingdom.4445 a more literary or inclusive name alluding to the of chinese civilization is zhnghu it developed during the wei and jin dynasties as a contraction of central state of the Huaxia.42 before the prcs establishment the

that early hominids inhabited china between 2.24 million and 250,000 years ago.50 the hominid fossils of peking man a homo erectus who used fire,51 were discovered in a cave at zhoukoudian near beijing they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago.52 the fossilized teeth of homo sapiens to 125,00080,000 years ago have been discovered in fuyan cave in dao county Hunan.53 chinese proto-writing existed in jiahu around 7000BCE,54 damaidi around 6000BCE,55 dadiwan from 58005400BCE, and banpo dating from the 5th millenniumbce some scholars have suggested that the jiahu symbols millenniumbce constituted the earliest chinese writing system.54  early dynastic rule  further information dynasties in chinese history  yinxu the ruins of the capital of the late shang dynasty centurybce  according to chinese tradition the first dynasty was the xia which emerged around 2100BCE.56 the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 1959.57 it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period.58 the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records.59 the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th centuryBCE.60 their oracle bone script c.1500BCE6162 represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found,63 and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese characters.64  the shang were conquered by the zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuriesbce though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year spring and autumn period only occasionally deferring to the zhou king by the time of the warring states period of the 5th3rd centuriesbce there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now china each with its own king ministry and army  imperial china  chinas first emperor qin shi huang is famed for having united the warring states walls to form the great wall of china most of the present structure however dates to the ming dynasty  classical gardens of suzhou  the terracotta army discovered outside the mausoleum of the first qin emperor now xian  the warring states period ended in 221BCE after the state of qin conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified chinese state king zheng of qin proclaimed himself the first emperor pinyin sh hungd of the qin dynasty he enacted qins legalist reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of chinese characters measurements road widths cart axles length and currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and Vietnam.65 the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperors death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.6667  following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burnedo the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206BCE and CE220, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han Chinese.6667 the han expanded the empires territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.69 despite the hans initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qins legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successors.70  after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed,71 whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in 581. the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war with korea provoked widespread unrest.7273  a detail from along the river during the qingming festival a 12th-century painting showing everyday life in the song dynastys capital bianjing kaifeng  under the succeeding tang and song dynasties chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age.74 the tang empire returned control of the western regions and the silk Road,75 and made the capital changan a cosmopolitan urban center however it was devastated and weakened by the an shi rebellion in the 8th century.76 in 907, the tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable the song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the song and khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.77 between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the Tang,78 and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.7980 however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the jurchen jin dynasty in 1127, emperor huizong of song and the capital bianjing were captured during the jinsong wars the remnants of the song retreated to southern China.81  the 13th century brought the mongol conquest of china in 1271, the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in 1279. before the mongol invasion the population of song china was 120 million citizens this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.82 a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that zheng he led treasure voyages throughout the world reaching as far as Africa.83  in the early years of the ming dynasty chinas capital was moved from nanjing to beijing with the budding of capitalism philosophers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo-confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.84 the scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against japanese invasions of korea and manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury.85  in 1644, beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew lis short-lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty  end of dynastic rule  a 19th-century depiction of the taiping rebellion  the qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of china its conquest of the ming cost 25 million lives and the economy of china shrank drastically.86 after the southern ming ended the further conquest of the dzungar khanate added mongolia tibet and xinjiang to the empire.87 the centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti-qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce the haijin ban and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing social and technological stagnation.8889 in the mid-19th century the dynasty experienced western imperialism in the opium wars with britain and france china was forced to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede hong kong to the British90 under the 1842 treaty of nanking the first of the unequal treaties the first sino-japanese war resulted in qing chinas loss of influence in the korean peninsula as well as the cession of taiwan to Japan.91  the eight-nation alliance invaded china to defeat the anti-foreign boxers and their qing backers  the qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the failed taiping rebellion that ravaged southern china in the 1850s and 1860s and the dungan revolt in the northwest the initial success of the self-strengthening movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.  in the 19th century the great chinese diaspora began losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the northern chinese famine of 187679, in which between 9 and 13 million people died.92 the guangxu emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the empress dowager cixi the ill-fated anti-foreign boxer rebellion of 18991901 further weakened the dynasty although cixi sponsored a program of reforms the xinhai revolution of 191112 brought an end to the qing dynasty and established the republic of china  republic of china

of the republic of china  chiang kai-shek and mao zedong toasting together in 1946 following the end of world war ii  on 1 january 1912, the republic of china was established and sun yat-sen of the kuomintang kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president.93 however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself emperor of china in the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own beiyang army he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic.94  after yuan shikais death in 1916, china was politically fragmented its beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory.9596 in the late 1920s, the kuomintang under chiang kai-shek the then principal of the republic of china military academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings known collectively as the northern Expedition.9798 the kuomintang moved the nations capital to nanjing and implemented tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat-sens san-min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state.99100 the political division in china made it difficult for chiang to battle the communist peoples liberation army against whom the kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the chinese civil war this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the pla retreated in the long march until japanese aggression and the 1936 xian incident forced chiang to confront imperial Japan.101  the second sino-japanese war a theater of world war ii forced an uneasy alliance between the kuomintang and the pla japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population in all as many as 20 million chinese civilians died.102 an estimated 200,000 chinese were massacred in the city of nanjing alone during the japanese occupation.103 during the war china along with the uk the us and the soviet union were referred to as of the powerful104 and were recognized as the allied four in the declaration by united Nations.105106 along with the other three great powers china was one of the four major allies of world war ii and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.107108 after the surrender of japan in 1945, taiwan including the pescadores was returned to chinese control china emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained the continued distrust between the kuomintang and the communists led to the resumption of civil war constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the roc constitution were never implemented in mainland China.109  peoples republic of china  main article history of the peoples republic of china  history of the peoples  republic of china  19491976  mao era  revolution  korean war  mass killings of

mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the rocs territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands on 21 september 1949, communist party chairman mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the peoples republic of China.789 this was followed by a mass celebration in tiananmen square on october 1 which became the new countrys first national day in 1950, the peoples liberation army succeeded in capturing hainan from the ROC110 and incorporating Tibet.111 however remaining kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western china throughout the 1950s.112 in modern us history studies the founding of prc china is often termed as loss of china as reflected in us state policy documents of the time which thinkers such as chomsky call the beginning of McCarthyism.113  the regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform which saw between 1 and 2 million landlords executed.114 under its leadership china developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.115 the chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million.116 however the great leap forward a large-scale economic and social reform project resulted in an estimated 45million deaths between 1958 and 1961, mostly from starvation.117 in 1966, mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until maos death in 1976. in october 1971, the prc replaced the republic of china in the united nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the security Council.118  after maos death the gang of four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted significant economic reforms the communist party loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of private land leases this marked chinas transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment.119 china adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982. in 1989, the violent suppression of student protests in tiananmen square brought condemnation and sanctions against the chinese government from various countries.120  jiang zemin li peng and zhu rongji led the nation in the 1990s. under their administration chinas economic performance pulled an estimated 150million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2.121122 the country formally joined the world trade organization in 2001, and maintained its high rate of economic growth under hu jintao and wen jiabaos leadership in the 2000s. however rapid growth also severely impacted the countrys resources and environment,123124 and caused major social displacement.125126 living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late-2000s recession but centralized political control remained tight.127  preparations for a decadal communist party leadership change in 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals.128 during chinas 18th national communist party congress in november 2012, hu jintao was replaced as general secretary of the communist party by xi Jinping.129130 under xi the chinese government began large-scale efforts to reform its economy,131132 which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth.133134135136 the xili administration also announced major reforms to the one-child policy and prison system.137  geography  main article geography of china  a composite satellite image showing the topography of china  longsheng rice terrace in guangxi  the li river in guangxi  kppen climate

countries.203 along with brazil russia india and south africa china is a member of the brics group of emerging major economies and hosted the groups third official summit at sanya hainan in april

official ties with the government of the republic of china chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,205 especially in the matter of armament sales.206  much of current chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on premier zhou enlais five principles of peaceful coexistence and is also driven by the concept of without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.207 this policy may have led china to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by western nations such as zimbabwe north korea and Iran.208 china has a close economic and military relationship with Russia,209 and the two states often vote in unison in the un security

part of its territory it regards the island of taiwan as its taiwan province kinmen and matsu as a part of fujian province and islands the roc controls in the south china sea as a part of hainan province and guangdong province these claims are controversial because of the complicated cross-strait relations with the prc treating the one-china policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles.225  in addition to taiwan china is also involved in other international territorial disputes since the 1990s, china has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with india and an undefined border with bhutan china is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the east and south

hailed as a potential new superpower with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century.24229 others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt chinas growth as the century progresses.230231

social controls have been significantly relaxed in china since the 1970s, political freedom is still tightly restricted the constitution of the peoples republic of china states that the rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights however in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.233234 although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling communist party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most notably on the Internet,235236 are routinely used to prevent collective action.237 in 2005, reporters without borders ranked china 159th out of 167 states in its annual world press freedom index indicating a very low level of press freedom.238 in 2014, china ranked 175th out of 180 countries.239  rural migrants to chinas cities often find themselves treated as second-class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits.240241 property rights are often poorly protected,240 and taxation disproportionately affects poorer

violations such as detention without trial forced abortions,244 forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights,185245 and excessive use of the death penalty.246247 the government has suppressed popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to stability as was the case with the tiananmen square protests of 1989.  falun gong was first taught publicly in 1992. in 1999, when there were 70 million practitioners,248 the persecution of falun gong began resulting in mass arrests extralegal detention and reports of torture and deaths in custody.249250 the chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in tibet and xinjiang including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression.251252  the chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a countrys present level of economic development.253 it emphasizes the rise in the chinese standard of living literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s, as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial yangtze river floods.253254255 furthermore some chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization although others remain more conservative.256 some major reform efforts have been conducted for an instance in november 2013, the government announced plans to relax the one-child policy and abolish the much-criticized re-education through labour program,137 though human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic.249 during the 2000s and early 2010s, the chinese government was increasingly tolerant of ngos that offer practical efficient solutions to social problems but such sector activity remained heavily regulated.257258  military  main
