reflect recent events or newly available information 2014  the worlds energy consumption data1  total primary consumption in the world by fuel  world energy consumption is the total energy used by the entire human civilization typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanitys endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country it does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanitys socio-economic-political sphere  institutions such as the international energy agency the us energy information administration and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions  closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total primary energy supply which on a global level is the sum of energy production minus storage changes since changes of energy storage over the year are minor tpes values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption however tpes ignores conversion efficiency overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency coal gas and nuclear and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms photovoltaic or hydroelectricity the iea estimates that in 2013, total primary energy supply was 1.575 1017 wh 157.5 pwh 5.67 1020 joules or 13,541 Mtoe.2 from 20002012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydropower and renewable energy renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period the demand for nuclear energy decreased in part due to nuclear disasters three mile island 1979, chernobyl 1986, and fukushima 2011.13  in 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion usd or about 10 of the world gross domestic product europe spends close to one-quarter of the worlds energy expenditures north america close to 20, and japan 6.4  contents  1 overview  1.1 energy supply consumption and

energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers for instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the worlds primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity  in 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481terawatt-hour or 13,541Mtoe, while the world final energy consumption was 109,613TWh or about 29.5 less than the total supply.9 world final energy consumption includes products as lubricants asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel this non-energy use amounted to 9,404 twh mtoe in 2012.11  by the end of 2014, the total installed global power generating capacity is nearly 6.142 tw mw which does not include the dg sets not connected to local electricity grids.12 in 2014, world energy consumption for electricity generation was coal 40.8, natural gas 21.6, nuclear 10.6, hydro 16.4, wind geothermal biomass etc 6.3 and oil 4.3. coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels for generating electricity the worlds electricity consumption was 18,608TWhcitation needed in 2012. this figure is about 18 smaller than the generated electricity due to grid losses storage losses and self-consumption from power plants generation cogeneration power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes  2014 world electricity generation twh by source

resources for 2013, estimated world energy consumption was 5.67 1020 joules or 157,481TWh. according to the iea the total world energy consumption was 143,851 twh in 2008, 133,602TWh in 2005, 117,687TWh in 2000, and 102,569TWh in 1990. total world electricity consumption was 19,504TWh in 2013, 16,503TWh in 2008, 15,105TWh in 2005, and 12,116TWh in 2000.2 in 2012 approximately 22 of world energy was consumed in north america 5 was consumed south and central america 23 was consumed in europe and eurasia 3 was consumed in africa and 40 was consumed in the asia pacific region.1  recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national energy action plans such as the eu 2009 renewable energy directive to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas.314 one such initiative was the united nations development programmes world energy assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.3 from 20002012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil during this period oil coal and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy the following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.1  trendsedit  world primary energy consumption in quadrillion Btu15  energy intensity of different economies the graph shows the ratio between energy usage and gdp for selected countries gdp is based on 2004 purchasing power parity and 2000 dollars adjusted for inflation.16  gdp and energy consumption in japan 19582000 the data shows the correlation between gdp and energy use however it also shows that this link can be broken after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 the energy use stagnated while japans gdp continued to grow after 1985, under the influence of the then much cheaper oil energy use resumed its historical relation to GDP.17  the energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2 in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth for several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.18  according to iea data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27. regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008 the middle east increased by 170, china by 146, india by 91, africa by 70, latin america by 66, the usa by 20, the EU-27 block by 7, and world overall grew by 39.  in 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours or 474 exajoules in 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 twh  energy consumption in the G20 increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. in 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world gdp by 0.6 in 2009.21  this evolution is the result of two contrasting trends energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in asia conversely in oecd consumption was severely cut by 4.7 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels in north america europe and the cis consumptions shrank by 4.5, 5 and 8.5 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity china became the worlds largest energy consumer of the total since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009 from 4 in 2008. oil remained the largest energy source despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time coal posted a growing role in the worlds energy consumption in 2009, it accounted for 27 of the total  most energy is used in the country of origin since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials in 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was oil 50 gas 25 and hard coal 14  most of the worlds high energy resources are from the conversion of the suns rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy some is directly or indirectly usable for example via solar pvthermal wind hydro- or wave power the total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter solar constant though it fluctuates by about 6.9 during the year due to the earths varying distance from the sun this value after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the earth is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet about half 89,000TW, reaches the earths surface.23  the estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4 yottajoule or 4 1023 joules and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium exceeding 2.5YJ. fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3YJ if estimates of reserves of methane clathrates are accurate and become technically extractable the total power flux from the sun intercepting the earth is 5.5YJ per year though not all of this is available for human consumption the iea estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of trillion and policy frameworks.24  according to iea the goal of limiting warming to 2C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes if action is not taken before 2017, CO2 emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix supported by billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30 on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.25  regional energy use twh and

nations have signed limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius thought to be a risk by the sei is now doubtful  to limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees celsius rise would demand a 75 decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050.28 across 40 years this averages to a 2 decrease every year in 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem hypothetically according to robert engelman institute in order to prevent collapse human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population  greenhouse gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides nitrous oxides and particulate matter are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.30 biomass combustion is a major contributor.303132 in addition to producing air pollution like fossil fuel combustion most biomass has high CO2

coaledit  main articles coal and list of countries by coal production  in 2000, china accounted for 28 of world coal consumption other asia consumed 19, north america 25 and the eu 14. the single greatest coal-consuming country is china its share of the world coal production was 28 in 2000 and rose to 48 in 2009. in contrast to chinas increase in coal consumption world coal use increased 48 from 2000 to 2009. in practice the majority of this growth occurred in china and the rest in other Asia.34 chinas energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector the majority of which comes from coal consumption.35  world annual coal production increased 1,905Mt or 32 in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70 was in china and 8 in india coal production was in 2011 7,783Mt, and 2009 6,903Mt, equal to 12.7 production increase in two years.36  if production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years this is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world according to james hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO2 emissions from coal.37 indonesia and australia exported together 57.1 of the world coal export in 2011. china japan

dominant fuel during the twentieth century the growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 us dollars per barrel there was a shift away from oil.41 coal natural gas and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency in the us the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon japan which bore the brunt of the oil shocks made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.42 from 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased from 2003 to 2008, coal

renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources that are not significantly depleted by their use such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat.50 renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas electricity generation hot waterspace heating motor fuels and rural energy services.51  based on REN21s 2014 report renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively this energy consumption is divided as 9 coming from traditional biomass 4.2 as heat energy 3.8 hydro electricity and 2 electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US214 billion in 2013, with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels.52 renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits.53 in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power.54 at the national level at least 30 nations around the

germany in 2010.7274 as of 2011, 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.74 continuing strong growth by 2016 wind generated 3 of global power annually.75  solaredit  main articles solar energy solar power and solar power by country  solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies solar energy technologies include solar heating solar photovoltaics concentrated solar power and solar architecture which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces the international energy agency projected that solar power could provide third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO2 emissions would be reduced to very low levels.76 solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air from 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3 of global energy.77  geothermaledit  main articles geothermal energy and geothermal power  geothermal energy is used commercially in over 70 countries.78 in 2004, 200 petajoules of electricity was generated from geothermal resources and an additional 270 petajoules of geothermal energy was used directly mostly for space heating in 2007, the world had a global capacity for 701010000000000000010GW of electricity generation and an additional 701028000000000000028GW of direct heating including extraction by geothermal heat pumps.7980 heat pumps are small and widely distributed so estimates of their total capacity are uncertain and range up to 7011100000000000000100GW.78  bio energyedit  main articles biomass biogas and biofuel  until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply electricity produced from biomass sources was estimated at 44GW for 2005. biomass electricity generation increased by over 100 in germany hungary the netherlands poland and spain a further 220GW was used for heating 2004, bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264GW. the use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded.79 world production of bioethanol increased by 8 in 2005 to reach 33 gigalitres with most of the increase in the united states bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil.79 biodiesel increased by 85 to 3.9 gigalitres making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. over 50 is produced in Germany.79  by countryedit  main article list of renewable energy topics by country  see also energy by country

countries such as japan and germany with an energy consumption rate of 6kW per person and the united states with an energy consumption rate of 11.4kW per person in developing countries particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as india the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7kW. bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2kW per person  the us consumes 25 of the worlds energy with a share of global gdp at 22 and a share of the world population at 4.59.81 the most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in china which has been growing at 5.5 per year over the last 25 years its population of 1.3 billion people of the world population81 is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6kW per person  one measurement of efficiency is energy
