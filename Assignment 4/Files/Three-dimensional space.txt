parameters are required to determine the position of an element point this is the informal meaning of the term dimension  in physics and mathematics a sequence of n numbers can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space when n 3, the set of all such locations is called three-dimensional euclidean space it is commonly represented by the symbol 3. this serves as a three-parameter model of the physical universe is the spatial part without considering time in which all known matter exists however this space is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called 3-manifolds. in this classical example when the three values refer to measurements in different directions any three directions can be chosen provided that vectors in these directions do not all lie in the same 2-space furthermore in this case these three values can be labeled by any combination of three chosen from the terms width height depth and breadth  contents  1 in euclidean geometry  1.1

cartesian geometry describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates three coordinate axes are given each perpendicular to the other two at the origin the point at which they cross they are usually labeled x y and z relative to these axes the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of real numbers each number giving the distance of that point from the origin measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes.1  other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates though there are an infinite number of possible methods see euclidean space  below are images of the above-mentioned systems  cartesian coordinate system  cylindrical coordinate system  spherical coordinate system  lines and planesedit  two distinct points always determine a line three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane four distinct points can either be collinear coplanar or determine the entire space  two distinct lines can either intersect be parallel or be skew two parallel lines or two intersecting lines lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common plane  two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel not meet three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common in the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallel  a line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane in the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given line  a hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space the hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces that is the planes in terms of cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear equation so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations a line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersection  varignons theorem states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in 3 form a parallelogram and so are coplanar  spheres and ballsedit  main article sphere  a two-dimensional perspective projection of a sphere  a sphere in 3-space called a 2-sphere because it is a 2-dimensional object consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance r from a central point p the solid enclosed by the sphere is called a ball more precisely a 3-ball. the volume of the ball is given by   another type of sphere arises from a 4-ball, whose three-dimensional surface is the 3-sphere points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space 4. if a point has coordinates px y z w then x2 y2 z2 w2 1 characterizes those points on the unit 3-sphere centered at the origin  polytopesedit  main article polyhedron  in three dimensions there are nine regular polytopes the five convex platonic solids and the four nonconvex kepler-poinsot polyhedra  regular polytopes in three dimensions  class  platonic solids  kepler-poinsot polyhedra  symmetry  td

about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a surface of revolution the plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface a section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular to the axis is a circle  simple examples occur when the generatrix is a line if the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular cone with vertex the point of intersection however if the generatrix and axis are parallel the surface of revolution is a circular cylinder  quadric surfacesedit  main article quadric surface  in analogy with the conic sections the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namely  where a b c f g h j k l and m are real numbers and not all of a b c f g and h are zero is called a quadric surface.2  there are six types of non-degenerate quadric surfaces  ellipsoid  hyperboloid of one sheet  hyperboloid of two sheets  elliptic cone  elliptic paraboloid  hyperbolic paraboloid  the degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set a single point a single line a single plane a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder surface consisting of a non-degenerate conic section in a plane and all the lines of 3 through that conic that are normal to elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as well  both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines in fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family.3 each family is called a regulus  in linear algebraedit  another way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in linear algebra where the idea of independence is crucial space has three dimensions because the length of a box is independent of its width or breadth in the technical language of linear algebra space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent vectors  dot product angle and lengthedit  main article dot product  a vector can be pictured as an arrow its magnitude is its length and its direction is the direction the arrow points a vector in 3 can be represented by an ordered triple of real numbers these numbers are called the components of the vector  the dot product of two vectors a A2, A3 and b B2, B3 is defined as4  the magnitude of a vector a is denoted by the dot product of a vector a A2, A3 with itself is  which gives  the formula for the euclidean length of the vector  without reference to the components of the vectors the dot product of two non-zero euclidean vectors a and b is given by5  where is the angle between a and b  cross productedit  main article cross product  the cross product or vector product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space and is denoted by the symbol the cross product a b of the vectors a and b is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them it has many applications in mathematics physics and engineering  the space and product form an algebra over a field which is neither commutative nor associative but is a lie algebra with the cross product being the lie bracket  one can in n dimensions take the product of n 1 vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensions.6  the cross-product in respect to a right-handed coordinate system  in calculusedit  main article vector calculus  gradient divergence and curledit  in a rectangular coordinate system the gradient is given by  the divergence of a continuously differentiable vector field f u i v j w k is equal to the scalar-valued function  expanded in cartesian coordinates del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations the curl f is for f composed of fy fz  where i j and k are the unit vectors for the x- y- and z-axes respectively this expands as follows7  line integrals surface integrals and volume integralsedit  for some scalar field f u rn r the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve c u is defined as  where r b c is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c and  for a vector field f u rn rn the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve c u in the direction of r is defined as  where is the dot product and r b c is a bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c  a surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces it can be thought of as the double integral analog of the line integral to find an explicit formula for the surface integral we need to parameterize the surface of interest s by considering a system of curvilinear coordinates on s like the latitude and longitude on a sphere let such a parameterization be xs t where t varies in some region t in the plane then the surface integral is given by  where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of xs t and is known as the surface element given a vector field v on s that is a function that assigns to each x in s a vector vx the surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field the result is a vector  a volume integral refers to an integral over a 3-dimensional domain  it can also mean a triple integral within a region d in R3 of a function and is usually written as  fundamental theorem of line integralsedit  main article fundamental theorem of line integrals  the fundamental theorem of line integrals says that a line integral through a gradient field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve  let then  stokes theoremedit  main article stokes theorem  stokes theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field f over a surface in euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary  divergence theoremedit  main article divergence theorem  suppose v is a subset of the case of n 3, v represents a volume in 3D space which is compact and has a piecewise smooth boundary s indicated with v s if f is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of v then the divergence theorem says8  the left side is a volume integral over the volume v the right side is the surface integral over the boundary of the volume v the closed manifold v is quite generally the boundary of v oriented by outward-pointing normals and n is the outward pointing unit normal field of the boundary v may be used as a shorthand for nds  in topologyedit  three-dimensional space has a number of topological properties that distinguish it from spaces of other dimension numbers for example at least three dimensions are required to tie a knot in a piece of string.9  with the space the topologists locally model all other 3-manifolds.  see alsoedit  dimensional analysis  distance from a point to a plane  skew lines distance
