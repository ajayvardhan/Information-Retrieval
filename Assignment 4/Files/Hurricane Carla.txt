saffirsimpson scale  as early as September1, a tropical disturbance an area of convective activity was observed tracking westward across the caribbean sea within the intertropical convergence zone around that time an anticyclone was situated over the western caribbean sea at the upper-tropospheric levels surface charts indicate that a low-level circulation was developing early on September3.2 thus it is estimated that a tropical depression a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than 39mph developed about 175 miles northwest of barranquilla colombia at 1200UTC.3 initially the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data at san andrs winds shifted west at about 12mph while barometric pressures dropped to 1,007mbar the weather bureau office in miami florida issued its first bulletin at 1600UTC on September4, while the depression was centered about 250 miles east-southeast of cabo gracias a dios Nicaragua.2  it is estimated that sustained winds reached 45mph at 1200UTC on September5,4 thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named carla while located just northeast of cabo gracias a Dios.3 a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that carla was continuing to intensify with surface winds of 50mph radars reported an unusually large tropical cyclone with convective bands extending about 520 miles outward from the center around 0000UTC on September6, carla passed near swan island which reported a barometric pressure of about 995mbar and wind gusts of 60mph from the southwest.4 based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100UTC on September6 namely a barometric pressure of 982mbar a bulletin issued by the weather bureau an hour later indicated that the

quintana roo mexico use of the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale which was developed in 1971, was not in effect shortly thereafter carla crossed the yucatn channel and entered the gulf of mexico a

peninsula thus carla was the third major hurricane of the season carla was upgraded to a Category4 hurricane early on September10, while approaching the gulf coast of the united states at 0000UTC on September11, carla strengthened into a Category5 while located in the northwestern gulf of mexico six hours later the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 175mph  although it weakened
