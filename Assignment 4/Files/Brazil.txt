main article name of brazil  it is likely that the word comes from the portuguese word for brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast.25 in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology like an ember formed from latin brasa and the suffix or as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.27 throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods.28  the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the of the holy cross da santa Cruz,29 but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the of brazil do brasil on account of the brazilwood trade.30 the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name some early sailors called it the of Parrots.31  in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning of the palm trees.32  history  main articles history of brazil and timeline of brazilian history  pre-cabraline era  main article history of brazil precolonial history  megaliths in the solstice archaeological park in amap erected between 500 and 2000 years ago probably to carry out astronomical observations  some of the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.3334 the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago bc the pottery was found near santarm and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture.35  around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,36 mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups the tupis guaranis gs and arawaks the tup people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambs and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups.37  before the arrival of the europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs.38 these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war.3940 while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions.38 slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.41  portuguese colonization  main article colonial brazil  representation of the landing of pedro lvares cabral in porto seguro 1500.  the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500, with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro lvares Cabral.42 the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupiguarani family and fought among themselves.43 though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when king dom jooiii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of Brazil.4445  however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south America.4546 in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.47484950 by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazils most important exportation product,4351 and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western Africa52 only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import,5354 to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar.5556  painting showing the arrest of tiradentes he was sentenced to death for his involvement in the best known movement for independence in colonial brazil  by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline,57 and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colonys economy fostering a brazilian gold Rush58 which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world.59 this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.60  portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders.6162 in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s, in maranho during the 1610s, and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutchportuguese war after the end of iberian Union.63  the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugals wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of Palmares,64 and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas Conspiracy.65  united kingdom with portugal  main article united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves  the acclamation of king joo vi of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves in rio de janeiro 6 february 1818  in late 1807, spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal causing prince regent joo in the name of queen maria i to move the royal court from lisbon to Brazil.66 there they established some of brazils first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges,67 and its national bank additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations in 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french Guiana.68  with the end of the peninsular war in 1814, the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joo return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the past six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.69 however such a ploy didnt last long since the leadership in portugal resentful of the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820, and also groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as demonstrated by the 1817 pernambucan Revolt.69 in 1821, as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,70 d joo vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore oath to the new constitution leaving his son prince pedro de alcntara as regent of the kingdom of Brazil.71  independent empire  main articles independence of brazil and empire of brazil  declaration of the brazilian independence by prince pedro emperor pedroi on 7 september 1822.  tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased and the portuguese cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution tried to re-establish brazil as a colony.72 the brazilians refused to yield and prince pedro decided to stand with them declaring the countrys independence from portugal on 7 september 1822.73 a month later prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil with the royal title of dom pedroi resulting in the foundation of the empire of Brazil.74  the brazilian war of independence which had already begun along this process spread through northern northeastern regions and in cisplatina province.75 with the last portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 march 1824,76 portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825.77  on 7 april 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession,78 as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi pedroi went to portugal to reclaim his daughters crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir thus became the empires second monarch with the royal title of dom PedroII.79  pedro ii emperor of brazil between 1831 and 1889.  as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national Assembly.80 in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place as the cabanagem in gro-par the mal revolt in salvador da bahia the balaiada the sabinada and the ragamuffin war beginning in rio grande do sul and supported by giuseppe garibaldi these emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state.81 this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt in pernambuco was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841.82  during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,83 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished.84  the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for Uruguay,85 brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedroii these were the platine war the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war the largest war effort in brazilian history.8687  on 15 november 1889, worn out by years of economic stagnation in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.88  early republic  main articles first brazilian republic estado novo and second brazilian republic  proclamation of the republic 1893, oil on canvas by benedito calixto  the republican government was little more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.89 in 1894, following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the republican civilians rose to power.909192  if in relation to its foreign policy the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,93 only broken by the acre war and its involvement in world war i followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of Nations97 internally from the crisis of Encilhamento9899100 and the armada Revolts,101 a prolonged cycle of financial political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions both civilian102103104 and military.105106107  little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate getlio vargas supported by most of the military successfully led the october 1930s Coup.108109 vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed the congress extinguished the constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with their own supporters.110111  in half of the first 100 years

1988 in his hands  in the 1930s, three failed attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred the first was the constitutionalist revolt in 1932 led by the paulista oligarchy the second was a communist uprising in november 1935, and the last one a putsch attempt by the local fascists in may 1938.112113114 the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive the 1937 coup dtat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election installed vargas as a dictator and began the estado novo era noted for government brutality and censorship of the press.115  the foreign policy during vargas years was marked by the antecedents and occurrence of world war ii having brazil remained neutral until august 1942, when the country entered on the allied side,116117 after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy in the context of the strategic dispute over the south Atlantic.118 in addition to its participation in the battle of the atlantic brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the italian campaign.119  with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargass position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy being by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years earlier.120 vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950.121122  contemporary era  main articles brazilian military government and history of brazil since 1985  several brief interim governments followed vargass suicide.123 juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.124 the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,125 but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of braslia inaugurated in 1960.126 his successor jnio quadros resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.127 his vice-president joo goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition128 and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime.129  the new regime was intended to be transitory130 but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968.131 oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society,132133 inside and outside the country through the infamous Condor.134135 despite its brutality like other totalitarian regimes due to an economic boom known as an miracle the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.136  slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas,137 plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and Golbery.138 with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979, brazil began its slow return to democracy which was completed during the 1980s.82  civilians returned to power in 1985 when jos sarney assumed the presidency becoming unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime.139 sarneys unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown fernando collor subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992.140  collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso minister of finance in 1994, cardoso produced a highly successful plano Real,141 that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy,142143 leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998.144  the peaceful transition of power from cardoso to his main opposition leader luiz incio lula da silva in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, was seen as proof that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability.145146 however sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption police brutality inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service numerous peaceful protests erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff who succeeded lula in the in 2010.147148 enhanced by a political and economic crises with evidence of involvement by politicians from all the primary political parties in several bribery and tax evasion schemes,149150 with large street protests for and against her,151 rousseff was impeached by the brazilian congress in 2016.5152 in 2017, the

equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.160 many regions have starkly different microclimates.161162  an equatorial climate characterizes much of northern brazil there is no real dry season but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.160 temperatures average 25C with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.161  over central brazil rainfall is more seasonal characteristic of a savanna climate.161 this region is as extensive as the amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.160 in the interior northeast seasonal rainfall is even more extreme the semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres of rain,163 most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year164 and occasionally less than this creating long periods of drought.161 brazils 187778 grande seca drought the worst in brazils history,165 caused approximately half a million deaths.166 a similarly devastating drought
