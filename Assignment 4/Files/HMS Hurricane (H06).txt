long tons at standard load and 1,883 long tons at deep load the ship had an overall length of 323 feet a beam of 33 feet and a draught of 12feet 5inches she was powered by parsons geared steam turbines driving two shafts which developed a total of 34,000 shaft horsepower and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots 41mph. steam for the turbines was provided by three admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers hurricane carried a maximum of 470 long tons of fuel oil giving her a range of 5,530 nautical miles 6,360mi at 15 knots 17mph.2 the ships complement was 152 officers and men.3  the vessel was designed for four 4.7-inch mk ix guns in single mounts designated and from front to rear but gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added for anti-aircraft defence hurricane had two quadruple mark i mounts for the 0.5inch vickers mark iii machine gun she was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes.2 one depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting-out the ships load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well.45 she was fitted with an asdic set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.6  wartime modificationsedit  little data on hurricanes modifications during the war has survived although it is known that she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder aa gun by october 1940.7 the ships short-range aa armament may have been augmented by two oerlikon 20mm guns on the wings of the ships bridge and the machine gun mounts may have also been replaced by a pair of oerlikons the ships director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge may have been removed in exchange for a type 271 target indication radar a type 286 short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted midway through the war the ship probably also received a hfdf radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast.3  serviceedit  japura was ordered by brazil on 6 december 1937 from vickers-armstrongs barrow-in-furness the ship was laid down on 3 june 1938 and she was purchased by the british on 5 september 1939 after the beginning of world war ii renamed hms hurricane the ship was launched on 29 september and commissioned on 21 june 1940.8 she was assigned to the 9th destroyer flotilla of the home fleet upon commissioning until new construction replaced the losses suffered over the previous few months hurricane then began escorting convoys and conducting anti-submarine patrols until may 1941. on 17 september the ship rescued survivors of city of benares a small passenger ship evacuating 90 children from the united kingdom to canada and the freighter Marina.9 she rescued 451 survivors from the passenger-cargo liner city of nagpur and landed them at greenock scotland on 1 may 1941.910  hurricane was bombed and sunk in a german air raid on liverpool during the night of 78 may 1941. she was struck by a bomb that passed through the hull and detonated underneath her the explosion blew a large hole in her bottom and flooded her engine room and oil tanks the ships structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and hurricane was moved to bidston dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour no one was killed in the attack although a few crewmen received minor injuries.9  the ship was repaired and returned to service in january 1942 as flotilla leader of escort group B1 assigned to the mid-ocean escort force hurricane remained as the leader for the next two years.9 whilst escorting convoy os 62KMS 36, the ship was hit by an acoustic T5 torpedo fired by the german submarineU-415 on the evening of 24 december 1943.11 the torpedo homed in on the ships propeller noises and blew off 30 feet of her stern the explosion killed three and wounded nine of her crew and rendered her unable to move the following morning she was scuttled by the destroyer watchman at 4510N 2205W 45.167N 22.083W 45.167  notesedit  whitley p 112  a b whitley p 109  a b lenton p 163  english p 141  friedman p 226  brown
