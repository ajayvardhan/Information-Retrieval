long march family  from long march rocket  a long march rocket chinese traditional chinese pinyin chngzhng xli ynzi hujin or changzheng rocket in chinese pinyin is any rocket in a family of expendable launch systems operated by the peoples republic of china development and design falls under the auspices of the china academy of launch vehicle technology in english the rockets are abbreviated as lm- for export and cz- within china as zheng means march in chinese pinyin the rockets are named after the long march of chinese communist history  contents  1 history  2 payloads  3 propellants  4

 long march 3B launch  main article list of long march launches  china launched its first satellite known as dong fang hong 1 east is red 1, into earth orbit on its long march space rocket on april 24, 1970, becoming the fifth nation to achieve independent launch capability early launches had an inconsistent record focusing on launching of chinese satellites  starting in 1990, the long march rocket entered the international market however several setbacks occurred during the early 1990s. on january 26, 1995, a long march 2E rocket veered off course two seconds after take-off from xichang space center and exploded killing at least six on the groundcitation needed on february 14, 1996, a similar failure occurred during the launch of intelsat 708 the rocket veered severely off course immediately after clearing the launch tower and crashed into a village.1  following the disaster foreign media were sequestered in a bunker for five hours while some have alleged the chinese military attempted to up the damagecitation needed officials later blamed the failure on an gust of wind2 xinhua news agency initially reported 6 deaths and 57 injuries.3  in the aftermath of the explosion us satellite makers shared information that allowed the chinese to determine that the problem was in the welds.4 this sharing of information was later deemed illegal by the united states and us satellite maker loral space and communications was fined million by the us government.5  for thirteen years starting in august 1996, 75 consecutive successful launches were conducted including multiple milestones  on october 15, 2003, the long march 2F rocket successfully launched the shenzhou 5 spacecraftorbiter carrying chinas first astronaut into space china thus became the third nation to send a person in space independently after the soviet unionrussia and the united states  on october 12, 2005, long march 2F launched the shenzhou 6 with two astronauts  on june 1, 2007, long march rockets completed their 100th launch overall  on october 24, 2007, the long march 3A successfully launched GMT8 the 1 lunar orbiting spacecraft from the xichang satellite launch center  on september 25, 2008, a long march 2F launched shenzhou 7, chinas first three-man mission and first eva mission  the string of successful launches ended on august 31, 2009, when the launch of palapa-d partially failed due to a third stage malfunction.6  on the june 11, 2013, a long march 2F, launched from the jiuquan satellite launch center putting three astronauts into orbit for the shenzhou 10 mission.7  as of march 2016update, there have been 225 long march missions.8  payloadsedit  the long march is chinas primary expendable launch system family the shenzhou spacecraft and change lunar orbiters are also launched on the long march rocket the maximum payload for leo is 12,000 kilograms the maximum payload for gto is 5,500kg the next generation rocket long march 5 variants will offer more payload in the future  propellantsedit  long march 1s 1st and 2nd stage uses nitric acid and udmh propellants and its upper stage uses a spin-stabilized solid rocket engine  long march 2, long march 3, long march 4, the main stages and associated liquid rocket boosters use dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizing agent and udmh as the fuel the upper stages stage of long march 3 rockets use YF-73 and YF-75 engines using liquid hydrogen as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer  the new generation of long march rocket family long march 5, and its derivations long march 6, long march 7 will use lox and kerosene as core stage and liquid booster propellant with lox and LH2 in upper stages  variantsedit  timeline of long march rocket families  the long march rockets are organized into several series

launch vehicles in study which is geared towards sso launches.18  long march 9edit  the long march 9 CZ-9, or changzheng 9, chinese is a chinese super-heavy carrier rocket that is currently in study it is planned for a maximum payload capacity of at least 140,000kg19 to leo or at least 50,000kg to lunar transfer Orbit.20 its first flight is expected in 2025 in preparation for a lunar landing sometime in the 2030s. it has been stated that around 70 of the hardware and components needed for a test flight are currently undergoing testing with the first engine test to occur by the end of 2018. the proposed design would be a three-staged rocket with the initial core having a diameter of 10 meters and use a cluster of four engines multiple variants on the rocket have been proposed CZ-9 being the largest with four liquid-fuel boosters with the aforementioned leo payload capacity of 140,000kg, CZ-9A having just two boosters and a leo payload capacity of 100,000kg, and finally CZ-9B having just the core stage and a leo payload capacity of 50,000kg.16 if produced it would be classified as a super heavy-lift launch vehicle along with the american saturn v and unsuccessful soviet N1 and the space launch system and falcon heavy currently under development in the united states  long march 11edit  the long march 11 is a solid-fuel rocket that applies chinas largest solid-fuel rocket engine and was designed to meet the need to rapidly launch satellites in case of emergencies or disasters its first launch on 25 september 2015, was reported to be successful and launched 4 micro satellites into sun-synchronous orbits.2122  originsedit  the long march 1 rocket is derived from earlier chinese 2-stage irbm DF-4, or dong feng 4 missile and long march 2, long march 3, long march 4 rocket families are derivatives of the chinese 2-stage icbms DF-5, or dong feng 5 missile however like its counterparts in both the united states and in russia the differing needs of space rockets and strategic missiles have caused the development of space rockets and missiles to diverge the main goal of a space rocket is to maximize payload while for strategic missiles increased throw weight is much less important than the ability to launch quickly and to survive a first strike this divergence has become clear in the next generation of long march rockets which use cryogenic propellants in sharp contrast to the next generation of strategic missiles which are mobile and solid fuelled  the next generation of long march rocket long march 5 rocket family will be a brand new design while long march 6 and long march 7 can be seen as derivations because they use the liquid rocket booster design of long march 5 to build small-to-mid capacity launch vehicles  launch sitesedit  there are four launch centers in china they are  jiuquan satellite launch center  taiyuan satellite launch center  wenchang satellite launch center  xichang satellite launch center  most of the commercial satellite launches of long march vehicles have been from xichang satellite launch center located in xichang sichuan province wenchang satellite launch center in hainan province is under expansion and will be the main launch center for future commercial satellite launches long march launches also take place from the more military oriented jiuquan satellite launch center in gansu province from which the manned shenzhou spacecraft also launches taiyuan satellite launch center is located in shanxi province and focuses on the launches of sun-synchronous orbit satellites  commercial launch servicesedit  china markets launch services under the china great wall industry Corporation.23 its efforts to launch communications satellites were dealt a blow in the mid-1990s after the united states stopped issuing export licenses to companies to allow them to launch on chinese launch vehicles out of fear that this would help chinas military in the face of this thales alenia space built the Chinasat-6B satellite with no components from the united states whatsoever this allowed it to be launched on a chinese launch vehicle without violating us itar restrictions.24 the launch on a long march 3B rocket was successfully conducted on july 5, 2007. a chinese long march 2D launched venezuelas VRSS-1 remote sensing satellite 1 de miranda on september 29, 2012.  see alsoedit  spaceflight
