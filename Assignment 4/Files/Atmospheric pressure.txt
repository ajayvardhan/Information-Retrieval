atmospheric pressure sometimes also called barometric pressure is the pressure within the atmosphere of earth that of another planet in most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation pressure measures force per unit area with si units of pascals pa 1 Nm2. on average a column of air one square centimetre in cross-section measured from sea level to the top of the earths atmosphere has a mass of about 1.03 kilograms and weight of about 10.1 newtons that weight one square centimeter is a pressure of 10.1 Ncm2 or 101kNm2 a column 1 square inch in cross-section would have a weight of about 14.7lb or about 65.4N.  contents  1 mechanism  2 standard atmosphere  3 mean sea level pressure  4 altitude variation  5 local variation  6 records  7

pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmospherecitation needed it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in compositioncitation needed  standard atmosphereedit  the standard atmosphere atm is a unit of pressure defined as 101325Pa equivalent to 760 mmhg 29.92 inhg and 14.696 psi.1  mean sea level pressureedit  15 year average mean sea level pressure for june july and august and december january and february ERA-15 re-analysis  kollsman-type barometric aircraft altimeter used in north america displaying an altitude of 80ft  the mean sea level pressure is the average atmospheric pressure at sea level this is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the internet when barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressure  the altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment  average sea-level pressure is 1013.25mbar 29.921inHg 760.00mmHg. in aviation weather reports qnh is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals hectopascal 1 millibar except in the united states canada and colombia where it is reported in inches two decimal places of mercury the united states and canada also report sea level pressure slp which is adjusted to sea level by a different method in the remarks section not in the internationally transmitted part of the code in hectopascals or millibars.2 however in canadas public weather reports sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.3  in the us weather code remarks three digits are all that are transmitted decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted 1013.2mbar is transmitted as 132 1000.0mbar is transmitted as 000 998.7 mbar is transmitted as 987 etc the highest sea-level pressure on earth occurs in siberia where the siberian high often attains a sea-level pressure above 1050mbar 31inHg, with record highs close to 1085mbar 32.0inHg. the lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centers of tropical cyclones and tornadoes with a record low of 870mbar 26inHg atmospheric pressure records  altitude variationedit  a very local storm above snfellsjkull showing clouds formed on the mountain by orographic lift  variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude computed for 15C and 0 relative humidity  this plastic bottle was sealed at approximately 14,000 feet altitude and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure at 9,000 feet and 1,000 feet as it was brought down towards sea level  pressure varies smoothly from the earths surface to the top of the mesosphere although the pressure changes with the weather nasa has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round as altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases one can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude.4 temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure the graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15C and a relative humidity of 0.  at low altitudes above sea level the pressure decreases by about 1.2kPa for every 100metres. for higher altitudes within the troposphere the following equation

atmospheric pressure varies widely on earth and these changes are important in studying weather and climate see pressure system for the effects of air pressure variations on weather  atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal cycle caused by global atmospheric tides this effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few millibars and almost zero in polar areas these variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian cycle and semi-circadian cycle  recordsedit  the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on earth 750 meters was 1085.7hPa measured in tosontsengel mongolia on 19 december 2001.5 the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded 750 meters was at agata in evenk autonomous okrug russia 9328E, elevation 261m, 856ft on 31 december 1968 of 1083.8hPa the discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions a standard lapse rate associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations.5  the dead sea the lowest place on earth at 430 metres below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065 hPa.7  the lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870hPa 25.69inHg, set on 12 october 1979, during typhoon tip in the western pacific ocean the measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft.8  measurement based on depth of wateredit  one atmosphere or 14.7psi is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 10.3m thus a diver 10.3m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres of air plus 1atm of water conversely 10.3m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditions  low pressures such as natural gas lines are sometimes specified in inches of water typically written as wc column or wg water gauge a typical gas-using residential appliance in the us is rated for a maximum of 14w.c., which is approximately 35 hpa similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres centimetres or metres are now less commonly used  boiling point of wateredit  boiling water  pure water boils at 100C at earths standard atmospheric pressure the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water.9 because of this the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes.10 a rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils in the mid-19th century this method was used by explorers.11  measurement and mapsedit  an important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newtons theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland plumb bob deviation to show the effect of and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter feet this was then a useful tool for survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful it was part of the of science which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be  see alsoedit  underwater diving portal  atmosphere  barometric formula  barotrauma physical damage
