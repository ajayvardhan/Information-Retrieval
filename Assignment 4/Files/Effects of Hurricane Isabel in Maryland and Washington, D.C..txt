northcarolina  virginia  marylandandwashingtondc  delaware  pennsylvania  new jersey  newyorkandnewengland  the effects of hurricane isabel in maryland and washington dc were among the most damaging from a tropical cyclone in the baltimore-washington metropolitan area united states hurricane isabel formed from a tropical wave on september 6, 2003, in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph on september 11. after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105mph on september 18. it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next day  on september 19, tropical storm isabel passed through extreme western maryland though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state.1 about 1.24million people lost power throughout the state the worst of its effects came from its storm surge which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion on the eastern shore hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed primarily in queen annes county from tidal flooding thousands of houses were affected in central maryland with severe storm surge flooding reported in baltimore and annapolis washington dc sustained moderate damage primarily from the winds throughout maryland and washington damage totaled about 2017USD,1 with only one fatality due to flooding  contents  1

preparationsedit  hurricane isabel shortly after landfall  while isabel was still over the western atlantic ocean as a category 5 hurricane forecasters predicted the storm would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 130miles east-southeast of ocean city maryland as a 115mph major hurricane.2 by four days before isabel made landfall most computer models predicted isabel to make landfall between north carolina and new Jersey.34 on september 16, about two days before the hurricane struck land the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for the southern region of the maryland coastline on the chesapeake bay later that day a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern maryland coastline which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24hours before landfall.1  officials recommended the citizens on smith island to evacuate on the day prior to the hurricane making landfall the only evacuations for the eastern shore of maryland mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in calvert st marys and charles counties and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in howard county officials recommended residents in flood areas of baltimore county to evacuate and some in the city of baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding evacuation rates were low throughout the maryland coastline with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore the primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane between 20 and 33 of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived with similar numbers expressing concern about being able to return to their homes if they evacuated of those who left most went to the house of a friend or family member with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall in most areas the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal the most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees inadequate signage flooded roads or stalled cars in all 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for hurricane Isabel.5 boats trucks and school buses helped more than 1,000people evacuate the inner harbor of baltimore as well.6  washington dc mayor anthony williams declared a state of emergency for the district.7 in

canceled or delayed,9 and the washington metro and metrobus systems were closed entirely.11 workers at the national zoo prepared by moving animals inside and lowering water levels.10  impactedit  eastern shoreedit  rainfall from hurricane isabel  on the eastern shore of maryland hurricane isabel produced a storm surge peaking at 8feet on the chesapeake bay in hoopers island and 6.5feet on the atlantic coast in ocean City.12 the track of the hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay tolchester beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet above mean low water.13 rainfall in the maryland portion of the delmarva peninsula reached 3.2inches in steeles neck the large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area including maximum sustained winds of 52mph and a gust of 66mph in Cambridge.12  tidal flooding from the storm surge forced residents to evacuate near the bay tidal flooding was reported in and around rock hall chestertown skinners neck piney neck and cliffs city and was carried along the chester river slightly inland the flooding destroyed or damaged over 100 homes vehicles and boats and also destroyed the romancoke pier one of the pre-bay bridge ferry landings which was still in use as a fishing pier at the time the flooding also severely damaged eleven marinas three restaurants four hotels one boat-building business and one marine railway in queen annes county the hurricane destroyed 37homes, greatly damaged 151, and moderately damaged 192, with damage totaling 2017USD. the damage was mainly due to the tidal flooding though four homes were destroyed due to falling trees moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees tree limbs and power lines leaving about 65,750homes and businesses without power half of which occurred in cecil county the resulting power outage was described as one of the worst in the history of conectiv energy damage in the eastern shore of maryland totaled about 2017USD.13  central marylandedit  wind gusts in central maryland peaked at 83mph in silver spring with a location along the patuxent river recording sustained winds of 55mph unofficially rainfall reached 7inches in portions of maryland though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches at the baltimore-washington international airport swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the western shore which peaked at 8.2feet in baltimore annapolis also reported a surge of 7.2feet in many locations the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 chesapeake potomac hurricane throughout central maryland 472buildings and homes were destroyed with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons t of salt millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus and millions of gallons of raw sewage into the chesapeake Bay.14 one person died as a result of

though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in frederick county the united states department of agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 1530 of the field corn and 1015 of the soybean crop excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.16  most coastal areas under 10feet above sea level experienced severe wave damage.14 the maryland geological survey estimates the waves removed 20 acres of sand along the coastline based on an estimate of losses in baltimore county the 20 acres of lost in single day represent about 15 of the total beach loss in an average year the average location lost about 5feet of beach and throughout the chesapeake bay the erosion deposited about 81,000tons of sediment into the bay the erosion was irregular however some locations were unaffected while others experienced greater losses despite that the two locations were similar the erosion and storm surge damaged many bulkheads and after the storm surge retreated into the bay it washed away freestanding structures.17 the passage of isabel resulted in an unusual increase in phytoplankton in the middle portion of the chesapeake bay followed by an abrupt return to normal conditions by early October.18  effects by
