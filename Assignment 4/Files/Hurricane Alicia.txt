nebraska upper midwest  part of the 1983 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane alicia was the costliest tropical cyclone in the atlantic since hurricane agnes in 1972. alicia was the third depression the first tropical storm and the only major hurricane of the 1983 atlantic hurricane season it struck galveston and houston texas directly causing in damage and killing 21 people this made it the worst texas hurricane since hurricane carla in 1961.2 in addition alicia was the first billion-dollar tropical cyclone in texas history.3  hurricane alicia was the first hurricane to hit the united states mainland since hurricane allen in august 1980. the time between the two storms totaled three years and eight days hurricane alicia became the last major hurricane or higher to strike texas until the stronger hurricane bret in 1999 made landfall alicia was the first storm for which the national hurricane center issued landfall probabilities.5  hurricane alicia was notable for the delayed post storm evacuation of galveston island the eye of the storm traveled the evacuation route up interstate 45 from galveston to houston the hurricane was also notable for the shattering of many windows in downtown houston by loose gravel from the roofs of new skyscrapers and by other debris prompting changes to rooftop construction codes  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3

the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of hurricane alicia were from a cold front that extended from new england through the central gulf of mexico on August14, mesoscale low-pressure area developed off the alabama and mississippi coastlines.2 around 0100UTC on August15, the low had maintained convection or area of thunderstorms for 12hours, as well as a circulation for sixhours as a result the national hurricane center began issuing dvorak classifications on the system.6 by a few hours later the deep convection became organized in the circulations southern semicircle which prompted a hurricane hunters flight into the system.7 at 1200UTC that day the system developed into tropical depression three about 350miles south-southwest of the mississippi river Delta.8 a few hours later the hurricane hunters confirmed its development.9 such development along the tail end of a cold front is more typical earlier or later in the hurricane season.10  after becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was moving slowly westward due to a ridge to its north.2 a hurricane hunters flight late on August15 reported that the depression reached winds of 50mph as a result the nhc upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm alicia at the time of its upgrade the storm was located in an area of higher than normal atmospheric pressure although conditions favored further development.11 due to high pressures surrounding the storm alicia was a smaller than normal tropical cyclone as a result it produced stronger than normal winds in comparison to its minimum central pressure.2 the storm continued slowly to the west-northwest and by August17 attained hurricane status about 160miles southeast of galveston Texas.8 shortly thereafter an eye became visible on radar,12 as the hurricane executed several small loops.10 its slow movement over warm waters in addition to an anticyclone becoming established over the hurricane caused alicia to undergo rapid deepening.2  hurricane alicia at landfall  at 0600UTC on August18, the winds reached 115mph just before alicia made landfall about 25mi southwest of galveston Texas.8 upon moving ashore the gale-force winds extended 125mi from the center,13 and hurricane-force winds spread across an area from freeport to 60mi northeast.14 its atmospheric pressure was 962mbar 28.41inHg around the time of landfall,8 and radar imagery indicated the presence of a rare double-eye structure.10 alicia quickly weakened passing over central houston with sustained winds of 80mph it accelerated toward the northwest weakening to tropical storm status late on August18 and to tropical depression status twelve hours later.8 tropical depression alicia moved into oklahoma and interacted with an approaching frontal trough by 0600UTC on August20, alicia had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over northwestern oklahoma and by the next day it was no longer identifiable after merging with the trough over eastern Nebraska.28  preparationsedit  see also tropical cyclone warnings and watches  several watches and warnings were issued in association with alicia the first ones were a gale warning and a hurricane watch for the area between corpus christi texas and grand isle louisiana issued on august 16. on august 17, a hurricane warning was issued for the coastline from corpus christi to morgan city louisiana and later for port arthur texas southward.5 initially however residents did not take the warnings seriously galveston mayor e gus manuel against the advice of texas governor mark white ordered the evacuation of only low-lying areas.15 as a result only 10 percent of the population living behind the seawall chose to leave when alicia came ashore in contrast about 30 percent of galvestons population evacuated the island when hurricane allen threatened the eastern texas coastline in 1980.16 throughout the day however as the increasing winds began to cause damage in galveston people grew more concerned the mayor finally ordered a widespread evacuation of the island after midnight on august 18, but by then the bridges to the mainland were uncrossable.15  impactedit  texasedit  alicias storm total rainfall  galveston reported 734in of rain liberty reported 912in of rain and greens bayou reported almost 10in centerville reported over 8 inches with normangee and mexia reporting over 7in maximum rainfall in the houston area in harris county was about 1011in while 8in of rain was reported in leon county and 9in in the sabine river area high gusts were reported throughout texas with a maximum gust of 125mph reported on the coast guard cutter buttonwood stationed at the northeastern tip of galveston Island.10 pleasure pier reported tides of 8.67ft with pier 21 reporting a little over 5.5ft baytown texas reported 1012ft tides and morgan city reported 12.1ft the highest recorded as a result of Alicia.17 the storm also caused extensive disruption of power services a paul simon-art garfunkel reunion concert scheduled for the houston astrodome was canceled due to the coming storm  twenty-three tornadoes were reported in association with alicia fourteen of those were located in the galveston and hobby airport area the other nine were concentrated around tyler to houston Texas,14 ranging around F2 on the fujita scale.16  a major oil spill occurred around texas city and an ocean-going tugboat capsized 50 miles off the sabine pass coast.18 the coast guard air station houston weathered alicia with little damage and afterwards airstas helicopters assisted residents with evacuation supply and survey flights  sixty gallons of water had to be removed from the national weather service office in Galveston18 this weather office also temporarily lost its radar.19 houston suffered billions of dollars in damage thousands of glass panes in downtown skyscrapers were shattered by gravel blown off rooftops.16 although alicia was a small category 3 hurricane a total of 2,297 dwellings were destroyed by alicia with another 3,000 experiencing major damage over ten thousand dwellings had minor damage.14  in galveston the western beach had its public beach boundary shifted back about 150ft about 5 feet of sand was scoured leaving beachfront homes in a natural vegetation state this moved many beachfront homes onto public beach and the attorney generals office declared that they were in violation of the texas open beaches act and forbade the repair or rebuilding of those homes.20 the corps of engineers stated that if the galveston sea wall had not been there that another usd 2017USD in damage could have occurred.20 also if alicia had been the size of hurricane carla from 1961, damage could have easily doubled or possibly tripled.20 alicia damaged chemical and petrochemical plants in Houston.21  elsewhereedit  as alicia progressed northward it produced heavy precipitation in several other areas in oklahoma the rain amounted to 5.51in in south-central portions of the state parts of kansas and nebraska received 1 to 3in to 76mm of rainfall other states including michigan iowa minnesota louisiana and wisconsin experienced light rainfall from the remnants of the storm.22  aftermathedit  wind damage from alicia photographed from a national oceanic and atmospheric administration helicopter  the red cross provided food and shelter to 63,000 people in the hurricanes wake costing about 2017USD.1420 fema gave out 2017USD to alicias victims and local governments usd 2017USD of that was for picking up debris spread after the storm.1 more than 16,000 people sought help from femas disaster service centers the small business administration aided with 56 volunteers interviewed over 16,000 victims and it was predicted that about 7,000 loan applications would be submitted the federal insurance agency had closed over 1,318 flood insurance cases from alicias aftermath however only 782 received final payment.1  on september 23 and september 24, 1983, in the wake of alicia two subcommittees of the us house of representatives held hearings in houston the hearing on september 23 were to examine the primary issues of the nws during alicia the effectiveness of the nws in current procedures and the use of the nws the second hearing which occurred on september 24, was to discuss the damage and recovery efforts during Alicia.1 during the september 23 hearing witnesses agreed that the nws did well before and during the emergency caused by alicia nws forecasters also testified in which they said they gratified themselves that their predictions were well target and that the local emergency plans had worked so well which saved many lives mayor gus manuel on galveston claimed that the nws did an excellent job during alicia he was also very impressed about their landfall predictions on august 17.1 during the september 24 hearing evidence was presented which demonstrated the need for improving readiness to cope with disasters such as alicia mayor manuel mentioned that his town needed stronger building codes which were under review.1  retirementedit  due to the severe damage the name was retired in the spring of 1984 by the world meteorological organization and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane it was the first name to be retired since hurricane allen in 1980.23 it was replaced with for the 1989 season.24  in popular cultureedit  the approach and eventual landfall of alicia is a central plot point in a season 1 episode of the amc television drama halt and catch Fire.25  see alsoedit  houston portal  tropical
