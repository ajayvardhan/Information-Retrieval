polar high  the polar highs are areas of high atmospheric pressure around the north and south poles the north polar high being the stronger one because land gains and loses heat more effectively than sea the cold temperatures in the polar regions cause air to descend to create the high pressure process called subsidence just as the warm temperatures around the equator cause air to rise to create the low pressure intertropical convergence zone rising air also occurs along bands of low pressure situated just below the polar highs around the 50th parallels of latitude these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the polar fronts where air masses of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin.1 this convergence of rising air completes the vertical cycle around the polar cell in each latitudinal hemisphere closely related to this concept is the polar vortex  surface temperatures under the polar highs are the coldest on earth with no month having an average temperature above freezing regions under the polar high also experience very low levels of precipitation which leads them to be known as deserts  air flows outwards from the poles to create the polar easterlies in the arctic and antarctic areas  referencesedit  yochanan kushnir climate system general circulation and climate zones retrieved 13 march 2012.  v  t  e  cyclones and anticyclones of the world of action  types  extratropical  mesocycloneanticyclonic storm  polar  subtropical cyclonesubtropical ridge  thermal  tropical  anticyclones  polar high  siberian high  azores high atlantic  north american high  south atlantic high  north pacific high high  south pacific high  kalahari high  cyclones  aleutian low east russia  atlantic hurricane  australian low coast  european windstorm  genoa low  icelandic low  kona storm  mediterranean tropical-like cyclone  noreaster  pacific hurricane  polar vortex  typhoon  wake low  climatology  retrieved from  categories climatology
