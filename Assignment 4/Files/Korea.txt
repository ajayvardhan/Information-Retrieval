divided into two distinct sovereign states north korea the peoples republic of korea and south korea the of korea located on the korean peninsula korea is bordered by china to the northwest and russia to the northeast it is separated from japan to the east by the korea strait and the sea of japan sea  korea emerged as a singular political entity in 676CE after centuries of conflict among the three kingdoms of korea which were unified as unified silla to the south and balhae to the north unified silla divided into three separate states during the later three kingdoms period goryeo which had succeeded goguryeo defeated the two other states and united the korean peninsula around the same time balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to goryeo goryeo spelled as kory whose name developed into the modern exonym was a highly cultured state that created the worlds first metal movable type in 1234.456789 however multiple invasions by the mongol yuan dynasty during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting following the yuan dynastys collapse severe political strife followed and goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by general yi seong-gye who established joseon in 1392.  the first 200 years of joseon were marked by relative peace during this period the korean alphabet was created by sejong the great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of confucianism during the later part of the dynasty koreas isolationist policy earned it the western nickname of the kingdom by the late 19th century the country became the object of imperial design by the empire of japan after the first sino-japanese war despite the korean empires effort to modernize it was annexed by japan in 1910 and ruled by imperial japan until the end of world war ii in august 1945.  in 1945, the soviet union and the united states agreed on the surrender of japanese forces in korea in the aftermath of world war ii leaving korea partitioned along the 38th parallel the north was under soviet occupation and the south under us occupation these circumstances soon became the basis for the division of korea by the two superpowers exacerbated by their incapability to agree on the terms of korean independence the communist-inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro-western government in the south leading to koreas division into two political entities north korea the democratic peoples republic of korea and south korea the republic of korea tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950. with involvement by foreign troops the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalized peace treaty this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula to date each country contends that it is the sole legitimate government of all of korea they refuse to recognize the other as

fossils may be from as early as 300,000BC.16 the best preserved korean pottery goes back to the paleolithic times around 10,000BC and the neolithic period begins around 6000BC.  according to legend dangun a descendant of heaven established gojoseon in 2333BC. in 108BC, the han dynasty defeated gojoseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies

annexed all of the chinese commanderies  protothree kingdomsedit  main article protothree kingdoms of korea  the protothree kingdoms period sometimes called the multiple states period is the earlier part of what is commonly called the three kingdoms period following the fall of gojoseon but before goguryeo baekje and silla fully developed into kingdoms  this time period saw numerous states spring up from the former territories of gojoseon which encompassed northern korea and southern manchuria with the fall of gojoseon southern korea entered the samhan period  located in the southern part of the korean peninsula samhan refers to the three confederacies of mahan jinhan and byeonhan mahan was the largest and consisted of 54 states byeonhan and jinhan both consisted of twelve states bringing a total of 78 states within the samhan these three confederacies eventually developed into baekje silla and gaya  three kingdomsedit  main articles three kingdoms of korea baekje goguryeo and silla  7th century tang dynasty painting of envoys from the three kingdoms of korea baekje goguryeo and silla  the three kingdoms of korea consisted of goguryeo silla and baekje silla and baekje controlled the southern half of the korean peninsula maintaining the former samhan territories while goguryeo controlled the northern half of the korean peninsula manchuria and the liaodong peninsula uniting buyeo okjeo dongye and other states in the former gojoseon territories.17  goguryeo was a highly militaristic state1819 it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in east Asia,20212223 reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of manchuria to the north parts of inner mongolia to the west,24 parts of russia to the east,25 and the seoul region to the south.26 goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son Jangsu,27282930 who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean Peninsula.3132 in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties,33 most notably the goguryeo-sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.3435363738 in 642, the powerful general yeon gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over goguryeo in response emperor tang taizong of china led a campaign against goguryeo but was defeated and retreated.3940 after the death of tang taizong his son emperor tang gaozong allied with the korean kingdom of silla and invaded goguryeo again but was unable to overcome goguryeos stalwart defenses and was defeated in 662.4142 however yeon gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother with his eldest son defecting to tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla.4344 the tang-silla alliance finally conquered goguryeo in 668. after the collapse of goguryeo tang and silla ended their alliance and fought over control of the korean peninsula silla succeeded in gaining control over most of the korean peninsula while tang gained control over goguryeos northern territories however 30 years after the fall of goguryeo a goguryeo general by the name of dae joyeong founded the korean-mohe state of balhae and successfully expelled the tang presence from much of the former goguryeo territories  seokguram grotto from the silla era a unesco world heritage site  the southwestern korean kingdom of baekje was founded around modern-day seoul by a goguryeo prince a son of the founder of Goguryeo.454647 baekje absorbed all of the mahan states and subjugated most of the western korean peninsula the modern provinces of gyeonggi chungcheong and jeolla as well as parts of hwanghae and gangwon to a centralised government during the expansion of its territory baekje acquired chinese culture and technology through maritime contacts with the southern dynasties baekje was a great maritime power48 its nautical skill which made it the phoenicia of east asia was instrumental in the dissemination of buddhism throughout east asia and continental culture to Japan.4950 historic evidence suggests that japanese culture art and language were influenced by the kingdom of baekje and korea itself235152535455565758596061 baekje also played an important role in transmitting advanced chinese culture to the japanese archipelago baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula most notably in the 4th century during the rule of geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to liaoxi and shandong in china taking advantage of the weakened state of former qin and kyushu in the japanese archipelago62 however baekje was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined.63  although later records claim that silla was the oldest of the three kingdoms of korea it is now believed to have been the last kingdom to develop by the 2nd century silla existed as a large state in the southeast occupying and influencing its neighboring city-states in 562, silla annexed the gaya confederacy which was located between baekje and silla the three kingdoms of korea often warred with each other and silla was often dominated by baekje and goguryeo silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage.6465 in 660, king muyeol ordered his armies to attack baekje general kim yu-shin aided by tang forces conquered baekje after defeating general gyebaek at the battle of hwangsanbeol in 661, silla and tang attacked goguryeo but were repelled king munmu son of muyeol and nephew of general kim yu-shin launched another campaign in 667 and goguryeo fell in the following year  north-south states periodedit  main articles north south states period later silla and balhae  beginning in the 6th century sillas power gradually extended across the korean peninsula silla first annexed the adjacent gaya confederacy in 562. by the 640s, silla formed an alliance with the tang dynasty of china to conquer baekje and later goguryeo after conquering baekje and goguryeo silla repulsed tang china from the korean peninsula in 676. even though silla unified most of the korean peninsula most of the goguryeo territories to the north of the korean peninsula were ruled by balhae former goguryeo general dae jo-yeong led a group of goguryeo and mohe refugees to the jilin and founded the kingdom of balhae 30 years after the collapse of goguryeo as the successor to goguryeo at its height balhaes territories extended from southern manchuria down to the northern korean peninsula balhae was called the country in the East.66  later silla carried on the maritime prowess of baekje which acted like the phoenicia of medieval east Asia,67 and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of east asia and the trade between china korea and japan most notably during the time of jang bogo in addition silla people made overseas communities in china on the shandong peninsula and the mouth of the yangtze River.68697071 later silla was a prosperous and wealthy country,72 and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju73 was the fourth largest city in the world.74757677 later silla was a golden age of art and culture,78798081 as evidenced by the hwangnyongsa seokguram and emille bell buddhism flourished during this time and many korean buddhists gained great fame among chinese Buddhists82 and contributed to chinese Buddhism,83 including woncheuk wonhyo uisang Musang,84858687 and kim gyo-gak a silla prince whose influence made mount jiuhua one of the four sacred mountains of chinese Buddhism.8889909192  later silla fell apart in the late 9th century giving way to the tumultuous later three kingdoms period and balhae was destroyed by the khitans in 926. goryeo unified the later three kingdoms and received the last crown prince and much of the ruling class of balhae thus bringing about a unification of the two successor nations of Goguryeo.93  goryeo dynastyedit  main article goryeo  goryeo was founded in 918 and replaced silla as the ruling dynasty of korea goryeos land was at first what is now south korea and about 13 of north korea but later on managed to recover most of the korean peninsula momentarily goryeo advanced to parts of jiandao while conquering the jurchens but returned the territories due to the harsh climate and difficulties in defending them the name is a short form of and was first used during the time of king jangsu goryeo regarded itself as the successor of goguryeo hence its name and efforts to recover the former territories of Goguryeo.94959697 wang geon the founder of goryeo was of goguryeo descent,98 and traced his ancestry to a noble goguryeo clan.99 he made kaesong his hometown the capital  during this period laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula the development of celadon industries flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries the publication of the tripitaka koreana onto more than 80,000 wooden blocks and the invention of the worlds first metal movable type in the 13th century attest to goryeos cultural achievements.456789  goryeo had to defend frequently against attacks by nomadic empires especially the khitans and the mongols goryeo had a hostile relationship with the khitans because the khitan empire had destroyed balhae also a successor state of goguryeo in 993, the khitans who had established the liao dynasty in 907, invaded goryeo demanding that it make amity with them goryeo sent the diplomat seo hui to negotiate who successfully persuaded the khitans to let goryeo expand to the banks of the amnok river citing that in the past the land belonged to goguryeo the predecessor of Goryeo.100 during the goryeokhitan war the khitan empire invaded korea twice more in 1009 and 1018, but was defeated  after defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time,101102 goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science by 1100, there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.103104  goryeo was invaded by the mongols in seven major campaigns from the 1230s until the 1270s, but was never conquered.105 exhausted after decades of fighting goryeo sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to the mongols kublai khan accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince,105 and the dynastic line of goryeo continued to survive under the overlordship of the mongol yuan dynasty as a semi-autonomous vassal state and compulsory ally the two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses,105 and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess.106  in the 1350s, king gongmin was free at last to reform the goryeo government when the yuan dynasty began to crumble gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with which included the removal of pro-mongol aristocrats and military officials the question of land holding and quelling the growing animosity between the buddhists and confucian scholars during this tumultuous period goryeo momentarily conquered liaoyang in 1356, repulsed two large invasions by the red turbans in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the yuan to dominate goryeo when general choe yeong defeated a mongol tumen in 1364. during the 1380s, goryeo turned its attention to the wokou threat and used naval artillery created by choe museon to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships  joseon dynastyedit  main article joseon  the gyeongbokgung palace  korean plated mail  in 1392, the general yi seong-gye overthrew the goryeo dynasty after he staged a coup and defeated general choe yeong yi seong-gye named his new dynasty joseon and moved the capital from kaesong to hanseong hanyang modern-day seoul and built the gyeongbokgung palace.107 in 1394, he adopted confucianism as the countrys official ideology resulting in much loss of power and wealth by the buddhists the prevailing philosophy of the joseon dynasty was neo-confucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity  joseon was a nominal tributary state of china but exercised full sovereignty,108109 and maintained the highest position among chinas tributary states,110111 which also included countries such as the ryukyu kingdom vietnam Thailand,112113114 the philippines burma laos among others.115116 in addition joseon received tribute from jurchens and japanese until the 17th century,117118119 and had a small enclave in the ryukyu kingdom that engaged in trade with siam and Java.120  during the 15th and 16th centuries joseon enjoyed many benevolent rulers who promoted education and science.121 most notable among them was sejong the great 141850, who promulgated hangul the korean alphabet this golden age121 saw great cultural and scientific advancements,122 including in printing meteorological observation astronomy calendar science ceramics military technology geography cartography medicine and agricultural technology some of which were unrivaled elsewhere.123 joseon implemented a class system that consisted of yangban the noble class jungin the middle class yangin the common class and cheonin the lowest class which included occupations such as butchers tanners shamans entertainers and nobi the equivalent of slaves bondservants or serfs.124125  in 1592 and again in 1597, the japanese invaded korea the korean military at the time was unprepared and untrained due to two centuries of peace on the korean Peninsula.126 toyotomi hideyoshi intended to conquer china and India127 through the korean peninsula but was defeated by strong resistance from the righteous army the naval superiority of admiral yi sun-sin and his turtle ships and assistance from wanli emperor of ming china however joseon experienced great destruction including a tremendous loss of cultural sites such as temples and palaces to japanese pillaging and the japanese brought back to japan an estimated 100,000200,000 noses cut from korean victims.128 less than 30 years after the japanese invasions the manchus took advantage of joseons war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637, and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynasty  after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the 18th century.129130  in the 19th century the royal in-law families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country furthermore the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy earning the nickname hermit kingdom but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders beginning an era leading into japanese imperial rule  korean empireedit  main article korean empire  the earliest surviving depiction of the korean flag was printed in a us navy book flags of maritime nations in july 1889.  beginning in 1871, japan began to exert more influence in korea forcing it out of chinas traditional sphere of influence as a result of the sino-japanese war the qing dynasty had to give up such a position according to article 1 of the treaty of shimonoseki which was concluded between china and japan in 1895. that same year empress myeongseong of korea was assassinated by japanese agents.131  in 1897, the joseon dynasty proclaimed the korean empire king gojong became an emperor during this brief period korea had some success in modernizing the military economy real property laws education system and various industries russia japan france and the united states all invested in the country and sought to influence it politically  in 1904, the russo-japanese war pushed the russians out of the fight for korea

was a forced party to the japan-korea annexation treaty the treaty was signed by lee wan-yong who was given the general power of attorney by the emperor however the emperor is said to have not actually ratified the treaty according to yi Tae-jin.132 there is a long dispute whether this treaty was legal or illegal due to its signing under duress threat of force and bribes  korean resistance to the brutal japanese occupation133134135 was manifested in the nonviolent march 1st movement of 1919, during which 7,000 demonstrators were killed by japanese police and military.136 the korean liberation movement also spread to neighbouring manchuria and siberia  over five million koreans were conscripted for labour beginning in 1939,137 and tens of thousands of men were forced into japans military.138 nearly 400,000 korean labourers died.139 approximately 200,000 girls and women,140 mostly from china and korea were forced into sexual slavery for the japanese military.141 in 1993, japanese chief cabinet secretary yohei kono acknowledged the terrible injustices faced by these euphemistically named women.142143  during the japanese annexation the korean language was suppressed in an effort to eradicate korean national identity koreans were forced to take japanese surnames known as Sshi-kaimei.144 traditional korean culture suffered heavy losses as numerous korean cultural artifacts were destroyed145 or taken to Japan.146 to this day valuable korean artifacts can often be found in japanese museums or among private collections.147 one investigation by the south korean government identified 75,311 cultural assets that were taken from korea 34,369 in japan and 17,803 in the united states however experts estimate that over 100,000 artifacts actually remain in Japan.146148 japanese officials considered returning korean cultural properties but to date146 this has not occurred.148 korea and japan still dispute the ownership of the dokdo islets located east of the korean Peninsula.149  there was a significant level of emigration to the overseas territories of the empire of japan during the japanese occupation period including Korea.150 by the end of world war ii there were over 850,000 japanese settlers in Korea.151 after world war ii most of these overseas japanese repatriated to japan  divisionedit  main articles division of korea korean conflict and

assuage this problem king sejong created the unique alphabet known as hangul to promote literacy among the common people.197 hangul day was founded in 1926 during the japanese occupation by members of the korean language society whose goal was to preserve the korean language during a time of rapid forced Japanization.198 today both south korea and north korea celebrate hangul day as a national
