waterston  bookthermodynamics  v  t  e  enthalpy is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system it is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume.1  more technically it includes the internal energy which is the energy required to create a system and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.2  enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the systems internal energy pressure and volume it is an extensive quantity the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the international system of units is the joule but other historical conventional units are still in use such as the british thermal unit and the calorie  enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical biological and physical measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of energy transfer at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work  the total enthalpy h of a system cannot be measured directly the same situation exists in classical mechanics only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system we must refer to a defined reference point therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy h the h is a positive change in endothermic reactions and negative in heat-releasing exothermic processes  for processes under constant pressure h is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system plus the pressure-volume work that the system has done on its surroundings.3 this means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed released by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume standard state most commonly 1 bar pressure standard state does not strictly speaking specify a temperature standard state but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25C.  enthalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure unlike entropy and gibbs energy real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses  contents  1 origins  2 formal

enthalpein which means warm in.4 it combines the classical greek prefix en- meaning put into and the verb thalpein meaning heat the word enthalpy is often incorrectly attributed to benot paul mile clapeyron and rudolf clausius through the 1850 publication of their clausiusclapeyron relation this misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of the mollier steam tables and diagrams however neither the concept the word nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after clapeyrons death  the earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875,5 when josiah willard gibbs introduced heat function for constant pressure however gibbs did not use the word in his writingsnote 1  the actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by j p dalton according to that publication heike kamerlingh onnes actually coined the word.6  over the years scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy in 1922 alfred w porter proposed the symbol as a standard,7 thus finalizing the terminology still in use today  in the past enthalpy was sometimes called heat content.879 the fact that the change in enthalpy h equals the heat absorbed in processes at constant pressure is the reason for this name.10 however this equality is not true in general the pressure varies so that the term heat content is considered misleading11 and is now deprecated  formal definitionedit  the enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as1213  where  h is the enthalpy of the system  u is the internal energy of the system  p is the pressure of the system  v is the volume of the system  enthalpy is an extensive property this means that for homogeneous systems the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system it is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy hhm where m is the mass of the system or the molar enthalpy hmhn where n is the number of moles and hm are intensive properties for inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems  where the label k refers to the various subsystems in case of continuously varying p t or composition the summation becomes an integral  where is the density  the enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function hsp of the entropy s and the pressure p and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows we start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process  here q is a small amount of heat added to the system and w a small amount of work performed by the system in a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place so the second law of thermodynamics gives q tds with t the absolute temperature of the system furthermore if only pv work is done w pdv as a result  adding dpv to both sides of this expression gives  or  so  other expressionsedit  the above expression of dh in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers however there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure128814  here cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure and is the coefficient of thermal expansion  with this expression one can in principle determine the enthalpy if cp and v are known as functions of p and t  note that for an ideal gas T1,note 2 so that  in a more general form the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types the differential statement for dh then becomes  where i is the chemical potential per particle for an i-type particle and ni is the number of such particles the last term can also be written as idni dni the number of moles of component i added to the system and in this case i the molar chemical potential or as idmi dmi the mass of component i added to the system and in this case i the specific chemical potential  physical interpretationedit  the u term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system and the pv term as the energy that would be required to room for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant when a system for example n moles of a gas of volume v at pressure p and temperature t is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy u plus pv where pv is the work done in pushing against the ambient pressure  in basic physics and statistical mechanics it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.1516 in basic chemistry experiments are often conducted at constant atmospheric pressure and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled so that h is the expression chosen for the heat of reaction  for a heat engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the pressure-volume work done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine17  where the work w done by the engine is  relationship to heatedit  in order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply we return to the first law for closed systems du q w we apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface in this case the work term can be split into two contributions the so-called pv work given by pdv here p is the pressure at the surface dv is the increase of the volume of the system and all other types of work w such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction so we write w pdv w in this case the first law reads  or  from this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added heat  provided that the system is under constant pressure and that the only work done by the system is expansion work  applicationsedit  in thermodynamics one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from the mechanical work required pv differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic system  energy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system assuming that the pressure p remains constant this is the pv term the supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy u which includes activation energies ionization energies mixing energies vaporization energies chemical bond energies and so forth together these constitute the change in the enthalpy upv for systems at constant pressure with no external work done other than the pv work the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system  for a simple system with a constant number of particles the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.19  heat of reactionedit  main article standard enthalpy of reaction  the total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly the enthalpy change of a system is measured instead enthalpy change is defined by the following equation  where  h is the change  hf is the final enthalpy of the system a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the products  hi is the initial enthalpy of the system a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the reactants  for an exothermic reaction at constant pressure the systems change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings in a similar manner for an endothermic reaction the systems change in enthalpy is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction including the energy lost by the system and gained from compression from its surroundings a relatively easy way to determine whether or not a reaction is exothermic or endothermic is to determine the sign of h if h is positive the reaction is endothermic that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants on the other hand if h is negative the reaction is exothermic that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.20  specific enthalpyedit  the specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as h hm where m is the mass of the system the si unit for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram it can be expressed in other specific quantities by h u pv where u is the specific internal energy p is the pressure and v is specific volume which is equal to 1, where is the density  enthalpy changesedit  an enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction it is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed ie the enthalpy of the products and the initial enthalpy of the system ie the reactants these processes are reversiblewhy and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change  a common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation which has been determined for a large number of substances enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works such as the crc handbook of chemistry and physics the following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics  when used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and the property is simply termed enthalpy of since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters or standard conditions including  a temperature of 25C or 298K,  a pressure of one atmosphere or 101.325kPa,  a concentration of 1.0M when the element or compound is present in solution  elements or compounds in their normal physical states ie standard state  for such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term standard eg standard enthalpy of formation  chemical properties  enthalpy of reaction defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely  enthalpy of formation defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents  enthalpy of combustion defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen  enthalpy of hydrogenation defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound  enthalpy of atomization defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely  enthalpy of neutralization defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react  standard enthalpy of solution defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent so that the solution is at infinite dilution  standard enthalpy of denaturation defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound  enthalpy of hydration defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions  physical properties  enthalpy of fusion defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and liquid states  enthalpy of vaporization defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states  enthalpy of sublimation defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states  lattice enthalpy defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart no force of attraction  enthalpy of mixing defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two chemical substances  open systemsedit  in thermodynamic open systems matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries the first law of thermodynamics for open systems states the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system  where uin is the average internal energy entering the system and uout is the average internal energy leaving the system  during steady continuous operation an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added  the region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a control volume and it may or may not correspond to physical walls if we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid there are then two types of work performed flow work described above which is performed on the fluid is also often called pv work and shaft work which may be performed on some mechanical device  these two types of work are expressed in the equation  substitution into the equation above for the control volume yields  the definition of enthalpy h permits us to use this thermodynamic potential to account for both internal energy and pv work in fluids for open systems  if we allow also the system boundary to move due to moving pistons we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.21 in terms of time derivatives it reads  with sums over the various places k where heat is supplied matter flows into the system and boundaries are moving the k terms represent enthalpy flows which can be written as  with k the mass flow and k the molar flow at position k respectively the term dvkdt represents the rate of change of the system volume at position k that results in pv power done by the system the parameter p represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power but it can also be eg electric power produced by an electrical power plant  note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outletclarification needed otherwise it has to be included in the enthalpy balance during steady-state operation of a device turbine pump and engine the average dudt may be set equal to zero this yields a useful expression for the average power generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions  where the angle brackets denote time averages the technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems as formulated above  diagramsedit  ts

saturated gas the black curves give the ts relation along isobars the pressures are indicated in bar the blue curves are isenthalps of constant enthalpy the values are indicated in blue in kjkg the specific points a b etc are treated in the main text  nowadays the enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form there are many types of diagrams such as ht diagrams which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures and hp diagrams which give h as function of p for various t one of the most common diagrams is the temperaturespecific entropy diagram it gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps these diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer  some basic applicationsedit  the points a through h in the figure play a role in the discussion in this

throttlingedit  main article joulethomson effect  schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state fluid enters the system rectangle at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. the mass flow is  one of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process also known as joule-thomson expansion it concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance porous plug or any other type of flow resistance as shown in the figure this process is very important since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator it is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers  for a steady state flow regime the enthalpy of the system rectangle has to be constant hence  since the mass flow is constant the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same  that is the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling the consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ts diagram above point c is at 200bar and room temperature a joulethomson expansion from 200bar to 1bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425kJkg shown in the diagram lying between the 400 and 450kJkg isenthalps and ends in point d which is at a temperature of about 270K. hence the expansion from 200bar to 1bar cools nitrogen from 300K to 270K. in the valve there is a lot of friction and a lot of entropy is produced but still the final temperature is below the starting value  point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with h 100 kjkg it corresponds roughly with p 13 bar and t 108 k throttling from this point to a pressure of 1bar ends in the two-phase region f this means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in f is equal to the enthalpy in g multiplied by the liquid fraction in f plus the enthalpy in h multiplied by the gas fraction in f xf so  with numbers 100 xf 28 xf 230, so xf0.64. this means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquidgas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64.  compressorsedit  main article gas compressor  schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state fluid enters the system rectangle at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. the mass flow is a power p is applied and a heat flow q is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ta  a power p is applied eg as electrical power if the compression is adiabatic the gas temperature goes up in the reversible case it would be at constant entropy which corresponds with a vertical line in the ts diagram for example compressing nitrogen from 1 bar a to 2 bar b would result in a temperature increase from 300 k to 380 k in order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ta heat exchange eg by cooling water is necessary in the ideal case the compression is isothermal the average heat flow to the surroundings is q since the system is in the steady state the first law gives  the minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible in that case the second law of thermodynamics for open systems gives  eliminating q gives for the minimal power  for example compressing 1kg of nitrogen from 1bar to 200bar costs at least ha tasc sa with the data obtained with the ts diagram we find a value of 461 300 6.85 476kJkg.  the relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as  with dh tds vdp this results in the final relation  see alsoedit  standard enthalpy change of formation table  calorimetry  calorimeter  departure function  hesss law  isenthalpic process  stagnation enthalpy  thermodynamic
