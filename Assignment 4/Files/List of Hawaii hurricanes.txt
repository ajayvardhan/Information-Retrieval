list of hawaii hurricanes  category 4 hurricane iniki hawaiis most notable hurricane  a hawaiian hurricane is a tropical cyclone that forms in the pacific ocean and affects the hawaiian islands hawaii lies in the central pacific where about four or five tropical cyclones appear each year although as many as fifteen have occurred such as in the 2015 season rarely do these storms actually affect hawaii tropical cyclone records were not kept before the 1950s. earlier windstorms that struck hawaii were not labeled as hurricanes.1  contents  1 list of tropical cyclones  1.1 Pre1950  1.2 1950s

external links  list of tropical cyclonesedit  tracks of all the tropical cyclones to affect hawaii since 1949  this list contains every tropical cyclone that had a somewhat notable effect on the state of hawaii  Pre1950edit  september 1843 the earliest report of a tropical cyclone that could have affected hawaii was made in 1843. on september 23, a german ship recorded a cyclone later as the of the lark near 17N and 141W. no further records are available but extrapolation of its forward movement predicted that it would make landfall on the southern coast of the big island of Hawaii.2  august 1871 excerpts from a honolulu newsletter known as the hawaiian gazette described an august weather event that at least resembled a tropical cyclone quotes from captains and civilians describe a severe windstorm that ravaged the islands for several hours damage is unrecorded.2  november 1874 in november a possible tropical cyclone may have dropped over 20 inches of rain on honolulu and southerly gales destroyed 23 homes and damaged at least 50.2  december 190203 a low pressure system later as froc cyclone that took a path similar to that of a tropical cyclone passed through kaulakahi channel in late december 1902. no records of unusual weather were recorded so the storm was likely still forming as it crossed Hawaii.3  october 1906 in october a tropical cyclone passed about 60 miles south of south point heavy rains were recorded heaviest in years a little over 12 inches fell in 4hours.3  november 1906 90 miles south of honolulu on november 3, 1906, a tropical cyclone was recognized the storm supposedly tracked northward passing through the kauai channel this cyclone must have been abnormally small or very weak because climatological records show no unusual rainfall wind surge or low pressure the storm dissipated near british Columbia.3  august 1925 in august high seas and gusty winds were recorded in hawaii from a nearby tropical cyclone.3  august 1938

about damage in kauai and dropped over 20 inches of rain in 14hours. nina set a record for the highest wind gust ever recorded in honolulu 82 miles per hour nina killed four people throughout the islands.4  august 1958 on august 7, a tropical storm seemed to rapidly appear directly off the coast of hilo it moved across the islands dropping considerable rainfall and causing about of damage before dissipating.5  august 1959 hurricane dot was another powerful august arrival dot entered the central pacific as a Category4 hurricane just south of hawaii on august 5, dot seemed to turn more northwest aiming it directly at kauai on the 6th, dot began weakening and at its landfall in kauai dot was only a category 1 hurricane despite being greatly weakened the hurricane brought gusts of over 100 miles per hour in some areas of the island palm trees snapped in half suggesting winds were locally over 125 miles per hour damages from dot cost no more than a few million dollars and rainfall was relatively light around 4 inches no dot-related deaths were recorded.6  1960sedit  september 1963 tropical storm irah crossed the islands as a tropical depression bringing 36 miles per

2014  1  hawaiis apparent immunity to most hurricanesedit  hurricanes in the central pacific w to 180 w generally travel from east to west however some including hurricanes iwa and iniki track in a northerly direction  the islands of hawaii with kauai as the notable exception appear to be remarkably immune from direct hurricane hits the usgs states that commonly near-misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands.31 this has also drawn media attention.3233 one notion is that hawaiis volcanic peaks slow down or divert storms.34 a partial source of this idea may be the long list of hurricanes in the above paragraphs that dissipated into tropical storms or depressions upon approaching the islands satellite images of hurricane flossies breakup when approaching hawaii island fueled this idea.35 another example may be hurricane felicia which dropped from category 4 down to a tropical depression with residual winds predicted at only 35 miles per hour  snow on mauna loa and mauna kea after storm passes hawaii island  tropical storm flossie to be confused with hurricane flossie in 2007 provides still another example on july 28, 2013, the storm appeared headed for a direct hit to the big island home to mauna kea and mauna loa both mountains rise to elevations in excess of 13,000 feet above sea level and as flossie approached the island its track shifted abruptly overnight and assumed a more northerly alignment heading instead to the island of maui on july 29.37  wind data in particular supports the usgs assertion that hurricane damage has been low on all islands except for kauai data collected by the western regional climate center show no hurricane-strength winds on any hawaii islands with the exception of Kauai.38 despite this data fema classified all of hawaii as being in a debris Region.394041  before hurricane iniki in 1992, a standard homeowners insurance policy with extended coverage provided hurricane coverage since iniki many insurance policies exclude hurricane and a separate hurricane policy is required to obtain hurricane coverage  see alsoedit  central pacific hurricane center  list of pacific hurricanes  list of pacific hurricane seasons  list of wettest tropical cyclones to affect hawaii  tropical cyclone
