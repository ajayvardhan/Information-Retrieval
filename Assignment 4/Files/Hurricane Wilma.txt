intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the atlantic basin as well as the most intense recorded in the western hemisphere until hurricane patricia in 2015. part of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season which included three of the top ten most intense atlantic hurricanes ever with rita and katrina wilma was the twenty-second storm thirteenth hurricane sixth major hurricane fourth category 5 hurricane and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season a tropical depression formed in the caribbean sea near jamaica on october 15, headed westward and two days later intensified into a tropical storm which turned abruptly southward and was named wilma wilma continued to strengthen and eventually became a hurricane on october 18. shortly thereafter explosive intensification occurred and in only 24 hours wilma became a category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of 185 miles per hour  wilmas intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a category 5 hurricane and winds had decreased to 150 miles per hour before it reached the yucatn peninsula on october 20 and 21. after crossing the yucatn wilma emerged into the gulf of mexico as a category 2 hurricane as wilma began accelerating to the northeast gradual re-intensification occurred and the hurricane was upgraded to category 3 on october 24. shortly thereafter wilma made landfall in cape romano florida with winds of 120 miles per hour as wilma was crossing florida it briefly weakened back to a category 2 hurricane but again re-intensified as it reached the atlantic ocean the hurricane intensified into a category 3 hurricane for the last time but dropped below that intensity while accelerating northeastward by october 26, wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of nova scotia  wilma made several landfalls with the most destructive effects felt in the yucatn peninsula of mexico cuba and the us state of florida at least 62 deaths were reported and damage total estimated at to in 2017, with in the united states in 2017.1 as a result wilma is ranked as the sixth costliest hurricane in united states history wilma was the most recent major hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states until hurricane harvey made landfall in southern texas on august 26, 2017, ending a record length of time slightly over 11 years and 10 months without any major hurricanes making landfall in the united states wilma was also the last hurricane to strike the state of florida until hurricane hermine did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, another record wilma was also the last major hurricane to make landfall in florida until hurricane irma made landfall in early september 2017.  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  2.1 cayman islands and central america

wilma  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the caribbean sea during mid-october as a lower-tropospheric low interacted with a broad area of disturbed weather aided by an upper-level low across the region a broad area of low pressure developed on october 13 to the southeast of jamaica and slowly became more concentrated as upper-level wind shear gradually decreased dvorak classifications began on october 14, and by late october 15 the surface circulation in the system became well enough defined with sufficiently organized deep convection for the national hurricane center to designate the system as tropical depression twenty-four while located about 220mi east-southeast of grand Cayman.1  the depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm sea surface temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into tropical storm wilma on october 17. initially development was slow due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient however convection gradually organized and from october 18 through october 19, wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the caribbean sea around 1200UTC on October18, the system intensified into a hurricane in a 30hour period the pressure dropped from 982mbar 29.00inHg to the record-low of 882mbar 26.05inHg, while the winds increased to 185mph during its intensification on October19, the hurricanes eye shrank to as small as 2.3mi in diameter becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cyclone.1  play media  satellite video of wilmas lifespan  on October20, wilma weakened below category 5 intensity to 155mph due to an eyewall replacement cycle began to turn towards the northwest and further slowed its movement late on October21, wilma made landfall on the island of cozumel quintana roo at around 2145UTC with maximum sustained winds of 150mph and then again made a second landfall on the mexican mainland six hours later and only slightly weaker wilma continued to slowly drift towards the north over the yucatn peninsula although it weakened to a moderate hurricane while over land it reemerged over the southern gulf of mexico on october 23 around 0000UTC. despite wilma spending 24 hours over land it remerged with little intensity lost and began to re-intensify shortly after this was perhaps due to its large size and because the majority of its circulation remained over the warm waters of the northwest caribbean and gulf of mexico a powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and accelerated its forward motion its large eye remained well-organized and wilma intensified despite increasing amounts of wind shear briefly producing winds of 125mph before making landfall on cape romano florida as a 120mph major hurricane.1  wilma crossed the state in about 4.6hours and weakened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110mph after entering the atlantic ocean near jupiter florida key west received several feet of water in the low-lying areas and flooded homes the lower keys also experienced an unusual flood it occurred twice first as the storm approached florida it pushed water across the keys from south to north as the storm finally crossed into the everglades all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as wilma crossed the peninsula the water then raced back across the lower keys a second time and went back out to sea this caused additional flooding and costly damage possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the gulf stream wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125mph and subsequently absorbed tropical storm alpha to the south before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection on october 26, wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and on the next day the remnants of wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over atlantic Canada.1  preparationsedit  cayman islands and central americaedit  the national hurricane center issued many tropical

grand bahama and new Providence.1 the government of the bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion though many failed to fully prepare believing wilma would pass through the region as a tropical storm many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters as well officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of grand bahama island and established multiple shelters on the island.13 evacuations were minimal it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left.1314 as most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane hardware stores

1933 season moving slowly over warm water with little wind shear wilma strengthened steadily and became a hurricane on october 18. the thirteenth hurricane of the season wilma broke the record set in 1969 for most storms of hurricane strength in one season for the atlantic basin  the barometric pressure measured in wilma 882mbar is currently the lowest recorded pressure for a tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin as well as the second-lowest pressure for any cyclone measured in the western hemisphere only after hurricane patricia ten years later in the eastern pacific it also reached its 882mbar pressure in a span of 24hours, making it the fastest pressure drop of any storm in the atlantic basin although hurricane felix of 2007 reached a greater windspeed rise in 51hours. at its peak intensity the eye of wilma was about 2.3 miles in diameter the smallest known eye of a tropical cyclone.1 in mexico isla mujeres reported 64inches of rainfallfive times what hurricane gilbert dropped this set a 24-hour rainfall record for the country of mexico and was the highest point total for rainfall from a tropical cyclone since hurricane mitch in 1998. wilma is also the costliest hurricane in mexican history  wilma was the first retired name since the world meteorological organization started retiring names in 1954, it was the strongest atlantic hurricane to be retired and when it was retired it made 2005 the season with the most retired names with five the old record was a three-way tie with four names retired in 1955, 1995, and 2004. wilma was replaced with the name whitney had
