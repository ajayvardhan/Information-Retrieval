on an interim basis until the bmkgs staff had the training to run the TCWC.2 tcwc perth then took over the warning and naming responsibilities until the 2007-08 season when they handed it back to tcwc Jakarta.2 the first depression to be named by tcwc jakarta came later that year when cyclone durga became a tropical cyclone within their area of responsibility.2 during the next two seasons tcwc jakarta monitored several tropical cyclones in the north western pacific ocean and the australian region at the start of the 2010-11 season tcwc jakartas area of responsibility was then extended out to include the region from the equator to 10S between 125E and 141E.  referencesedit  indonesian bmg becomes bmkg  a b c d operation of jakarta tropical cyclone warning centre jakarta indonesian
