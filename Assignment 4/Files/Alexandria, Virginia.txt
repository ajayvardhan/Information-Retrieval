of Virginia.55 that tract would later become the city of Alexandria.55 virginias comprehensive tobacco inspection law of 1730 mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale one of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper potomac river was at the mouth of hunting Creek.6 however the ground proved to be unsuitable and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river where the water was deep near the shore  following the 1745 settlement of the virginias 10 year dispute with lord fairfax over the western boundary of the northern neck proprietary when the privy council in london found in favor of lord fairfaxs expanded claim some of the fairfax county gentry formed the ohio company of virginia they intended to conduct trade into the interior of america and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the potomac the best location was hunting creek tobacco warehouse since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships many local tobacco planters however wanted a new town further up hunting creek away from nonproductive fields along the river.7  around 1746, captain philip alexander ii moved to what is south of present duke street in alexandria his estate which consisted of 500 acres was bounded by hunting creek hooffs run the potomac river and approximately the line which would become cameron street at the opening of virginias 174849 legislative session there was a petition submitted in the house of burgesses on november 1, 1748, that the of fairfax praying that a town may be established at hunting creek warehouse on potowmack river as hugh west was the owner of the warehouse the petition was introduced by lawrence washington the representative for fairfax county and more importantly the son-in-law of william fairfax and a founding member of the ohio company to support the companys push for a town on the river lawrences younger brother george washington an aspiring surveyor made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.8  since the river site was amidst his estate philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of hunting creek known as great hunting creek it has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town alexandria in honor of philips family as a result philip and his cousin captain john alexander gave land to assist in the development of alexandria and are thus listed as the founders this john was the son of robert alexander ii on may 2, 1749, the house of burgesses approved the river location and ordered washington do go up with a message to the council and acquaint them that this house have agreed to the amendments titled an act for erecting a town at hunting creek warehouse in the county of Fairfax.9 a vendue was advertised for july and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots the auction was conducted on july 1314, 1749.  almost immediately upon establishment the town founders called the new town believed to be in honor of a scottish patriot john hamilton 2nd lord belhaven and stenton the northern neck tobacco trade being then dominated by scots the name belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a church and market house but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.10 the town of alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779.  in 1755, general edward braddock organized his fatal expedition against fort duquesne at carlyle house in alexandria in april 1755, the governors of virginia and the provinces of maryland pennsylvania massachusetts and new york met to determine upon concerted action against the french in America.11  in march 1785, commissioners from virginia and maryland met in alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states finishing their business at mount vernon the mount vernon conference concluded on march 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the potomac river the maryland legislature in ratifying this agreement on november 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations this led to the calling of the annapolis convention of 1786, which in turn led to the calling of the federal convention of 1787.11  in 1791, alexandria was included in the area chosen by george washington to become the district of columbia  early 19th centuryedit  slave ship

town as well as the areas of the city northeast of what is now king streetand all of todays arlington county share the distinction of having been originally in virginia ceded to the us government to form the district of columbia and later retroceded to virginia by the federal government in 1846, when the district was reduced in size to exclude the portion south of the potomac river over time a movement grew to separate alexandria from the district of columbia district of columbia retrocession as competition grew with the port of georgetown and the chesapeake and ohio canal fostered development on the north side of the potomac river the citys economy stagnated together with the loss of representation and rights to vote and failed expectations for economic benefit from the new district alexandria was also an important port and market in the slave trade and there were increasing talk of abolition of slavery in the national capital alexandrias economy would suffer greatly if slavery were outlawed after a referendum voters petitioned congress and virginia to return the area to virginia congress retroceded the area to virginia on july 9, 1846.17 the city of alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of alexandria county in 1870. the remaining portion of alexandria county changed its name to arlington county in 1920.  late 19th centuryedit  map of

to be called the library company of alexandria members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues the company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the general assembly of virginia  first city library location within an apothecary shop  druggist edward stabler was elected the first librarian and the librarys first location is believed to have been housed in his apothecary shop james kennedy was elected the second librarian and the library moved to his residence and place of business kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the library company those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library the first catalog of the librarys collection was published in 1797. the collection grew over time bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books most members were initially men although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. one noted female member in 1817 was mary lf custis wife of george washington parke custis  the catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books mostly on history and travel by 1815, there were 1,022 entries in the catalog and the collection had added more biographies fiction and magazines the library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years including the new market house next to the

raise money speakers included professor joseph henry of the smithsonian colonel francis h smith of the virginia military institute and humorist george w bagby  the arrival of the civil war in 1861 took its toll on the library collection members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the librarys occupation by union troops the library was used as a hospital and much of the librarys collection was lost during this time after the war the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the library company closed the remainder of its collection was stored in peabody hall  in 1897, a group of women in alexandria formed the alexandria library association the leaders of the group were virginia corse mrs william b smoot and virginia burke they petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in peabody hall using the old books stored there permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on december 1, 1897. in 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of prince street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the confederate hall located at 806 prince street in may 1903, the library moved to the confederate hall now known as the robert e lee camp hall museum where it stayed for 34 years  in 1936, dr and mrs robert south barrett presented a proposal to the library association they agreed to donate a building in memory of dr barretts mother kate waller barrett if the city would commit to running it as a public library the city agreed and the society of friends offered a 99-year lease on an old quaker graveyard located on queen street the old library was closed on march 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library which opened to the public in august 1937. the alexandria library association became the alexandria library society  in 1939, the barrett library was the scene of possibly the nations first sit-in demonstrations as samuel tucker a young law school graduate from the neighborhood and several other african-american residents insisted on access to the racially segregated library where they had been banned tucker later became a prominent attorney in Richmond.3637  in 1947, the
