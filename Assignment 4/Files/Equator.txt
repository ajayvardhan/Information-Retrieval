equator  for other uses see equator  0  equator  nations or territories that touch the equator or the iers reference meridian  an equator is the intersection of the surface of a rotating spheroid as a planet with the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation and midway between its poles  on earth the equator is an imaginary line on the surface equidistant from the north and south poles dividing the earth into northern and southern hemispheres it is about 40,075 kilometres long of which 78.7 lies across water and 21.3 over land  contents  1 overview  2 geodesy  2.1 precise location  2.2 exact

equator near the town of pontianak indonesia  right road sign marking the equator near nanyuki kenya  the latitude of the earths equator is by definition 0 degrees of arc the equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on earth the other four are the two polar circles arctic circle and the antarctic circle and the two tropical circles tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn the equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle that is one whose plane passes through the center of the globe the plane of earths equator when projected outwards to the celestial sphere defines the celestial equator  in the cycle of earths seasons the plane of the equator passes through the sun twice per year at the march and september equinoxes to an observer on the earth the sun appears to travel north or south over the equator the celestial equator at these times light rays from the center of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth at the point of solar noon on the equator  the equator marked as it crosses ilhu das rolas in so tom and prncipe  the marco zero monument marking the equator in macap brazil  locations on the equator experience the quickest sunrises and sunsets because the sun moves nearly perpendicular to the horizon for most of the year the length of daylight to sunset is almost constant throughout the year it is about fourteen minutes longer than nighttime due to atmospheric refraction and the fact that sunrise is begun sunset is ended as the upper edge not the centre of the suns disk crosses the horizon  the earth bulges slightly at the equator the diameter of the earth is 12,750 kilometres but the diameter at the equator is about 43 kilometres greater than at the poles.1  sites near the equator such as the guiana space centre in kourou french guiana are good locations for spaceports as they have a faster rotational speed than other latitudes the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft because the earth spins to the east spacecraft must also launch to the east to the southeast or northeast to take advantage of this earth-boost of speedcitation needed  geodesyedit  further information earth ellipsoid and reference ellipsoid  precise locationedit  the precise location of the equator is not truly fixed the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the earths spin axis which drifts about 9 metres during a year this effect must be accounted for in detailed geophysical measurementscitation needed  exact lengthedit  in two widely used geodetic standards the equator is modelled as a circle whose radius is a whole number of metres in 1976 the iau chose a radius of 6,378.140 kilometres as the IAU-1976 value later refined by the iugg to 6,378.137 kilometres and adopted in WGS-84. despite this change the yet more recent IAU-2000 retained the old IAU-1976 value if it were really circular the length of the equator would be exactly 2 times the radius namely 40,075.036 kilometres however due to the effect of tidal force on the earths surface the actual circumference at the equator is about 40,075.16 kilometres  the geographical mile is defined as one arc minute of the equator so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed for example by WSG-84, the distance is 1,855.3248 metres while by IAU-2000, it is 1,855.3257 metres this is a difference of less than one millimeter over the total distance 1.86 kilometres  the earth is commonly modeled as a sphere flattened 0.336 along its axis this makes the equator 0.16 longer than a meridian great circle passing through the two poles the iugg standard meridian is to the nearest millimetre 40,007.862917 kilometres one arc minute of which is 1,852.216 metres explaining the si standardization of the nautical mile as 1,852 metres more than 3 metres less than the geographical mile  the sea-level surface of the earth geoid is irregular so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine aviation week and space technology on 9 october 1961 reported that measurements using the transit iv-a satellite had shown the equatorial from longitude 11 west to 169 east to be 1,000 feet greater than its ninety degrees awaycitation needed  crossing-the-equator ceremoniesedit  main article line-crossing ceremony  certain navies such as the royal navy russian navy and us navy have a tradition of holding ceremonies aboard ships to mark sailors first crossing of the equator these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their brutalitycitation needed milder line-crossing ceremonies typically featuring king neptune are also held for passengers entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise shipscitation needed  equatorial countries and

seasons and climateedit  main articles seasons tropics and effect of sun angle on climate  diagram of the seasons depicting the situation at the december solstice regardless of the time of day the earths rotation on its axis the north pole will be dark and the south pole will be illuminated see also arctic winter in addition to the density of incident light the dissipation of light in the atmosphere is greater when it falls at a shallow angle  seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earths axis relative to the plane of revolution during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to earths position in its orbit the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter solstice  at the equinoxes the earths axis is not tilted toward the sun instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12 hours long as is the night across the whole of the earth  the equator lies mostly on the three largest oceans the atlantic ocean the indian ocean and the pacific ocean near the equator there is little temperature fluctuation throughout the year though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity the terms summer autumn winter and spring do not generally apply lowlands around the equator generally have a tropical rainforest climate also known as an equatorial climate though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical monsoon climates with a dry season in the middle of the year and the somali current generated by the asian monsoon due to continental heating via the high tibetan plateau causes greater somalia to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location  average annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around 30C during the day and 23C at night rainfall is away from cold current upwelling zones very high from 2,500 to 3,500mm to 138in per year average rainy days are around 200 per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2,000. despite high year-round sea level temperatures some higher altitudes such as the andes and mount kilimanjaro sustain glaciers the highest point on the equator is at the elevation of 4,690 metres at 000N 775931W 0.00000N 77.99194W 0.00000 point on the equator found on the southern slopes of volcn cayambe 5,790 metres in ecuador this is slightly above the snow line and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground at the equator the snow line is around 1,000 metres lower than on mount everest and as much as 2,000 metres lower than the highest snow line in the world near the tropic of capricorn on llullaillaco  climate data for macap brazil in south america  month  jan  feb
