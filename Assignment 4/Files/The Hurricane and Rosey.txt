faced the teams of chris jericho and christian and evolution before beginning a long-running feud rivalry with la Rsistance.56 the feud continued for most of 2004, and the hurricane and rosey faced la

themselves a title match at the september pay-per-view Unforgiven.19 during the title match at the event murdoch delivered an elevated ddt on the hurricane outside the ring.20 the ddt caused the
