public broadcast from the marconi factory in chelmsford took place in june 1920. it was sponsored by the daily mails lord northcliffe and featured the famous australian soprano dame nellie melba the melba broadcast caught the peoples imagination and marked a turning point in the british publics attitude to radio.16 however this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications by late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority the general post office was sufficient to lead to a ban on further chelmsford broadcasts.17  but by 1922, the gpo had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests18 and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.19 anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the united states the gpo proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufactures to be known as the british broadcasting company ltd john reith a scottish calvinist was appointed its general manager in december 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.20 the company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of bbc wireless receiving sets from approved manufacturers to this day the bbc aims to follow the reithian directive to educate and entertain.21  from private company towards public service corporation 1923 to 1926edit  the financial arrangements soon proved inadequate set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.22 by mid-1923, discussions between the gpo and the bbc had become deadlocked and the postmaster-general commissioned a review of broadcasting by the sykes committee the committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the bbcs immediate financial distress and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the gpo this was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufactures protection expired the bbcs broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence as was the prohibition on advertising the bbc was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19.00, and required to source all news from external wire services  Mid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration this time by the crawford committee by now the bbc under reiths leadership had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified broadcasting service but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with reith keen that the bbc be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise the recommendations of the crawford committee were published in march the following year and were still under consideration by the gpo when the 1926 general strike broke out in may the strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production and with restrictions on news bulletins waived the bbc suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.23  the crisis placed the bbc in a delicate position on one hand reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the bbc at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the bbc were to step out of line but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently the government was divided on how to handle the bbc but ended up trusting reith whose opposition to the strike mirrored the pms own thus the bbc was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the governments objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing the resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the pm had broadcast to the nation from reiths home using one of reiths sound bites inserted at the last moment or that the bbc had banned broadcasts from the labour party and delayed a peace appeal by the archbishop of canterbury supporters of the strike nicknamed the bbc the bfc for british falsehood company reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from blakes signifying that england had been saved.24  while the bbc tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers jean seaton professor of media history and the official bbc historian has characterised the episode as the invention of propaganda in its british form.23 reith argued that trust gained by impartial news could then be used impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.25  the bbc did well out of the crisis which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting and it was followed by the governments acceptance of the recommendation made by the crawford committee that the british broadcasting company be replaced by a non-commercial crown-chartered organisation the british broadcasting corporation  1927 to 1939edit  television pioneer john logie baird televised the bbcs first drama the man with the flower in his mouth on 14 july 1930, and the first live outside broadcast the derby on 2 june 1931.2627  the british broadcasting corporation came into existence on 1 january 1927, and reith newly knighted was appointed its first director general to represent its purpose and values the new corporation adopted the coat of arms including the motto shall speak peace unto Nation.28  british radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the bbc reith an intensely moralistic executive was in full charge his goal was to broadcast that is best in every department of human knowledge endeavour and achievement the preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.29 reith succeeded in building a high wall against an american-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue there was no paid advertising on the bbc all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets highbrow audiences however greatly enjoyed it.30 at a time when american australian and canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball rugby and hockey the bbc emphasized service for a national rather than a regional audience boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing but the bbc was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games regardless of their popularity.31  bbc versus other mediaedit  george v giving the 1934 royal christmas message on bbc radio the annual message typically chronicles the years major events  the success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the bbc and well established media such as theatres concert halls and the recording industry by 1929, the bbc complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting because they feared it harmed the artist making his material stale and that it the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer on the other hand the bbc was interested in a cooperation with the recording companies who recent years have not been slow to make records of singers orchestras dance bands etc who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless radio plays were so popular that the bbc had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting in and day out manuscripts come in and nearly all go out again through the post with a note saying regret etc.32 in the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at st georges hall langham place by reginald foort who held the official role of bbc staff theatre organist from 1936 to 1938 foort continued to work for the bbc as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following  experimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by john logie baird limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service named the bbc television service started from alexandra palace in 1936, alternating between an improved baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line marconi-emi system the superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year.33  1939 to 2001edit  television broadcasting was suspended from 1 september 1939 to 7 june 1946, during the second world war and it was left to bbc radio broadcasters such as reginald foort to keep the nations spirits up the bbc moved much of its radio operations out of london initially to bristol and then to bedford concerts were broadcast from the corn exchange the trinity chapel in st pauls church bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945 and in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the archbishops of canterbury and york came to st pauls to broadcast to the uk and all parts of the world on the national day of prayer  there was a widely reported urban myth that upon resumption of the bbc television service after the war announcer leslie mitchell started by saying i was saying before we were so rudely interrupted in fact the first person to appear when transmission resumed was jasmine bligh and the words said were afternoon everybody how are you do you remember me jasmine Bligh...34 the european broadcasting union was formed on 12 february 1950, in torquay with the bbc among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.35  bbc television centre at white city west london which opened in 1960 and closed in 2013.  competition to the bbc was introduced in 1955, with the commercial and independently operated television network of itv however the bbc monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 october 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed independent broadcasting authority the uks first independent local radio station lbc came on-air in the london area as a result of the pilkington committee report of 1962, in which the bbc was praised for the quality and range of its output and itv was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,36 the decision was taken to award the bbc a second television channel BBC2, in 1964, renaming the existing service BBC1. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across europe BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 july 1967, and was joined by BBC1 and itv on 15 november 1969. the 405 line vhf transmissions of BBC1 itv were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.  starting in 1964, a series of pirate radio stations with radio caroline came on the air and forced the british government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services in response the bbc reorganised and renamed their radio channels on 30 september 1967, the light programme was split into radio 1 offering continuous music and radio 2 more Listening.37 the programme became radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming the home service became radio 4 offering news and non-musical content such as quiz shows readings dramas and plays as well as the four national channels a series of local bbc radio stations were established in 1967, including radio London.38  in 1969, the bbc enterprises department was formed to exploit bbc brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products in 1979, it became a wholly owned limited company bbc enterprises Ltd.39  in 1974, the bbcs teletext service ceefax was introduced created initially to provide subtitling but developed into a news and information service in 1978, bbc staff went on strike just before the christmas of that year thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.4041  since the deregulation of the uk television and radio market in the 1980s, the bbc has faced increased competition from the commercial sector from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster channel 4, especially on satellite television cable television and digital television servicescitation needed  in the late 1980s, the bbc began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation in 1988, it sold off the hulton press library a photographic archive which had been acquired from the picture post magazine by the bbc in 1957. the archive was sold to brian deutsch and is now owned by getty Images.42 during the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries of the bbc with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making bbc enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as bbc worldwide Ltd.39 in 1998, bbc studios outside broadcasts post production design costumes and wigs were spun off into bbc resources Ltd.43  the bbc research department has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques in the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurementcitation needed the bbc was also responsible for the development of the nicam stereo standard  in recent decades a number

had been a programming strand as childrens bbc since 1985, was split into cbbc and cbeebies for younger children with both new services getting a digital channel the cbbc channel and cbeebies channel in addition to the television channels new digital radio stations were created 1Xtra, 6 music and BBC7. bbc 1Xtra was a sister station to radio 1 and specialised in modern black music bbc 6 music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive speech and childrens programming  the following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand in 2003, bbc choice was replaced by bbc three with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries bbc news 24 became the bbc news channel in 2008, and bbc radio 7 became bbc radio 4 extra in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on radio 4. in 2008, another channel was launched bbc alba a scottish gaelic service  during this decade the

owned subsidiary of the bbc  the 2004 hutton inquiry and the subsequent report raised questions about the bbcs journalistic standards and its impartiality this led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then director general greg dyke in january 2007, the bbc released minutes of the board meeting which led to greg dykes resignation.52  unlike the other departments of the bbc the bbc world service was funded by the foreign and commonwealth office the foreign and commonwealth office more commonly known as the foreign office or the fco is the british government

included a reduction in posts of 2,500 including 1,800 redundancies consolidating news operations reducing programming output by 10 and selling off the flagship television centre building in London.53

6.471billion for british sky broadcasting in 20131473 and 1.843billion for itv in the calendar year 2013.74  revenueedit  see also television licence and television licensing in the united kingdom  the principal means of funding the bbc is through the television licence costing 145.50 per year per household since april 2010. such a licence is required to legally receive broadcast television across the uk the channel islands and the isle of man no licence is required to own a television used for other means or for sound only radio sets a separate licence for these was also required for non-tv households until 1971. the cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law a discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets a 50 discount is also offered to people who are registered blind or severely visually impaired,75 and the licence is completely free for any household containing anyone aged 75 or over as a result of the uk governments recent spending review an agreement has been reached between the government and the corporation in which the current licence fee will remain frozen at the current level until the royal charter is renewed at the beginning of 2017.76  the revenue is collected privatelyclarification needed and is paid into the central government consolidated fund a process defined in the communications act 2003. the bbc pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name licensing tv licensing collection is currently carried out by capita an outside agency funds are then allocated by the department of culture media and sport and the treasury and approved by parliament via legislation additional revenues are paid by the department for work and pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75-year-olds.  the licence fee is classified as a tax,77 and its evasion is a criminal offence since 1991, collection and enforcement of the licence fee has been the responsibility of the bbc in its role as tv licensing Authority.78 thus the bbc is a major prosecuting authority in england and wales and an investigating authority in the uk as a whole the bbc carries out surveillance using subcontractors on properties the auspices of the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 and may conduct searches of a property using a search warrant.79 according to the bbc than 204,000 people in the uk were caught watching tv without a licence during the first six months of 2012.80 licence fee evasion makes up around one tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates courts.81  income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years,82 with bbc worldwide contributing some 145million to the bbcs core public service business  according to the bbcs 201314 annual report its total income was 5 billion billion,2 which can be broken down as follows  3.726 billion in licence fees collected from householders  1.023 billion from the bbcs commercial businesses  244.6million from government grants of which 238.5million is from the foreign and commonwealth office for the bbc world service  72.1million from other income such as rental collections and royalties from overseas broadcasts of programming.2  the licence fee has however attracted criticism it has been argued that in an age of multi stream multi-channel availability an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate the bbcs use of private sector company capita group to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments or do not require a tv licence.83  the bbc uses advertising campaigns to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee past campaigns have been criticised by conservative mp boris johnson and former mp ann widdecombe for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying.8485 audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the bbcs comprehensive database.86 there are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee.87  the majority of the bbcs commercial output comes from its commercial arm bbc worldwide

much funding from the television licence meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on bbc Online.130 some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on bbc online should be reducedeither being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions or a reduction in the amount of content available on the

market and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision example instead of providing local events information and timetables users will be guided to outside websites

the broadcast medium upon which people in the united kingdom relied it into every home in the land and simultaneously united the nation an important factor during the second world War.141 the bbc introduced the worlds first 405-line television service in 1936. it suspended its television service during the second world war and until 1946, but remained the only television broadcaster in the uk until 1955, when independent television began operating.142 this heralded the transformation of television into a popular and dominant medium nevertheless the 1950s radio still remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy.142 further the bbc was the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968 ury obtained their first licence.143  despite the advent of commercial television and radio the bbc has remained one of the main elements in british popular culture through its obligation to produce tv and radio programmes for mass audiences.144145 however the arrival of BBC2 allowed the bbc also to make programmes for minority interests in drama documentaries current affairs entertainment and sport examples cited include the television series civilisation doctor who i claudius monty pythons flying circus pot black and tonight but other examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the bbcs entries in the british film institutes 2000 list of the 100 greatest british television Programmes.146 the export of bbc programmes both through services like the bbc world service and bbc world news as well as through the channels operated by bbc worldwide means that audiences can consume bbc productions worldwide  the term english was used as an alternative name for received pronunciation and the english pronouncing dictionary uses the term pronunciation to label its recommendations.147 however the bbc itself now makes more use of regional accents in order to reflect the diversity of the uk while continuing to expect clarity and fluency of its presenters.148 from its beginnings the bbc has also become more inclusive and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities because they all pay the licence fee.149  competition from independent television channel 4, sky and other broadcast-television stations has lessened the bbcs influence but its public broadcasting remains a major influence on british popular culture.144  attitudes toward the bbc in popular cultureedit  older domestic uk audiences often refer to the bbc as beeb a nickname originally coined by peter sellers on the goon show in the 1950s, when he referred to the beeb ceeb it was then borrowed shortened and popularised by kenny Everett.150 another nickname now less commonly used is said to originate from the old-fashioned knows best attitude or the idea of aunties and uncles who are present in the background of ones life possibly a reference to the and who presented childrens programmes in the early days151 in the days when john reith the bbcs first director general was in charge the two nicknames have also been used together as Beeb.152  criticism and controversiesedit  main articles criticism of the bbc and bbc controversies  the bbc has faced various accusations regarding many topics the iraq war politics ethics and religion as well as funding and staffing it also has been involved in numerous controversies because of its different sometimes controversial coverage of specific news stories and programming in october 2014, the bbc trust issued the complaints framework,153 outlining complaints and appeals procedures however the regulatory oversight of the bbc may be transferred to ofcom the british of commons select committee on culture media and sport recommended in its report future of the BBC,154 that ofcom should become the final arbiter of complaints made about the BBC.155  accusations of a bias against the government and the conservative party were often made against the corporation by members of margaret thatchers 1980s conservative government bbc has long faced accusations of liberal and leftwing bias,156 presenter andrew marr has said that bbc is not impartial or neutral it has a liberal bias not so much a party-political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias while former bbc director roger mosey classified it as defensive.157158159 conversely the bbc has been criticised by the guardian columnist owen jones who has said that truth is the bbc is stacked full of rightwingers.160 paul mason the former economics editor of the bbcs newsnight programme has also criticised the bbc as in relation to the bbcs coverage of the 2014 scottish referendum campaign and however peter sissons a main news presenter at the bbc from 19892009, who from 19641989 worked as a journalist and then senior presenter at itn latterly at channel 4 news says the core of the bbc in its very dna is a way of thinking that is firmly of the Left.162 the bbc has also been characterised as a pro-monarchist institution.163 the bbc was also accused of propaganda by journalist and author toby young due to what he believed to be an anti-brexit approach including a whole day of live programming on migration.164  the bbc world service was involved in the kyrgyz revolution in april 2010. one of the news presenters and a producer of the bbc world service language was revealed to have participated in the opposition movement at the time with the goal to overthrow the kyrgyzstan government led by president kurmanbek bakiyev using bbc resources the bbc producer resigned from his post in 2010 once the news of his participation in the revolution became public the bbc world service neither confirmed nor denied this story nor did the service issue a statement about this story.165
