extremely powerful and catastrophic cape verde-type hurricane the strongest observed in the atlantic since wilma in 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds it was the first Category5 hurricane to strike the leeward islands on record and the costliest caribbean hurricane,1 until hurricane maria only two weeks later it was also the most intense atlantic hurricane to strike the united states since katrina in 2005, and the first major hurricane to make landfall in florida since wilma in 2005. the ninth named storm fourth hurricane second major hurricane and first Category5 hurricane of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime particularly in parts of the northeastern caribbean and the florida keys  irma developed on august 30, 2017 near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west african coast three days prior.234 under favorable conditions irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation becoming a Category2 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale within a mere 24hours. irma became a Category3 hurricane therefore a major hurricane shortly afterward however the intensity fluctuated between Categories2 and 3 for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles on september 4, irma resumed intensifying becoming a Category5 hurricane by early the next day on september 6, irma reached its peak intensity with 185mph winds and a minimum pressure of 914hPa making it the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide so far in 2017, behind only hurricane maria and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed another eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken back to a Category4 hurricane but the storm attained Category5 status for a second time before making landfall in cuba after dropping to Category3 intensity due to land interaction the storm re-intensified to Category4 status as it crossed warm waters between cuba and florida before making landfall on cudjoe key with maximum sustained winds at 130mph irma dropped back to Category3 by the time it made a second florida landfall on marco island irma weakened to a Category2 hurricane later that day the first time it weakened below major hurricane status in over a week and eventually dissipated off the coast of new england on september 16.  the storm caused catastrophic damage in barbuda saint barthlemy saint martin anguilla and the virgin islands as a Category5 hurricane.56 as of october 10, the hurricane has caused at least 134 deaths one in anguilla

the national hurricane center began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa on august 26.7 this wave moved off the coast of the continent late on august 27. throughout the next two days showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low pressure area as the system passed just south of and then through the cape verde islands on august 29,8 with the nhc stating that any significant organization of the disturbance would result in the classification of a tropical depression.9 further organization over the next 24 hours or so led to classification of the disturbance as tropical storm irma at 1500UTC on august 30, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.10 with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear strengthening was anticipated with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air  a viirs satellite image of hurricane irma on September3  the nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow as an anticyclone became established over the system with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.11 early on august 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast and an eye feature irma rapidly intensified beginning at 0900UTC on august 31, with winds increasing from 70mph to 115mph in only 12 hours.12 on september 2, a ship passed 60mi to the west of the center of irma recording maximum winds of 45mph which indicated that the eye of irma remained compact.1314 a strengthening subtropical ridge over the central north atlantic pushed irma from a western to southwestern direction on september 2 and 3.15161718 the first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from barbados on the afternoon of september 3, discovering an eye 29mi in diameter and surface winds of 115mph  infrared loop of hurricane irma approaching the northern leeward islands on september 5, around the time of its upgrade to a Category5 hurricane  on september 4, after moving into more favorable conditions irma strengthened into a Category4 hurricane.20 as it continued approaching the leeward islands irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification becoming a Category5 hurricane by 1145UTC on the following day with winds of 175mph as it began to take on annular characteristics the extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify,22 with maximum sustained winds peaking at 185mph near 0000UTC on september 6 which would remain steady and unchanged for the next 37 hours six hours later irma made landfall along the northern coast of barbuda near peak strength.23 later that day around 2100UTC, the storms pressure bottomed out at 914hPa this was the lowest in the atlantic since dean in 2007. while maintaining its intensity irma made successive landfalls at approximately 1200UTC on sint maarten and at 1700UTC on ginger island and tortola in the british virgin islands  sea surface temperatures in hurricane irmas path  shortly before 0600UTC on september 8, irma made landfall on the bahamian island little Inagua.24 about three hours later an eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken to a Category4 hurricane but the storm regained Category5 status 18 hours later before making landfall in cuba after weakening to a Category3 due to land interaction with cuba irma reintensified into a Category4 hurricane while crossing over the straits of florida at 1310UTC on september 10, irma made landfall in cudjoe key florida with maximum sustained winds of 130mph and a central pressure of 929hPa later that day at 1935UTC, irma made landfall in marco island with maximum sustained winds of 115mph and a central pressure of 940hPa the marco island police department recorded a wind gust of 130mph the naples fl municipal airport measured wind gusts up to 142mph about a half an hour later irma made landfall in naples at the same intensity irma weakened into a category 2 storm once inland and below hurricane intensity at 1200 utc on september 11. at 0300UTC on september 12, irma weakened to a tropical depression over the georgia-alabama border and degenerated into a post-tropical low about 24 hours later north of tupelo Mississippi.27 irmas remnants continued moving towards the northwest over the next day before turning northward and then accelerating to the northeast on september 14.28 early on september 15, irmas remnants began moving off the new england coastline becoming increasingly disorganized while continuing to weaken later on the same day irmas remnants began interacting with a cold front stretching over Newfoundland.29 on september 16, irmas remnant circulation collapsed and the majority of irmas remnant moisture was absorbed into hurricane jose later that day.30  data collected by nasa showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of irma were above 30C at the time more than enough to sustain a category 5 hurricane.31 additionally ocean surface temperatures in areas along the strait of florida extended to 32C which could support a maximum potential intensity of 200 miles per hour if ideal conditions had been met.34  preparations  caribbean  given that irmas forecast track was along much of the caribbean island chain hurricane warnings were issued for the northern leeward islands puerto rico and parts of hispaniola on september 5.35  on september 4, puerto rico declared a state of emergency.36 by september 6, the us federal emergency management agency had deployed response teams in puerto rico and the united states virgin islands supplies including food rations medical supplies and blankets were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.37  in antigua and

for relief efforts on st martin of saint martin and st barts Barthlemy.44  though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island a yellow alert was issued for martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.45 the island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of guadeloupe saint martin and saint barthlemy which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.46 the national emergency management organization on saint lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.47 small craft warnings and high

tourists were moved to santo domingo away from beach resorts.55  in haiti government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts while some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population others they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of irmas approach per the Guardian.5556 local officials contended that they had not received promised funds supplies or equipment from the national government the united nations stabilization mission in haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.57  in the bahamas the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricanes arrival including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.58 by september 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands including 365 from Bimini.59 controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.60 shelters were made available though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.61 of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in the bahamas on september 7, about 1,200 were being housed at atlantis paradise island one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.62  in cuba meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.63 fuel conservation was enacted in camagey province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.64 the civil defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas including thousands of canadian and european tourists in the jardines del Rey.6563 dolphins at a cayo guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.63  mainland united states  florida  play media

utilities.88  by the evening of september 8, hundreds of thousands of floridians had evacuated making it the largest evacuation in the states history.74 evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound interstate 95, interstate 75, and floridas turnpike exacerbated by the fact that the entire florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the national hurricane centers forecast path in the days before the storm so evacuees from both coasts headed north as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.89909192 fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular florida during the week before irmas arrival especially along evacuation routes leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the florida highway

hurricane season was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations the shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.9895  officials from the environmental protection agency which had been criticized for its response to hurricane harvey took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials especially at superfund sites.99  elsewhere  eastbound interstate 4 lanes on the afternoon of september 9 are filled with evacuating traffic from the gulf coast the emergency shoulder use by moving traffic while westbound lanes are almost empty at 5PM on a saturday afternoon  georgia governor nathan deal declared a state of emergency initially for

almost doubled the requested amount to with the understanding that this would only be about 10 of what will be required for responding to Harvey.132  impact  hurricane irmas path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating with confirmed landfalls in antigua and barbuda saint martin anguilla turks and caicos the bahamas cuba and the united states furthermore the size of the

intensity during the night of september 56149 a local anemometer reportedly measured an unofficial gust of 155mph before being blown away.150 though some reports of structural damage such as blown off roofs surfaced shortly after,151 the exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after irmas passage as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.39 later that afternoon prime minister gaston browne surveyed the territory by helicopter revealing an effectively uninhabitable island irma damaged or destroyed 95 of the structures on barbuda including its hospital schools and both of its hotels152 it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.153154 the destruction rendered the islands sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperativeincluding water and telecommunication serviceswhich further hampered relief efforts preliminary assessments on barbuda suggest property damage of at least a total of three storm-related deaths have been reported on the island.136  in addition to the catastrophic impact on barbudas human residents concern turned to the storms effects on the islands wildlife the islands only endemic bird the near-threatened barbuda warbler numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.155 it is unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath.155 barbudas codrington

strongest windfield antigua sustained minimal damage in the form of leveled roofs and fences downed power poles and lines and uprooted trees some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.156 three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.157 forensic disaster analysts from the center for disaster management and risk reduction technology a germany-based risk management agency estimate that economic losses for antigua and barbuda will exceed  saint martin  play media  aerial video of the damage on saint martin september 7, 2017  damaged buildings in sint maarten on september 7, 2017  on the morning of september 6, irmas center crossed the island of saint martin while the storm was near peak intensity sweeping away entire structures submerging roads and cars and triggering an island-wide blackout.158 irmas extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.159 on the french side of saint-martin entire marinas around marigot were left in ruins littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.159 a hotel caught on fire but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.160 media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.159 irma killed four people on the french side of the island and injured 50 others one of whom was in critical condition as many as 95 of the buildings there were damaged to some degree 60 of those were totally uninhabitable.161 estimates from cedim indicate a minimum of worth of economic losses.134 total loses exceeded 3.5billion USD.142  a similar situation unfolded in sint maarten saint martins dutch half as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft if they were matches.162 the hurricane wreaked havoc on princess juliana international airport with chunks of the building across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.163 it demolished or severely damaged about 70 of sint maartens houses forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.164 there were two deaths and 23 injuries 11 of which were serious in the dutch territory.165 irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit sint maarten the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.162 prime minister william marlin estimates that at least 1billion will be necessary to restore the destruction,166 while disaster analysts from cedim predict losses will exceed by september 9, 2017, the death count rose to 4 with one death due to natural causes.167  saint barthlemy  irma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the french island of saint barthlemy southeast of saint martin describing the extent of the destruction one local compared it to bomb that burned all vegetation while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively the island from the map.168 violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.169 streets in the capital of gustavia were turned into rushing rivers which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture the islands fire station was inundated with up to 6.4ft of flood waters.169170 with scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed the majority of the islands population was left stranded and without water electricity or phone service.168 the associated economic losses could exceed according to cedims analysts.134  preliminary assessments from the french government indicate that hurricane irma caused a combined 1.2billion in insured losses across the french territories of saint-martin and saint barts this total covered private property such as homes vehicles and businesses lost revenue171 the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined nonetheless this made irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the french republic in 50 years.171  play media  noaa aircraft flying through the eye of hurricane irma on september 5, 2017  anguilla  the british overseas territory of anguilla had the eye of the storm pass over it on september 6. many homes and schools were destroyed and the islands

lucia blocking some roads seaside roads were inundated with water.175 one surfer was killed amid rough surf in barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck trees were also destroyed.176 the hurricanes effects such as violent seas and rattling trees were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in guadeloupe several houses were damaged.177 around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm leaving several communes in the dark without running water overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.43  saint kitts and nevis endured similar conditions to other islands blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the islands water system but per the international red cross the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.178 still prime minister timothy harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained damage.56 the dutch territories of saba and sint eustatius were also struck by the hurricanes winds resulting in infrastructural damage water shortages and telecommunication outages.173179 several houses were left uninhabitable on saba the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.173179 cedims analysts expect economic losses of for the two islands.134
