seismicearthquake zones.1718 the M5.8 virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout maryland buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage

marylands first colonial settlementedit  main article province of maryland  the catholic george calvert 1st lord baltimore sought a charter from king charles i for the territory between massachusetts to the north and virginia to the immediate south.54 after george calvert died in april 1632, the charter was granted to his son cecilius calvert 2nd baron baltimore on june 20, 1632. officially the new colony was named in honor of henrietta maria of france wife of charles i of England.55 alternatively some catholic scholars and historians believe maryland may have been named after mary the mother of jesus by george calvert 1st lord baltimore prior to his death in 1632. his original intent may never fully be known the specific name given in the charter was phrased terra mariae anglice maryland the english name was preferred due to undesired associations of mariae with the spanish jesuit juan de mariana linked to the inquisition in addition henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name scholars also agree that under no circumstances was a territory ever named after someones middle name many agreewho that since the original capital of maryland was st marys city on the north shore of the potomac river and the county surrounding it the first erectedcreated in the province,56 was named st marys county maryland was most likely named after mary the mother of jesus christ the great seal of maryland also supports this conclusion the obverse side of the seal reads terr MARI,57 which translates in latin as of mary instead of terr maria which would acknowledge henriettas middle name.58  lord baltimores first settlers arrived in the new colony in march 1634, with his younger brother leonard calvert as first provincial governor of maryland they made their first permanent settlement at st marys city in what is now st marys county they purchased the site from the paramount chief of the region who was eager to establish trade st marys became the first capital of maryland and remained so for 60 years until 1695. more settlers soon followed their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable however given the incidence of malaria yellow fever and typhoid life expectancy in maryland was about 10 years less than in new England.59  persecution of catholicsedit  see also plundering time  maryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of englands roman catholic minority.60 in 1642 a number of puritans left virginia for maryland and founded providence called annapolis on the western shore of the upper chesapeake Bay.61 a dispute with traders from virginia over kent island in the chesapeake led to armed conflict in 1644 william claiborne a puritan seized kent island while his associate the pro-parliament puritan richard ingle took over st Marys.62 both used religion as a tool to gain popular support the two years from 16441646 that claiborne and his puritan associates held sway were known as plundering time they captured jesuit priests imprisoned them then sent them back to england  in 1646 leonard calvert returned with troops recaptured st marys city and restored order the house of delegates passed the concerning religion in 1649 granting religious liberty to all trinitarian Christians.59  in 1650 the puritans revolted against the proprietary government swept the catholics out of the legislature religious strife returned.59 the puritans set up a new government prohibiting both roman catholicism and anglicanism the puritan revolutionary government persecuted maryland catholics during its reign known as the time mobs burned down all the original catholic churches of southern maryland the puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the calvert family and lord baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the toleration act  after englands revolution of 1688, maryland outlawed catholicism this lasted until after the american revolutionary war wealthy catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy  border disputes  main articles penncalvert boundary dispute and cresaps war  the royal charter granted maryland the land north of the potomac river up to the 40th parallel a problem arose when charles ii granted a charter for pennsylvania the grant defined pennsylvanias southern border as identical to marylands northern border the 40th parallel but the grant indicated that charles ii and william penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to new castle delaware when it falls north of philadelphia the site of which penn had already selected for his colonys capital city negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.  a compromise proposed by charles ii in 1682 was undermined by penns receiving the additional grant of what is now Delaware.63 penn successfully argued that the maryland charter entitled lord baltimore only to unsettled lands and dutch settlement in delaware predated his charter the dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century carried on by the descendants of william penn and lord baltimore the calvert family which controlled maryland and the penn family which controlled Pennsylvania.63  the border dispute with pennsylvania led to cresaps war in the 1730s. hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade culminating in the deployment of military forces by maryland in 1736 and by pennsylvania in 1737. the armed phase of the conflict ended in may 1738 with the intervention of king george ii who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire a provisional agreement had been established in 1732.63  negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. the agreement defined the border between maryland and pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the masondixon line marylands border with delaware was based on a transpeninsular line and the twelve-mile circle around new Castle.63  18th centuryedit  main article maryland in the american revolution  most of the english colonists arrived in maryland as indentured servants and had to serve a several years term as laborers to pay for their passage.64 in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together and formed unions mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem by which children took the social status of their mothers a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies following virginia in 1662. during the colonial era families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and african men.65  comte du bourg and baron von closen on their way to yorktown september 1781  many of the free black families migrated to delaware where land was cheaper.65 as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england planters in maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened the economys growth and prosperity was based on slave labor devoted first to the production of tobacco as the commodity crop  maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution on february 2, 1781, maryland became
