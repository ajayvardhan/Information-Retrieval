box the top-left corner of the first page the principal section colors are blue for news a green for money b red for sports c and purple for life d in the papers early years the life and money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color as the presses used at usa today printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.29

2012.  in many ways usa today is set up to break the typical newspaper layout some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages31, sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside the lead reefer is the cover page feature which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections as a national newspaper usa today cannot focus on the weather for any one city therefore the entire back page of the news section is used for weather maps for the continental united states puerto rico and the united states virgin islands and temperature lists for many cities throughout the us and the world for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code such as for thunderstorms referencing the expected weather conditions the colorized forecast map originally created by staff designer george rorick left usa today for a similar position at the detroit news in 1986, was copied by newspapers around the world breaking from the traditional style of using

indexes for 36 major us cities 16 cities prior to 1999 with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map are also featured weather data

graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly monthly and weekly movements against the sp 500. on days featuring bonus sections or business holidays the money and life sections are usually combined into one section while combinations of the friday life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks advertising coverage is seen in the monday money section which often includes a review of a current television ad and after super bowl sunday a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ad track live survey stock tables for individual stock exchanges one subsection for companies traded on the new york stock exchange and another for companies trading on nasdaq and the american stock exchange and mutual indexes were

or local newscasts the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers like most national papers usa today does not carry comic strips  usa today is headquartered in tysons corner virginia  one of the staples of the news section is the usa a state-by-state roundup of headlines the summaries consist of paragraph-length associated press reports highlighting one story of note in each state the district of columbia and one us territory similarly the the record page of the sports section features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current days games also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multi-state lotteries  some traditions have been retained however the lead story still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the news section stock and mutual fund data are presented in the money section but usa today is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight even in a mix of other newspapers such as at a newsstand the overall design and layout of usa today has been described as neo-Victorian.38  also in most of the sections front pages on the lower left hand corner are today snapshots which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in example a snapshot in could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time these are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter the example above the graphs bars could be made up of several tv sets or ended by one these are usually loosely based on research by a national institute the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph  the newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called open air which

ideologically diverse.40  usa today has traditionally maintained a policy not to endorse candidates for the united states presidency or any other state or federal political office which it has refrained from doing since its inception since 1984, its political editorials during the presidential election cycle has focused instead on providing opinion on major issues relevant to the campaign based on the differing concerns of voters the vast amount of information on ongoing presidential campaigns and the board of contributors aim to provide a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias however the board re-evaluates its non-endorsement policy through an independent process during each four-year election cycle with any decision to circumvent the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial boards members dissent or hold differing opinions.42  the editorial board broke from this stance for the first time on september 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of republican nominee donald trump calling him for the presidency due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric that aimed at military veterans immigrants and various ethnic and religious groups his temperament and lack of financial transparency his business record his use of false and hyperbolic statements the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy and based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both democrats and republicans on these views the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a trump administration asking voters to the siren song of a dangerous demagogue.43 the board noted that the piece was not a endorsement of democratic nominee hillary clinton for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing editorial board members expressed that clintons public service record would help her the nation ably as its president while others had reservations about sense of entitlement lack of candor and extreme carelessness in handling classified information instead advising voters to decide whether to vote for clinton libertarian nominee gary johnson green party nominee jill stein or a write-in candidate or focus on senate house and other down-ballot political races.444546  personneledit  in may 2012, larry kramer a 40-year media industry veteran and former president of cbs digital media was appointed president and publisher of usa today replacing
