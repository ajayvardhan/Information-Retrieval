salinity is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water also soil salinity this is usually measured in that this is technically dimensionless salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural waters and of biological processes within it and is a thermodynamic state variable that along with temperature and pressure governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water  a contour line of constant salinity is called an isohaline or sometimes isohale  contents  1 definitions  1.1 composition  1.2 seawater

rivers lakes and the ocean is conceptually simple but technically challenging to define and measure precisely conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water salts are compounds like sodium chloride magnesium sulfate potassium nitrate and sodium bicarbonate which dissolve into ions the concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity operationally dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter a filter with a pore size of 0.45 m but nowadays usually 0.2 m.2 salinity can be expressed in the form of a mass fraction ie the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution  seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35gkg, although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities from less than 0.01gkg3 to a few gkg although there are many places where higher salinities are found the dead sea has a salinity of more than 200gkg.4  whatever pore size is used in the definition the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few percent physical oceanographers working in the abyssal ocean however are often concerned with precision and intercomparability of measurements by different researchers at different times to almost five significant digits.5 a bottled seawater product known as iapso standard seawater is used by oceanographers to standardize their measurements with enough precision to meet this requirement  compositionedit  measurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources all from dissolved salts in different molecular forms the chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems to different levels of precision while still remaining reasonably easy to use  for practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of masses of a subset of these dissolved chemical constituents solution salinity rather than to the unknown mass of salts that gave rise to this composition exception is when artificial seawater is created for many purposes this sum can be limited to a set of eight major ions in natural waters,67 although for seawater at highest precision an additional seven minor ions are also included.5 the major ions dominate the inorganic composition of most by no means all natural waters exceptions include some pit lakes and waters from some hydrothermal springs  the concentrations of dissolved gases like oxygen and nitrogen are not usually included in descriptions of salinity.2 however carbon dioxide gas which when dissolved is partially converted into carbonates and bicarbonates is often included silicon in the form of silicic acid which usually appears as a neutral molecule in the ph range of most natural waters may also be included for some purposes when salinitydensity relationships are being investigated  seawateredit  play media  full 3 minute nasa video feb 27,2013 the nasa aquarius instrument aboard argentinas sac-d satellite is designed to measure global sea surface salinity this movie shows salinity patterns as measured by aquarius from december 2011 through december 2012. red colors represent areas of high salinity while blue shades represent areas of low salinity  the term is for oceanographers usually associated with one of a set of specific measurement techniques as the dominant techniques evolve so do different descriptions of salinity the distinctions between these different descriptions are important to physical oceanographers but are obscure and confusing to nonspecialists  salinities were largely measured using titration-based techniques before the 1980s. titration with silver nitrate could be used to determine the concentration of halide ions chlorine and bromine to give a chlorinity the chlorinity was then multiplied by a factor to account for all other constituents the resulting salinities are expressed in units of parts per thousand or  the use of electrical conductivity measurements to estimate the ionic content of seawater led to the development of the scale called the practical salinity scale 1978 salinities measured using PSS-78 do not have units the suffix psu or psu practical salinity unit is sometimes added to PSS-78 measurement values.10  in 2010 a new standard for the properties of seawater called the thermodynamic equation of seawater 2010 was introduced advocating absolute salinity as a replacement for practical salinity and conservative temperature as a replacement for potential temperature.5 this standard includes a new scale called the reference composition salinity scale absolute salinities on this scale are expressed as a mass fraction in grams per kilogram of solution salinities on this scale are determined by combining electrical conductivity measurements with other information that can account for regional changes in the composition of seawater they can also be determined by making direct density measurements  a sample of seawater from most locations with a chlorinity of 19.37ppt will have a knudsen salinity of 35.00ppt, a PSS-78 practical salinity of about 35.0, and a TEOS-10 absolute salinity of about 35.2gkg. the electrical conductivity of this water at a temperature of 15C is 42.9 mScm.511  lakes and riversedit  limnologists and chemists often define salinity in terms of mass of salt per unit volume expressed in units of mg per litre or g per litre.6 it is implied although often not stated that this value applies accurately only at some reference temperature values presented in this way are typically accurate to the order of 1. limnologists also use electrical conductivity or conductivity as a proxy for salinity this measurement may be corrected for temperature effects and is usually expressed in units of scm  a river or lake water with a salinity of around 70mgL will typically have a specific conductivity at 25C of between 80 and 130Scm. the actual ratio depends on the ions present.12 the actual conductivity usually changes by about 2 per degree celsius so the measured conductivity at 5C might only be in the range of 5080Scm.  direct density measurements are also used to estimate salinities particularly in highly saline lakes.4 sometimes density at a specific temperature is used as a proxy for salinity at other times an empirical salinitydensity relationship developed for a particular body of water is used to estimate the salinity of samples from a measured density  water salinity  fresh water  brackish water  saline water  brine  0.05  0.05 3  3 5  5  0.5  0.5 30  30 50

waters are those of the ocean another term for which is euhaline seas the salinity of euhaline seas is 30 to 35. brackish seas or waters have salinity in the range of 0.5 to 29 and metahaline seas from 36 to 40. these waters are all regarded as thalassic because their salinity is derived from the ocean and defined as homoiohaline if salinity does not vary much over time constant the table on the right modified from por follows the system  in contrast to homoiohaline environments are certain poikilohaline environments may also be thalassic in which the salinity variation is biologically significant.15 poikilohaline water salinities may range anywhere from 0.5 to greater than 300. the important characteristic is that these waters tend to vary in salinity over some biologically meaningful range seasonally or on some other roughly comparable time scale put simply these are bodies of water with quite variable salinity  highly saline water from which salts crystallize are about to is referred to as brine  environmental considerationsedit  salinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance influencing the types of organisms that live in a body of water as well salinity influences the kinds of plants that will grow either in a water body or on land fed by a water by a groundwater.16 a plant adapted to saline conditions is called a halophyte a halophyte which is tolerant to residual sodium carbonate salinity are called glasswort or saltwort or barilla plants organisms bacteria that can live in very salty conditions are classified as extremophiles or halophiles specifically an organism that can withstand a wide range of salinities is euryhaline  salt is expensive to remove from water and salt content is an important factor in water use as potability  the degree of salinity in oceans is a driver of the worlds ocean circulation where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at the surface of the ocean produce changes in buoyancy which cause the sinking and rising of water masses changes in the salinity of the oceans are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide in addition during glacial periods the hydrography is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans hence it is difficult in this case to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation  see alsoedit  soil salinity control  desalination  salinometer  fresh water  seawater  sodium adsorption ratio  soil salinity
