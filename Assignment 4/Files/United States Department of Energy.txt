the manhattan project a project to develop the atomic bomb under the eye of the us army corps of engineers after the war in 1946, the atomic energy commission was created to control the future of the project.67 among other nuclear projects the aec produced fabricated uranium fuel cores at locations such as fernald feed materials production center in cincinnati Ohio.8910 in 1974, the aec gave way to the nuclear regulatory commission which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry and the energy research and development administration which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon naval reactor and energy development programscitation needed  the 1973 oil crisis called attention to the need to consolidate energy policy on august 4, 1977, president jimmy carter signed into law the department of energy organization act of 1977 9591, 91Stat.565, enacted August4, 1977, which created the department of Energy.14 the new agency which began operations on october 1, 1977, consolidated the federal energy administration the energy research and development administration the federal power commission and programs of various other agencies former secretary of defense james schlesinger who served under presidents nixon and ford during the vietnam war was appointed as the first secretary  weapon plans stolenedit  main article wen ho lee  in december 1999, the fbi was investigating how china obtained plans for a specific nuclear device wen ho lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from los alamos national laboratory for the peoples republic of china federal officials including then-energy secretary bill richardson publicly named lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime the u s congress held hearings to investigate the department of energys mishandling of his case republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues not the department of Energy.15 all but one of the 59 charges against lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the chinese obtained could not have come from lee lee filed suit and won a million settlement against the federal government and news agencies.16  loan guarantee program of 2005edit  main article loan guarantee  in 2001, american solar challenge was sponsored by the united states department of energy and the national renewable energy Laboratory.17 after the 2005 race the us department of energy discontinued its sponsorship.18  title xvii of energy policy act of 2005 authorizes the doe to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that reduce or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the united states at the time the guarantee is issued.19 in loan guarantees a conditional commitment requires to meet an equity commitment as well as other conditions before the loan guarantee is completed.20  the united states department of energy the nuclear threat initiative the institute of nuclear materials management and the international atomic energy agency partnered to develop and launch the world institute for nuclear security in september 2008. wins is an international non-governmental organization designed to provide a forum to share best practices in strengthening the security and safety of nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities.21  recentedit  on march 28, 2017 a supervisor in the office of international climate and clean energy asked

excerpt from the code of federal regulations in title 10 Energy24  the official seal of the department of energy a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo it is crested by the white head of an eagle atop a white rope both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency in gold appears on a green background  eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the nations increasing demands for energy the sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands the rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities the lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the nations challenge in harnessing the forces  color scheme is derived from nature symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of mans existence the blue field represents air and water green represents mineral resources and the earth itself and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces by invoking this symbolism the color scheme represents the nations commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment  facilitiesedit  this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced

7, 2009, a billion budget request for doe for fiscal year 2010, including billion for the doe office of energy efficiency and renewable energy the budget aims to substantially expand the use of renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure it also makes significant investmentsclarification needed in hybrids and plug-in hybrids in smart grid technologies and in scientific research and innovation.27  as part of the billion economic stimulus package in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, congress provided energy with an additional billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, adding about 75 percent to energys annual budgets most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contractscitation needed for fiscal year 2013, each of the operating units of the department of energy operated with the following budgets28  division  funding billions  nuclear security   energy and environment   science   management   other   total   programs and contractsedit  energy savings performance contractedit  main article energy savings performance contract  energy savings performance contracts are contracts under which a contractor designs constructs and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agencys utility bills the contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings and after the contract ends all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency.29  energy innovation hubsedit  energy innovation hubs are multi-disciplinary meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies.27 the consortium for advanced simulation of light water reactors was the first doe energy innovation hub established in july 2010, for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation solutions for commercial nuclear reactorscitation needed  the 2009 doe budget includes million to fund eight energy innovation hubs each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge two of the eight hubs are included in the eere budget and will focus on integrating smart materials designs and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity another two hubs included in the doe office of science budget were created to tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes yet another hub was made to develop materials to allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions.27  in 2012, the doe awarded million to the ames laboratory to start a new eih the critical materials institute which will focus on improving the supply of rare earth elements which is controlled by China.30  advanced research projects agency-energyedit  see also arpa-e  arpa-e was officially created by the america competes act authored by
