global warming  this page is about the current warming of the earths climate system change can also refer to climate trends at any point in earths history for other uses see global warming  global mean surface-temperature change from 1880 to 2016, relative to the 19511980 mean the black line is the global annual mean and the red line is the five-year local regression line the blue uncertainty bars show a 95 confidence interval  global warming also referred to as climate change is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earths climate system and its related effects.12 multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming.345 many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th century and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of years.6  in 2013, the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report concluded that is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.7 the largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7C to 3.1F in the lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to 4.8C to 8.6F in the highest emissions scenario.8 these findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations9a and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.1112  future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe.1314 anticipated effects include increasing global temperatures rising sea levels changing precipitation and expansion of deserts in the subtropics.15 warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the arctic with the continuing retreat of glaciers permafrost and sea ice other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall16 ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels.1718 because the climate system has a large and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time many of these effects will persist for not only decades or centuries but for tens of thousands of years to come.19  possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction adaptation to its effects building systems resilient to its effects and possible future climate engineering most countries are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change.21 parties to the unfccc have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required22 and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0C compared to pre-industrial levelsb with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5C  public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing a global 2015 pew research center report showed that a median of 54 of all respondents asked consider it very serious problem significant regional differences exist with americans and chinese economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions among the least concerned.25  contents  1 observed temperature changes  1.1 regional trends and short-term fluctuations  1.2 warmest

lowess smooth lines for the temperature anomalies averaged over the earths land area and sea surface temperature anomalies line averaged over the part of the ocean that is free of ice at all times ocean  two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different reconstructions from climate proxies each smoothed on a decadal scale with the instrumental temperature record overlaid in black  in the period from 1880 to 2012, the global average and ocean surface temperature has increased by 0.85 to 1.06 c multiple independently produced datasets confirm.26 in the period from 1906 to 2005, earths average surface temperature rose by 70022738900000000000.740.18C. the rate of warming almost doubled in the last half of that period decade against 70022732199999999990.070.02Cper decade.27 although the popular press often reports the increase of the average near-surface atmospheric temperature as the measure of global warming most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans the rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere.28c  since 1979, the average temperature of the lower troposphere has increased between 0.12 and 0.135C and 0.243Fperdecade, satellite temperature measurements confirm.2930 climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally varying fluctuations such as the medieval warm period and the little ice Age.31  the warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations as documented by many independent scientific groups.32 examples include sea level rise,33 widespread melting of snow and land ice,34 increased heat content of the oceans,32 increased humidity,32 and the earlier timing of spring events,35 eg the flowering of plants.36 the probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero.32  regional trends and short-term fluctuations  temperature increases vary a lot across the globe since 1979, land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures decade against 70022732799999999990.13Cper decade.37 ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.38 since the beginning of industrialisation in the eighteenth century the temperature difference between the hemispheres has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the North.39 in the past one hundred years average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world however arctic temperatures are also highly variable.40 although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than in the southern hemisphere this fact does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to diffuse within as well as between the hemispheres.41  the thermal inertia of the oceans and the slow responses of other indirect effects occasion the climate to take centuries or longer to adjust to past changes in forcings one climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half degree Celsius,42 and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking equilibrium in the climate system one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64 of the committed 2050 surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution.43  global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends and can temporarily mask them the relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009, which has since been dubbed the global warming hiatus by the media and some scientists,44 is an example of such an episode.4546 2015 updates to account for differing methods of measuring ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade.4748  warmest years vs overall trend  sixteen of the seventeen warmest years on record have occurred since 2000.49 while record-breaking years attract considerable public interest individual years are less significant than the overall trend some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to year statistics in particular ocean oscillations such as the el nio southern oscillation can cause temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons unrelated to the overall trend of climate change gavin schmidt stated long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not.50  initial causes of temperature changes forcings  CO2 concentrations over the last 400,000 years  greenhouse effect schematic showing energy flows between space the atmosphere and earths surface energy exchanges are expressed in watts per square metre  main article attribution of recent climate change  by itself the climate system may generate random changes in global temperatures for years to decades at a time but long-term changes emanate only from so-called external forcings.515253 these forcings are to the climate system but not necessarily external to Earth.54 examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere increased concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in earths orbit around the Sun.55  greenhouse gases  main articles greenhouse gas greenhouse effect radiative forcing carbon dioxide in earths atmosphere and earths energy budget  see also list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions and history of climate change science  the greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planets atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface it was proposed by joseph fourier in 1824, discovered in 1860 by john Tyndall,56 was first investigated quantitatively by svante arrhenius in 1896,57 and its scientific description was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by guy stewart Callendar.5859  annual world greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, by sector  percentage share of global cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions between 1751 and 2012 across different regions  on earth an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be about 33C warmer than it would be in their absence.60d without the earths atmosphere the earths average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water.61 the major greenhouse gases are water vapour which causes about 3670 of the greenhouse effect carbon dioxide which causes 926 methane which causes 49 and ozone which causes 37.626364 clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases  human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide according to work published in 2007, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by 36 and 148 respectively since 1750.65 these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores.66676869 less direct geological evidence indicates that CO2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago.70  fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in CO2 from human activity over the past 20 years the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use particularly deforestation.71 another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker production a chemical process which releases CO2.72 estimates of global CO2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion including cement production and gas flaring was 34.8 billion tonnes 0.5 pgc an increase of 54 above emissions in 1990. coal burning was responsible for 43 of the total emissions oil 34, gas 18, cement 4.9 and gas flaring 0.7.73  in may 2013, it was reported that readings for CO2 taken at the worlds primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassed 400 ppm according to professor brian hoskins this is likely the first time CO2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years.7475 monthly global CO2 concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in march 2015, probably for the first time in several million years.76 on 12 november 2015, nasa scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.77  global carbon dioxide emissions by country  over the last three decades of the twentieth century gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions.78 CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.798071 emissions can be attributed to different regions attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty.8182289  emissions scenarios estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic sociological technological and natural developments.83 in most scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century while in a few emissions are reduced.8485 fossil fuel reserves are abundant and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.86 emission scenarios combined with modelling of the carbon cycle have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future using the six ipcc sres scenarios models suggest that by the year 2100, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm.87 this is 90250 above the concentration in the year 1750.  the popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion ie the destruction of stratospheric ozone the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons.8889 although there are a few areas of linkage the relationship between the two is not strong reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect.90  aerosols and soot  ship tracks can be seen as lines in these clouds over the atlantic ocean on the east coast of the united states atmospheric particles from these and other sources could have a large effect on climate through the aerosol indirect effect  global dimming a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the earths surface was observed from 1961 until at least 1990.91 solid and liquid particles known as aerosols produced by volcanoes and human-made pollutants are thought to be the main cause of this dimming they exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight the effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion CO2 and aerosols have partially offset one another in recent decades so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane.92 radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere removal by clouds and precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week while stratospheric aerosols can remain for a few years carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more and as such changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide.93 black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming being estimated at 17 to 20, whereas carbon dioxide contributes 40 to 45 to global warming9495.96  in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation aerosols have indirect effects on the earths radiation budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets a phenomenon known as the twomey effect.97 this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight known as the albrecht effect.98 indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.99  soot may either cool or warm earths climate system depending on whether it is airborne or deposited atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface in isolated areas with high soot production such as rural india as much as 50 of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds.100 when deposited especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface.101 the influences of atmospheric particles including black carbon are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics particularly in asia while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere.102  changes in total solar irradiance and monthly sunspot numbers since the mid-1970s.  contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing of climate change.103 radiative forcing values are for the year 2005, relative to the pre-industrial era the contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing is 5 the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide.104  solar activity  main article solar activity and climate  since 1978, solar irradiance has been measured by satellites.105 these measurements indicate that the suns radiative output has not increased since then so the warming that occurred in the past 40 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth  climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.106 models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity models are however able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings consisting of both human influences and natural forcings  another line of evidence for the suns non-attributability is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the earths atmosphere.107 according to basic physical principles the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere troposphere but cooling of the upper atmosphere stratosphere.108109 if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected.110  variations in earths orbit  main article milankovitch cycles  the tilt of the earths axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years this changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at earths surface.111 during the last few thousand years this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during summer a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century.112113114115 orbital cycles favorable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000 years.116117  feedback  main articles climate change feedback and climate sensitivity  the dark ocean surface reflects only 6 percent of incoming solar radiation instead sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent.118  the climate system includes a range of feedbacks which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing while negative feedbacks reduce it.119  there are a range of feedbacks in the climate system including water vapour changes in ice-albedo and ice cover affect how much the earths surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight clouds and changes in the earths carbon cycle the release of carbon from soil.120 the main negative feedback is the energy the earths surface radiates into space as infrared radiation.121 according to the stefan-boltzmann law if the absolute temperature measured in kelvins doublese radiated energy increases by a factor of 16 to the 4th power.122  feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations other factors being equal a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing.123 uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario more research is needed to understand the role of clouds119 and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections.124  the ipcc projections previously mentioned span the range than 66 probability based on expert judgement125 for the selected emissions scenarios however the ipccs projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty.126 the lower end of the range appears to be better constrained than the upper end.126  an observation based study on future climate change on the soil carbon feedback conducted since 1991 in harvard suggests release of about 190 petagrams of soil carbon the equivalent of the past two decades of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning until 2100 from the top 1-meter of earths soils due to changes in microbial communities under elevated temperatures.127128 climate models do not account for this possible feedback mechanism  climate models  calculations of global warming prepared in or before 2001 from a range of climate models under the sres A2 emissions scenario which assumes no action is taken to reduce emissions and regionally divided economic development  projected change in annual mean surface air temperature from the late 20th century to the middle 21st century based on a medium emissions scenario A1B.129 this scenario assumes that no future policies are adopted to limit greenhouse gas emissions image credit noaa GFDL.130  main article global climate model  a climate model is a representation of the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system.131 such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement temperature clouds and other atmospheric properties ocean temperature salt content and circulation ice cover on land and sea the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere and chemical and biological processes among others  although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the models climate sensitivity for example the uncertainty in ipccs 2007 projections is caused by the use of multiple models126 with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations,132 the use of differing estimates of humanitys future greenhouse gas emissions,126 any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report ie greenhouse gas releases from permafrost.133  the models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes warming or cooling is thus a result not an assumption of the models.134  clouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict improving the models representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research.135 another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle.136137138  models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.55  the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.139 climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century but do not simulate all aspects of climate.140 not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the ipcc observed arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted.141 precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict.142143 since 1990, sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it would.144  observed and expected environmental effects  main article effects of global warming  projections of global mean sea level rise by parris and others.145 probabilities have not been assigned to these projections.146 therefore none of these projections should be interpreted as a estimate of future sea level rise image credit noaa  anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes including sea level rise changes in climate extremes as the number of warm and cold days declines in arctic sea ice extent glacier retreat and greening of the Sahara.147148  during the 21st century glaciers149 and snow cover150 are projected to continue their widespread retreat projections of declines in arctic sea ice vary.151152 recent projections suggest that arctic summers could be ice-free as ice extent less than 1 million square km as early as 20252030.153  is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense without providing a reason for that change detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence.154 detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical ecological and social systems.155  extreme weather  main articles extreme weather and physical impacts of climate change extreme events  see also tropical cyclones and climate change  changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land with most warming at high northern latitudes and least warming over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic Ocean.156  future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions.157 projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events such as heat waves.158  a 2015 study published in nature climate change states  about 18 of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times which in turn primarily results from human influence for 2 c of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40. likewise today about 75 of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming it is the most rare and extreme events for which the largest fraction is anthropogenic and that contribution increases nonlinearly with further warming.159160  data analysis of extreme events from 1960 until 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency.161 extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since 1980.162  sea level rise  map of the earth with a six-metre sea level rise represented in red  main articles sea level rise and retreat of glaciers since 1850  sparse records indicate that glaciers have been retreating since the early 1800s. in the 1950s measurements began that allow the monitoring of glacial mass balance reported to the world glacier monitoring service and the national snow and ice data center  the sea level rise since 1993 has been estimated to have been on average 2.6mm and 2.9mm per year 0.4mm. additionally sea level rise has accelerated from 1995 to 2015.163 over the 21st century the ipcc projects for a high emissions scenario that global mean sea level could rise by 5298cm.164 the ipccs projections are conservative and may underestimate future sea level rise.165 other estimates suggest that for the same period global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m relative to mean sea level in 1992.145  widespread coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia.166 for example sustained global warming of more than 2C to pre-industrial levels could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice caps.166 melting of the greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5m over many thousands of years.166 it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 metres for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years.167  warming beyond the 2C target would potentially lead to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from antarctica continued CO2 emissions from fossil sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise over the next millennia and eventually ultimately eliminate the entire antarctic ice sheet causing about 58 metres of sea level rise.168  ecological systems  main article climate change and ecosystems  as the climate change melts sea ice the us geological survey projects that two-thirds of polar bears will disappear by 2050.169  in terrestrial ecosystems the earlier timing of spring events as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges have been linked with high confidence to recent warming.170 future climate change is expected to affect particular ecosystems including tundra mangroves coral reefs,156 and caves.171 it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric CO2 levels combined with higher global temperatures.172 overall it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.173  increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to an increase in ocean acidity.174 dissolved CO2 increases ocean acidity measured by lower ph values.174 between 1750 and 2000, surface-ocean ph has decreased by 0.1, from 8.2 to 8.1.175 surface-ocean ph has probably not been below 8.1 during the past 2 million years.175 projections suggest that surface-ocean ph could decrease by an additional 0.30.4 units by 2100.176 future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs fisheries protected species and other natural resources of value to society.174177  ocean deoxygenation is projected to increase hypoxia by 10, and triple suboxic waters concentrations 98 less than the mean surface concentrations for each 1C of upper ocean warming.178  long-term effects  main article long-term effects of global warming  on the timescale of centuries to millennia the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO2 emissions.179 this is due to carbon dioxides very long lifetime in the atmosphere.179  stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in CO2 emissions,179 as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.179180 emissions of CO2 would need to be reduced by more than 80 relative to their peak level.179 even if this were achieved global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries.179 as of 2016, emissions of CO2 from burning fossil fuels had stopped increasing but the guardian reports they need to be to have a real impact on climate change meanwhile this greenhouse gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere.181 in that context the new york times reported that scientific installations analyzing oceanic air detected the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the highest rate on record in 2015 and 2016.182 it hs been suggested that this rise in CO2 levels is the result of changing absorption patterns of the ocean and land surface in that they may have reached the limit of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide.182  also CO2 is not the only factor driving climate change concentrations of atmospheric methane another greenhouse gas rose dramatically between 20062016 for unknown reasons this undermines efforts to combat global warming and there is a risk of an uncontrollable runaway greenhouse effect.183  long-term effects also include a response from the earths crust due to ice melting and deglaciation in a process called post-glacial rebound when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice this could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates.184 some world regions such as the french alps already show signs of an increase in landslide frequency.185  large-scale and abrupt impacts  main article abrupt climate change  see also cold blob atlantic  climate change could result in global large-scale changes in natural and social systems.186 examples include the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow- or shutdown which in the instance of a shutdown would change weather in europe and north america considerably ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and the long-term melting of ice sheets which contributes to sea level rise.187  some large-scale changes could occur abruptly ie over a short time period and might also be irreversible examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost which would lead to amplified global warming or the shutdown of thermohaline circulation.188189 scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor.190 the probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low.188191 factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming warming that occurs more rapidly and warming that is sustained over longer time periods.191  observed and expected effects on social systems  further information effects of global warming social systems and regional effects of global warming regional impacts  see also climate change and national security  the effects of climate change on human systems mostly due to warming or shifts in precipitation patterns or both have been detected worldwide production of wheat and maize globally has been impacted by climate change while crop production has increased in some mid-latitude regions such as the uk and northeast china economic losses due to extreme weather events have increased globally there has been a shift from cold- to heat-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming livelihoods of indigenous peoples of the arctic have been altered by climate change and there is emerging evidence of climate change impacts on livelihoods of indigenous peoples in other regions regional impacts of climate change are now observable at more locations than before on all continents and across ocean regions.192  the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven.193 many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming.194 all regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts.195 low-latitude less developed areas face the greatest risk.196 a study from 2015 concluded that economic growth domestic product of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming than previously thought.197  a meta-analysis of 56 studies concluded in 2014 that each degree of temperature rise will increase violence by up to 20, which includes fist fights violent crimes civil unrest or wars.198  examples of impacts include  food crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude countries while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative.199 global warming of around 4.6C relative to pre-industrial levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security.200  health generally impacts will be more negative than positive.201202203 impacts include the effects of extreme weather leading to injury and loss

solutions and change each pathway shows how various measures improved energy efficiency increased use of renewable energy could contribute to emissions reductions image credit pbl netherlands environmental assessment Agency.211  mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb ghgs from the atmosphere.212 there is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency the use of low-carbon energy technologies such as renewable energy nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage213214 and enhancing carbon sinks through for example reforestation and preventing deforestation.213214 a 2015 report by citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield positive return on investments.215  near- and long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2C, relative to pre-industrial levels.216217 pledges made as part of the cancn agreements are broadly consistent with having a likely chance to 100 probability of limiting global warming the 21st century at below 3C, relative to pre-industrial levels.217  in limiting warming at below 2C, more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030.218 many integrated models are unable to meet the 2C target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies.219  adaptation  main article adaptation to global warming  other policy responses include adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change may be planned either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change or spontaneous ie without government intervention.220 planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis.213 the barriers limits and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood.213  a concept related to adaptation is adaptive capacity which is the ability of a system natural or managed to adjust to climate change climate variability and extremes to moderate potential damages to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with consequences.221 unmitigated climate change future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt.222  environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.223  climate engineering  main article climate engineering  climate engineering called geoengineering or climate intervention is the deliberate modification of the climate it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming eg by NASA224 and the royal Society.225 techniques under research fall generally into the categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal although various other schemes have been suggested a study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.226  discourse about global warming  political discussion  main article politics of global warming  further information 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015 sessions of united nations climate change conference  article 2 of the un framework convention refers explicitly to of greenhouse gas concentrations.227 to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of co  2, emissions worldwide would need to be dramatically reduced from their present level.228  most countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change the ultimate objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.230 as stated in the convention this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.231 the framework convention was agreed on in 1992, but global emissions have risen since then.232  during negotiations the G77 lobbying group in the united nations representing 133 developing nations2334 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to the lead in reducing their emissions.234 this was justified on the basis that the developed worlds emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of ghgs in the atmosphere per-capita emissions emissions per head of population were still relatively low in developing countries and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.82290  this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework Convention,82290 which entered into legal effect in 2005.235 in ratifying the kyoto protocol most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions these first-round commitments expired in 2012.235 united states president george w bush rejected the treaty on the basis that exempts 80 of the world including major population centres such as china and india from compliance and would cause serious harm to the us economy.2335  at the 15th unfccc conference of the parties held in 2009 at copenhagen several unfccc parties produced the copenhagen Accord.236237 parties associated with the accord countries as of november 20102389 aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below 70022751499999999992C.239 the 16th conference of the parties was held at cancn in 2010. it produced an agreement not a binding treaty that the parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to 70022751499999999992C above pre-industrial temperatures it also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of 70022746499999999991.5C.240  scientific discussion  see also scientific opinion on climate change and surveys of scientists views on climate change  the discussion continues in scientific articles that are peer-reviewed and assessed by scientists who work in the relevant fields and participate in the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientific consensus as of 2013 stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.241 a 2008 report by the us national academy of sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.79 in 2005 the royal society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had tried to undermine the science and work of the IPCC.242 national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions.243  in the scientific literature there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.244 no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.245246  discussion by the public and in popular media  main articles climate change denial global warming controversy and media coverage of climate change  global warming was the cover story in this 2007 issue of ms magazine  the global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature,247248 regarding the nature causes and consequences of global warming the disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature especially since the mid-20th century whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations whether humankind has contributed significantly to it and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity predictions of additional warming and what the consequences of global warming will be  by 1990, american conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem they challenged the scientific evidence argued that global warming would have benefits and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good.249 some people dispute aspects of climate change science.242250 organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute conservative commentators and some companies such as exxonmobil have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls.251252253254 on the other hand some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years,255 or even called for policies to reduce global warming.256 global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels.257  surveys of public opinion  main article public opinion on climate change  the global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s. polling groups began to track opinions on the subject at first mainly in the united States.258 the longest consistent polling by gallup in the us found relatively small deviations of 10 or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned.259  the first major worldwide poll conducted by gallup in 20082009 in 127 countries found that some 62 of people worldwide said they knew about global warming in the advanced countries of north america europe and japan 90 or more knew about it in the us 99 in japan in less developed countries especially in africa fewer than a quarter knew about it although many had noticed local weather changes among those who knew about global warming there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.260  by 2010, with 111 countries surveyed gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 20072008 in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat in the us just a little over half the population viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families this was 10 points below the 2008 poll latin america had the biggest rise in concern 73 said global warming was a serious threat to their families.261 this global poll also found that people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes except in the us where nearly half of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.262  a marchmay 2013 survey by pew research center for the people the press polled 39 countries about global threats according to 54 of those questioned global warming featured top of the perceived global threats.263 in a january 2013 survey pew found that 69 of americans say there is solid evidence that the earths average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades up six points since november 2011 and 12 points since 2009.264  a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia norway new zealand and the united states in that order correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon dioxide.265  etymology  in the 1950s, research suggested increasing temperatures and a 1952 newspaper reported change this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in the hammond times which described roger revelles research into the effects of increasing human-caused CO2 emissions on the greenhouse effect large scale global warming with radical climate changes may result both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975, when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming the phrase began to come into common use and in 1976 mikhail budykos statement that global warming up has started was widely reported.266 other studies such as a 1971 mit report referred to the human impact as climate modification but an influential 1979 national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures while describing the wider effects of increased CO2 as climate change.267  in 1986 and november 1987, nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest.268 he said warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.269 public attention increased over the summer and global warming became the dominant popular term commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.267  in a 2008 nasa article on usage erik m conway defined global warming as increase in earths average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases while climate change was long-term change in the earths climate or of a region on earth as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term and like the intergovernmental panel on climate change the nasa website would emphasize this wider context.267  see also  global warming portal  science portal  book global warming  anthropocene  climate change and agriculture  effects of global warming on oceans  environmental impact of the

has already experienced almost 12 of the 2.0C described in the cancn agreement in the last 100 years earths average surface temperature increased by about 0.8C with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.23  scientific journals use warming to describe an increasing global average temperature just at earths surface and most of these authorities further limit warming to such increases caused by human activities or increasing greenhouse gases  the greenhouse effect produces an average worldwide temperature increase of about 33C compared to black body predictions without the greenhouse effect not an average surface temperature of 33C the average worldwide surface temperature is about 14C  a rise in temperature from 10 c to 20 c is not a doubling of absolute temperature a rise from 10 k 283 k to 20 k 293 k is an increase of 3.5.  citations  gillis justin answers to hard questions about climate change the new york times ISSN0362-4331. retrieved
