yucatn mexico  part of the 1966 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane inez was a major hurricanenb 1 that affected the caribbean bahamas florida and mexico in 1966. it was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas it originated from a tropical wave over africa and became a tropical depression by September21. it moved slowly westward initially failing to intensify much it was upgraded to tropical storm inez on September24. the storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the french overseas region of guadeloupe on September27. inez severely damaged the islands banana and sugar crops and thousands of homes were damaged leaving 10,000people homeless damage on guadeloupe was estimated at 2 and there were 40deaths. after entering the caribbean inez briefly weakened before restrengthening attaining peak sustained winds of 150mph on September28. that day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of 197mph which was the highest recorded at the time  continuing westward inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the barahona peninsula of the dominican republic there the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. nationwide there were about 100deaths and in damage after affecting the country inez struck southwestern haiti where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. as many as 1,000people were killed and 60,000people were left homeless damage totaled in haiti prompting the united states government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds inez weakened quickly over hispaniola although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern cuba on September30. in the country 125,000people were forced to evacuate and there were three deaths and in damage  the hurricane moved slowly over cuba for two days before emerging into the atlantic ocean near the bahamas it was expected to continue out to sea although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path in the bahamas heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding which killed five people and left in damage hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the florida keys where 160homes and 190trailers were damaged salt spray damaged crops in the region and there was in damage and four deaths in the straits of florida inez capsized a boat of cuban refugees killing 45people. in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig killing 11people. the hurricane threatened the northern yucatn peninsula and although it remained offshore inez produced flooding and caused some power outages at its final landfall inez flooded portions of tamaulipas and cut off roads to tampico about 84,000people were left homeless and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500houses. damage was estimated at and there were 74deaths in mexico  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  3.1 caribbean and bahamas  3.2 united states  3.3 mexico  4 aftermath  5 see also  6 notes  7 references  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of inez were from a tropical wave that formed over the sahara in central africa on September15 from the monsoon it moved westward in the prevailing winds exiting the west coast of africa on September18. the precursor to inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave,2 which was considered a tropical depression by September18 in the annual tropical cyclone summary tracked by satellites the system moved to the west-southwest,3 and was officially classified a tropical depression on September21 about halfway between the lesser antilles and Africa.4 the system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest a hurricane hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system prompting the national hurricane center to initiate advisories on tropical storm inez located about 800mi east of Martinique.3 with warm water temperatures the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center.2 inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified,3 reaching hurricane status on September26.4  on September27, inez strengthened to reach winds of 120mph making it a Category3 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale.4 later that day it moved directly over the island of guadeloupe at the time inez was a small cyclone with hurricane-force winds extending 50mi from the center3 meteorologists labeled it as a because of its characteristic small tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind.2 its structure became disrupted by the island and the central pressure rose from 961mbar to 970mbar indicative of weakening however inez re-intensified after entering the eastern caribbean sea reaching a minimum pressure of 929mbar south of puerto rico on September28. the hurricane hunters reported sustained winds of 197mph at a height of 8,000ft the strongest winds recorded for the storm the same flight estimated surface winds between 150 to 175mph to 282kmh near the center.3 the peak intensity listed in the atlantic hurricane database is 150mph making inez a strong category 4 hurricane.4  this weather radar image of hurricane inez was taken on september 29, 1966 at 0127 utc  while near peak intensity inez was located about 160mi southwest of san juan puerto rico and the eye was tracked by radar from the island its increasing outflow caused tropical storm judith to the east over the central atlantic to dissipate on September29, the small but powerful hurricane made landfall on the barahona peninsula and quickly weakened over land it briefly moved offshore and struck the southern peninsula of haiti near jacmel the eye emerged into the windward passage near logne although severely weakened the pressure rose to 987mbar and the winds decreased to 90mph over land however inez quickly re-intensified over water reaching winds of 115mph on September30 before striking southeastern cuba near guantnamo Bay.4 when inez was over cuba forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storms future it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the united states due to a weakness in the ridge to the north the hurricane drifted west-northwestward within light steering currents weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of cuba while over water the eye reorganized and the cyclone maintained hurricane intensity inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central cuba and emerged into the atlantic ocean on October2.3  hurricane inez near yucatn peninsula  shortly after exiting cuba into the atlantic inez weakened into a tropical storm and was moving northeastward through the bahamas about 24hours later than forecast.3 at the time the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the bermuda high.2 with little outflow and a large diffuse circulation inez did not restrengthen much despite otherwise favorable conditions,3 potentially due to a nearby trough.2 the movement slowed and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that probably became nearly stationary closer to the united states mainland than any other storm on October3, inez turned to the west-southwest as another ridge strengthened over the western gulf of mexico over the subsequent few days the eye moved directly over the florida keys from key largo to key west and continued through the gulf of mexico while slowly intensifying on October7, inez brushed the northern coast of the yucatn peninsula with hurricane-force winds by then the ridge had begun to weaken allowing the hurricane to turn more west-northwestward.3 on October8, inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140mph with a pressure of 948mbar briefly threatening the coastline of texas inez turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened on October10, the hurricane made its final landfall near tampico tamaulipas in northeastern mexico it weakened rapidly over the regions high terrain dissipating on October11.3  the unusual track of inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the lesser and greater antilles bahamas florida and Mexico.3 the associated press described inez as the to strike the yucatn peninsula in many years.5 it was also the first to move across the gulf of mexico without turning to the north so late in the season and the 65advisories issued by the nhc was the highest number at the time the path taken by inez was compared to hurricane betsy in 1965, which also slowed and moved erratically due to a strong ridge.3 forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane because of its unusual path as well as the inability to fly the hurricane hunters into inez while it was over Cuba.6  preparationsedit  in guadeloupe which was the first area the hurricane affected residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters pan american world airways canceled flights to the region.7 when inez was near peak intensity the nhc warned residents in southern haiti and the dominican republic of the danger posed by the hurricane the agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track in general hurricane warnings were issued 24hours in advance with the exception of southeastern florida due to the hurricanes slowing track.3 overall 250,000people evacuated along the path of Inez.8 at guantnamo bay officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters large ships at the port there were moved to jamaica before the storm struck.9 throughout eastern cuba premier fidel castro ordered about 125,000people to evacuate in low-lying areas mostly in oriente Province.10 united states air force tracking stations in the bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations residents in the florida keys boarded up windows and store fronts,11 and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in key west in southeastern florida government offices and schools closed.12  along the yucatn peninsula about 15,000people were evacuated from the coastal city of Progreso,5 in a region that seldom experiences hurricanes.13 in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after evacuating workers from an oil platform about 65mi south-southwest of morgan city louisiana in otherwise calm conditions 11people died including the pilot.14 when inez was approaching its final landfall the united states weather bureau issued hurricane warnings from brownsville to port isabel texas with gale warnings northward to corpus christi at least 2,000people evacuated from port isabel alone,15 and many shrimp boats were secured.16 in the tampico area where inez made its final landfall over 31,000people evacuated to higher grounds.17  impactedit  satellite image of inez near peak intensity in the caribbean  overall hurricane inez killed about 1,000people, mostly on hispaniola and caused over in damage crop damage was less than other storms of similar magnitude due to inezs small size and its occurrence late in the season.3  caribbean and bahamasedit  when inez struck guadeloupe a station on the island reported sustained winds of 80mph with gusts to 94mph before communications failed rain on the island reached 6.5in the high winds destroyed the roofs of thousands of houses leaving 10,000people homeless there was heavy damage to both the banana and sugar crops described as by the st petersburg Times.18 the

and high winds damaged 20houses.20  hurricane inez struck the dominican republic near peak intensity.3 along the barahona peninsula more than 800homes were destroyed and nationwide about 5,000people were left homeless there was heavy damage to the countrys cotton industry,21 as well as the coffee sugar cane and cocoa crops along the barahona peninsula in the capital city of santo domingo heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the ozama river forcing thousands to evacuate.18 high seas there damaged a portion of a seawall many rivers along the barahona peninsula were also flooded.19 throughout the country inez killed about 100people,3 including 55 in Juancho,21 and left in damage.3  in neighboring haiti high winds downed power lines and radio towers which cut outside communication high rainfall led to flash flooding between mountain ranges,21 in a location nicknamed the of death there the weather bureau remarked that winds may well have exceeded 160mph thousands of homes were either destroyed or lost their roof.19 the haitian government reported over 1,000deaths in the weeks after the storm the united states government reported that the hurricane no more than 50 in haiti and was there a real emergency due to president franois duvalier misusing previous aid.23 the us assessment was incorrect as the 1966 annual tropical cyclone summary in the monthly weather review indicated 750deaths in Haiti,3 mostly in jacmel president duvalier considered the hurricane the storm since the 1920s.11 in the country 1,000people were injured and 60,000 were left homeless and damage was estimated at throughout hispaniola about 1,500people were seriously injured and many people were still recovering from hurricane flora in 1963.22  a station at guantnamo bay reported
