t  e  mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration change in its state of motion when a net force is applied.1 it also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies the basic si unit of mass is the kilogram  in physics mass is not the same as weight even though mass is often determined by measuring the objects weight using a spring scale rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses an object on the moon would weigh less than it does on earth because of the lower gravity but it would still have the same mass this is because weight is a force while mass is the property that with gravity determines the strength of this force  in newtonian physics mass can be generalized as the amount of matter in an object however at very high speeds special relativity states that the kinetic energy of its motion becomes a significant additional source of mass thus any stationary body having mass has an equivalent amount of energy and all forms of energy resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction in modern physics matter is not a fundamental concept because its definition has proven elusive  there are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass although some theorists have speculated that some of these phenomena could be independent of each other,2 current experiments have found no difference in results regardless of how it is measured  inertial mass measures an objects resistance to being accelerated by a force by the relationship f ma  active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted by an object  passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted on an object in a known gravitational field  the mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force the inertia and the inertial mass describe the same properties of physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively by other words the mass quantitatively describes the inertia according to newtons second law of motion if a body of fixed mass m is subjected to a single force f its acceleration a is given by fm a bodys mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational field if a first body of mass ma is placed at a distance r of mass to center of mass from a second body of mass mb each body is subject to an attractive force fg GmAmBr2, where g 69896670000000000006.671011N kg2 m2 is the gravitational constant this is sometimes referred to as gravitational massnote 1 repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical since 1915, this observation has been entailed

notes  10 references  11 external links  units of massedit  further information orders of magnitude  the kilogram is one of the seven si base units and one of three which is defined ad hoc without reference to another base unit  the standard international system of units unit of mass is the kilogram the kilogram is 1000grams first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the melting point of ice then in 1889, the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the international prototype kilogram and as such is independent of the meter or the properties of water however the mass of the international prototype and its identical national copies have been found to be drifting over time it is expected that the re-definition of the kilogram and several other units will change on may 20, 2019, following a final vote by the cgpm in november 2018.3 the new definition will use only invariant quantities of nature the speed of light the caesium hyperfine frequency and the planck constant.4  other units are accepted for use in si  the tonne ton is equal to 1000kg.  the electronvolt is a unit of energy but because of the massenergy equivalence it can easily be converted to a unit of mass and is often used like one in this context the mass has units of eVc2 c is the speed of light the electronvolt and its multiples such as the mev are commonly used in particle physics  the atomic mass unit is 112 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom approximately 69731660000000000001.661027kg.note 2 the atomic mass unit is convenient for expressing the masses of atoms and molecules  outside the si system other units of mass include  the slug is an imperial unit of mass 14.6kg.  the pound is a unit of both mass and force used mainly in the united states 0.45kg or 4.5N. in scientific contexts where pound and pound need to be distinguished si units are usually used instead  the planck mass is the maximum mass of point particles 69922180000000000002.18108kg. it is used in particle physics  the solar mass is defined as the mass of the sun it is primarily used in astronomy to compare large masses such as stars or galaxies  the mass of a very small particle may be identified by its inverse compton wavelength 69593520000000000003.521041kg.  the mass of a very large star or black hole may be identified with its schwarzschild radius 70246730000000000006.731024kg.  definitions of massedit  the relation between properties of mass and their associated physical constants every massive object is believed to exhibit all five properties however due to extremely large or extremely small constants it is generally impossible to verify more than two or three properties for any object  the schwarzschild radius represents the ability of mass to cause curvature in space and time  the standard gravitational parameter represents the ability of a massive body to exert newtonian gravitational forces on other bodies  inertial mass represents the newtonian response of mass to forces  rest energy represents the ability of mass to be converted into other forms of energy  the compton wavelength represents the quantum response of mass to local geometry  in physical science one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of mass or seven physical notions that involve the concept of mass.5 every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be proportional and in some cases equal and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass there are a number of ways mass can be measured or operationally defined  inertial mass is a measure of an objects resistance to acceleration when a force is applied it is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force an object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force one says the body of greater mass has greater inertia  active gravitational massnote 3 is a measure of the strength of an objects gravitational flux flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small object to fall freely and measuring its free-fall acceleration for example an object in free fall near the moon is subject to a smaller gravitational field and hence accelerates more slowly than the same object would if it were in free fall near the earth the gravitational field near the moon is weaker because the moon has less active gravitational mass  passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an objects interaction with a gravitational field passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an objects weight by its free-fall acceleration two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration however the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force weight than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass  energy also has mass according to the principle of massenergy equivalence this equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including pair production nuclear fusion and the gravitational bending of light pair production and nuclear fusion are processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to energy or vice versa in the gravitational bending of light photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass  curvature of spacetime is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass such curvature is extremely weak and difficult to measure for this reason curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by einsteins theory of general relativity extremely precise atomic clocks on the surface of the earth for example are found to measure less time slower when compared to similar clocks in space this difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called gravitational time dilation other forms of curvature have been measured using the gravity probe b satellite  quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an objects quantum frequency and its wave number the quantum mass of an electron the compton wavelength can be determined through various forms of spectroscopy and is closely related to the rydberg constant the bohr radius and the classical electron radius the quantum mass of larger objects can be directly measured using a watt balance in relativistic quantum mechanics mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the poincar group  weight vs massedit  main article mass versus weight  in everyday usage mass and are often used interchangeably for instance a persons weight may be stated as 75kg. in a constant gravitational field the weight of an object is proportional to its mass and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts but because of slight differences in the strength of the earths gravitational field at different places the distinction becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent and for places far from the surface of the earth such as in space or on other planets conceptually in kilograms refers to an intrinsic property of an object whereas in newtons measures an objects resistance to deviating from its natural course of free fall which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field no matter how strong the gravitational field objects in free fall are weightless though they still have mass.6  the force known as is proportional to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall for example when a body is at rest in a gravitational field than in free fall it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the earth or the moon this force keeps the object from going into free fall weight is the opposing force in such circumstances and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall on the surface of the earth for example an object with a mass of 50kilograms weighs 491 newtons which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall by contrast on the surface of the moon the same object still has a mass of 50kilograms but weighs only 81.5newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon restated in mathematical terms on the surface of the earth the weight w of an object is related to its mass m by w mg where g 70009806650000000009.80665ms2 is the acceleration due to earths gravitational field as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object  for other situations such as when objects are subjected to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall which is called the proper acceleration through such mechanisms objects in elevators vehicles centrifuges and the like may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects resulting from planetary surfaces in such cases the generalized equation for weight w of an object is related to its mass m by the equation w ma where a is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity if gravity is the only influence such as occurs when an object falls freely its weight will be zero  macroscopically mass is associated with matter although matter is not ultimately as clearly defined a concept as mass on the subatomic scale not only fermions the particles often associated with matter but also some bosons the particles that act as force carriers have rest mass another problem for easy definition is that much of the rest mass of ordinary matter derives from the binding energy energy holding their quarks together and other forms of energy rather than the sum of the rest masses of the individual particle constituents for example only 1 of the rest mass of matter is accounted for by the rest mass of its elementary quarks and electrons from a fundamental physics perspective mass is the number describing under which the representation of the little group of the poincar group a particle transforms in the standard model of particle physics this symmetry is described as arising as a consequence of a coupling of particles with rest mass to a postulated additional field known as the higgs field  the total mass of the observable universe is estimated at 1053kg,7 corresponding to the rest mass of between 1079 and 1080 protonscitation needed  inertial vs gravitational massedit  although inertial mass passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them in classical mechanics newtons third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical at least proportional but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass that it does is merely an empirical fact  albert einstein developed his general theory of relativity starting from the assumption that this correspondence between inertial and gravitational mass is not accidental that no experiment will ever detect a difference between them weak version of the equivalence principle however in the resulting theory gravitation is not a force and thus not subject to newtons third law so equality of inertial and active gravitational mass remains as puzzling as ever.8  the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is sometimes referred to as the equivalence principle or the equivalence principle the most important consequence of this equivalence principle applies to freely falling objects suppose we have an object with inertial and gravitational masses m and m respectively if the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field g combining newtons second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration  this says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant k if and only if all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field this phenomenon is referred to as the of free-fall addition the constant k can be taken to be 1 by defining our units appropriately  the first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall were conducted by galileo it is commonly stated that galileo obtained his results by dropping objects from the leaning tower of pisa but this is most likely apocryphal actually he performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless inclined planes to slow the motion and increase the timing accuracy increasingly precise experiments have been performed such as those performed by lornd Etvs,9 using the torsion balance pendulum in 1889. as of 2008update, no deviation from universality and thus from galilean equivalence has ever been found at least to the precision 1012. more precise experimental efforts are still being carried out  the universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force all other forces especially friction and air resistance must be absent or at least negligible for example if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on earth the feather will take much longer to reach the ground the feather is not really in free-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity on the other hand if the experiment is performed in a vacuum in which there is no air resistance the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time the acceleration of both objects towards each other and of the ground towards both objects for its own part is negligible this can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump it is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum as david scott did on the surface of the moon during apollo 15.  a stronger version of the equivalence principle known as the einstein equivalence principle or the strong equivalence principle lies at the heart of the general theory of relativity einsteins equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of space-time it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field thus the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the objects tendency to move in a straight line other words its inertia and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field  origin of massedit  main article mass generation mechanism  in theoretical physics a mass generation mechanism is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics to date a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views of the origin of mass the problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the gravitational interaction but a theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model of particle physics known as the standard model  pre-newtonian conceptsedit  weight as an amountedit  main article weight  depiction of early balance scales in the papyrus of hunefer to the 19th dynasty ca 1285 bc the scene shows anubis weighing the heart of hunefer  the concept of amount is very old and predates recorded history humans at some early era realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was directly proportional to the number of objects in the collection  where w is the weight of the collection of similar objects and n is the number of objects in the collection proportionality by definition implies that two values have a constant ratio  or equivalently  an early use of this relationship is a balance scale which balances the force of one objects weight against the force of another objects weight the two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields hence if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar this allows the scale by comparing weights to also compare masses  consequently historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts the romans for example used the carob seed or siliqua as a measurement standard if an objects weight was equivalent to 1728 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one roman pound if on the other hand the objects weight was equivalent to 144 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one roman ounce the roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard the carob seed the ratio of a roman ounce carob seeds to a roman pound carob seeds was  planetary motionedit  see also keplers laws of planetary motion  in 1600 ad johannes kepler sought employment with tycho brahe who had some of the most precise astronomical data available using brahes precise observations of the planet mars kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary motion in 1609, johannes kepler published his three laws of planetary motion explaining how the planets orbit the sun in keplers final planetary model he described planetary orbits as following elliptical paths with the sun at a focal point of the ellipse kepler discovered that the square of the orbital period of each planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit or equivalently that the ratio of these two values is constant for all planets in the solar systemnote 4  on 25 august 1609, galileo galilei demonstrated his first telescope to a group of venetian merchants and in early january 1610, galileo observed four dim objects near jupiter which he mistook for stars however after a few days of observation galileo realized that these were in fact orbiting jupiter these four objects named the galilean moons in honor of their discoverer were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the earth or sun galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months and by the middle of 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods  galilean free falledit  galileo galilei  distance traveled by a freely falling ball is proportional to the square of the elapsed time  sometime prior to 1638, galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall attempting to characterize these motions galileo was not the first to investigate earths gravitational field nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics however galileos reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists it is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept or if they were real experiments performed by Galileo,10 but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling a biography by galileos pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls of the same material but different masses from the leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their massnote 5 in support of this conclusion galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument he asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body the only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate.11  a later experiment was described in galileos two new sciences published in 1638. one of galileos fictional characters salviati describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp the wooden ramp was cubits long half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick with a straight smooth polished groove the groove was lined with also smooth and polished as possible and into this groove was placed hard smooth and very round bronze ball the ramp was inclined at various angles to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured the ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured the time was measured using a water clock described as follows  large vessel of water placed in an elevated position to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length the water thus collected was weighed after each descent on a very accurate balance the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many many times there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.12  galileo found that for an object in free fall the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time  galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the earths gravitational field have a constant acceleration and galileos contemporary johannes kepler had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the suns gravitational mass however galileos free fall motions and keplers planetary motions remained distinct during galileos lifetime  newtonian massedit  isaac newton 1689  earths moon  mass of earth  semi-major axis  sidereal orbital period  0.002 569 au  0.074 802 sidereal year  earths gravity  earths radius  9.806 65ms2  6 375km  robert hooke had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674, stating that all celestial bodies have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity he further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center.13 in correspondence with isaac newton from 1679 and 1680, hooke conjectured that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies.14 hooke urged newton who was a pioneer in the development of calculus to work through the mathematical details of keplerian orbits to determine if hookes hypothesis was correct newtons own investigations verified that hooke was correct but due to personal differences between the two men newton chose not to reveal this to hooke isaac newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684, at which time he told a friend edmond halley that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits but had misplaced the solution in his office.15 after being encouraged by halley newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings in november 1684, isaac newton sent a document to edmund halley now lost but presumed to have been titled de motu corporum in gyrum for the motion of bodies in an orbit.16 halley presented newtons findings to the royal society of london with a promise that a fuller presentation would follow newton later recorded his ideas in a three book set entitled philosophi naturalis principia mathematica principles of natural philosophy the first was received by the royal society on 28 april 16856 the second on 2 march 16867 and the third on 6 april 16867. the royal society published newtons entire collection at their own expense in may 16867.1731  isaac newton had bridged the gap between keplers gravitational mass and galileos gravitational acceleration resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these  where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist is the gravitational mass gravitational parameter of the body causing gravitational fields and r is the radial coordinate distance between the centers of the two bodies  by finding the exact relationship between a bodys gravitational mass and its gravitational field newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass the mass of the earth can be determined using keplers method the orbit of earths moon or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the earths surface and multiplying that by the square of the earths radius the mass of the earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the sun to date no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.18  newtons cannonballedit  a cannon on top of a very high mountain shoots a cannonball horizontally if the speed is low the cannonball quickly falls back to earth at intermediate speeds it will revolve around earth along an elliptical orbit at a sufficiently high speed it will leave the earth altogether  main article newtons cannonball  newtons cannonball was a thought experiment used to bridge the gap between galileos gravitational acceleration and keplers elliptical orbits it appeared in newtons 1728 book a treatise of the system of the world according to galileos concept of gravitation a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the earth however newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally sideways or perpendicular to earths gravity it follows a curved path a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path which by the projection alone it should have pursued and made to describe a curve line in the air and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected the farther it goes before it falls to the Earth.17513 newton further reasons that if an object were in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain with sufficient velocity would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the earth and return to the mountain from which it was projectedcitation needed  universal gravitational massedit  an apple experiences gravitational fields directed towards every part of the earth however the sum total of these many fields produces a single gravitational field directed towards the earths center  in contrast to earlier theories celestial spheres which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material newtons theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal gravitational mass every object has gravitational mass and therefore every object generates a gravitational field newton further assumed that the strength of each objects gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object if a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the earth or sun newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body,17397 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the bodys center.17221note 6  for example according to newtons theory of universal gravitation each carob seed produces a gravitational field therefore if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere hence it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the earth or sun in fact by unit conversion it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass  vertical section drawing of cavendishs torsion balance instrument including the building in which it was housed the large balls were hung from a frame so they could be rotated into position next to the small balls by a pulley from outside figure 1 of cavendishs paper  measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle but extremely difficult in practice according to newtons theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere however from a practical standpoint the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure newtons books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s, but the first successful measurement of the earths mass in terms of traditional mass units the cavendish experiment did not occur until 1797, over a hundred years later cavendish found that the earths density was 5.448 0.033 times that of water as of 2009, the earths mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figuresclarification needed  given two objects a and b of masses ma and mb separated by a displacement rab newtons law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other of magnitude   where g is the universal gravitational constant the above statement may be reformulated in the following way if g is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass m is   this is the basis by which masses are determined by weighing in simple spring scales for example the force f is proportional to the displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan as per hookes law and the scales are calibrated to take g into account allowing the mass m to be read off assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance a balance measures relative weight giving the relative gravitation mass of each object  inertial massedit  massmeter a device for measuring the inertial mass of an astronaut in weightlessness the mass is calculated via the oscillation period for a spring with the astronaut attached state museum of the history of cosmonautics  inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration this definition has been championed by ernst Mach1920 and has since been developed into the notion of operationalism by percy w Bridgman.2122 the simple classical mechanics definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of special relativity but the essential meaning is the same  in classical mechanics according to newtons second law we say that a body has a mass m if at any instant of time it obeys the equation of motion  where f is the resultant force acting on the body and a is the acceleration of the bodys centre of massnote 7 for the moment we will put aside the question of what acting on the body actually means  this equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body consider two objects with different masses if we apply an identical force to each the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration we might say that the larger mass exerts a greater to changing its state of motion in response to the force  however this notion of applying forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is we can sidestep this difficulty with the help of newtons third law which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object it will experience an equal and opposite force to be precise suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses m1 and m2. we isolate the two objects from all other physical influences so that the only forces present are the force exerted on m1 by m2, which we denote F12, and the force exerted on m2 by m1, which we denote F21. newtons second law states that  where a1 and a2 are the accelerations of m1 and m2, respectively suppose that these accelerations are non-zero so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero this occurs for example if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another newtons third law then states that  and thus  if is non-zero the fraction is well-defined which allows us to measure the inertial mass of m1. in this case m2 is our object and we can define its mass m as 1kilogram. then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations  additionally mass relates a bodys momentum p to its linear velocity v   and the bodys kinetic energy k to its velocity   the primary difficulty with machs definition of mass is that it fails to take into account the potential energy binding energy needed to bring two masses sufficiently close to one another to perform the measurement of mass.20 this is most vividly demonstrated by comparing the mass of the proton in the nucleus of deuterium to the mass of the proton in free space is greater by about 0.239 this is due to the binding energy of deuterium thus for example if the reference weight m2 is taken to be the mass of the neutron in free space and the relative accelerations for the proton and neutron in deuterium are computed then the above formula over-estimates the mass m1 0.239 for the proton in deuterium at best machs formula can only be used to obtain ratios of masses that is as m1 an additional difficulty was pointed out by henri poincar which is that the measurement of instantaneous acceleration is impossible unlike the measurement of time or distance there is no way to measure acceleration with a single measurement one must make multiple measurements position time etc and perform a computation to obtain the acceleration poincar termed this to be an flaw in the mach definition of mass.23  atomic massedit  main article atomic mass unit  typically the mass of objects is measured in relation to that of the kilogram which is defined as the mass of the international prototype kilogram a platinum alloy cylinder stored in an environmentally-monitored safe secured in a vault at the international bureau of weights and measures in france however the ipk is not convenient for measuring the masses of atoms and particles of similar scale as it contains trillions of trillions of atoms and has most certainly lost or gained a little mass over time despite the best efforts to prevent this it is much easier to precisely compare an atoms mass to that of another atom thus scientists developed the atomic mass unit dalton by definition 1u is exactly one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and by extension a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12u. this definition however might be changed by the proposed redefinition of si base units which will leave the dalton very close to one but no longer exactly equal to it.2425  mass in relativityedit  special relativityedit  main article mass in special relativity  in special relativity there are two kinds of mass rest mass massnote 8 and relativistic mass increases with velocity rest mass is the newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object relativistic mass is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by c2. the two are related by the following equation  where is the lorentz factor  the invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames while the relativistic mass depends on the observers frame of reference in order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers it is convenient to use rest mass the rest mass of a body is also related to its energy e and the magnitude of its momentum p by the relativistic energy-momentum equation  so long as the system is closed with respect to mass and energy both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference the conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others matter particles as atoms may be converted to non-matter particles as photons of light but this does not affect the total amount of mass or energy although things like heat may not be matter all types of energy still continue to exhibit massnote 926 thus mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity rather both are names for the same thing and neither mass nor energy appear without the other  both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship e mc2, yielding rest energy and energy system energy respectively  the mass and energy concepts are related to their counterparts but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum because the relativistic mass is proportional to the energy it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists.27 there is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful pedagogically.282930  in bound systems the binding energy must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound the mass of the system changes in this process merely because the system was not closed during the binding process so the energy escaped for example the binding energy of atomic nuclei is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed leaving nuclides which have less mass than the free particles of which they are composed  massenergy equivalence also holds in macroscopic systems.31 for example if one takes exactly one kilogram of ice and applies heat the mass of the resulting melt-water will be more than a kilogram it will include the mass from the thermal energy heat used to melt the ice this follows from the conservation of energy.32 this number is small but not negligible about 3.7 nanograms it is given by the latent heat of melting ice kjkg divided by the speed of light squared 91016 m2s2.  general relativityedit  main article mass in general relativity  in general relativity the equivalence principle is any of several related concepts dealing with the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass at the core of this assertion is albert einsteins idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body as the earth is the same as the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial accelerated frame of reference  however it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general definition for the concept of invariant mass in general relativity at the core of the problem is the non-linearity of the einstein field equations making it impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the stressenergy tensor in a way that is invariant for all observers for a given observer this can be achieved by the stressenergymomentum pseudotensor.33  mass in quantum physicsedit  in classical mechanics the inert mass of a particle appears in the eulerlagrange equation as a parameter m   after quantization replacing the position vector x with a wave function the parameter m appears in the kinetic energy operator   in the ostensibly covariant invariant dirac equation and in natural units this becomes  where the parameter m is now simply a constant associated with the quantum described by the wave function  in the standard model of particle physics as developed in the 1960s, this term arises from the coupling of the field to an additional field the higgs field in the case of fermions the higgs mechanism results in the replacement of the term m in the lagrangian with this shifts the explanandum of the value for the mass of each elementary particle to the value of the unknown couplings g  tachyonic particles and imaginary massedit  main articles tachyonic field and tachyon mass  a tachyonic field or simply tachyon is a quantum field with an imaginary mass.34 although tachyons that move faster than light are a purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist,3435 fields with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics36363738 and are discussed in popular books on physics.3439 under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals is no violation of causality.40 while the field may have imaginary mass any physical particles do not the mass shows that the system becomes unstable and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of phase transition called tachyon condensation related to second order phase transitions that results in symmetry breaking in current models of particle physics  the term was coined by gerald feinberg in a 1967 paper,41 but it was soon realized that feinbergs model in fact did not allow for superluminal speeds.40 instead the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons this process is known as tachyon condensation well known examples include the condensation of the higgs boson in particle physics and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics  although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass the mass is not quantized rather the scalar field is even for tachyonic quantum fields the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute anticommute thus preserving causality therefore information still does not propagate faster than light,41 and solutions grow exponentially but not superluminally is no violation of causality tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared.42  this is a special case of the general rule where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a complex mass with the real part being their mass in the usual sense and the imaginary part being the decay rate in natural units.42 however in quantum field theory a particle state is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time ie an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian an unstable particle is a state which is only approximately constant over time if it exists long enough to be measured it can be formally described as having a complex mass with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part if both parts are of the same magnitude this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather than a particle as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process in the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it  in a lorentz invariant theory the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles called in discussions of tachyons must also apply to tachyons in particular the energymomentum relation  p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass should still apply along with the formula for the total energy of a particle  this equation shows that the total energy of a particle or tachyon contains a contribution from its rest mass massenergy and a contribution from its motion the kinetic energy when v is larger than c the denominator in the equation for the energy is as the value under the radical is negative because the total energy must be real the numerator must also be imaginary ie the rest mass m must be imaginary as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number  exotic matter and negative massedit  main article negative mass  the negative mass exists in the model to describe dark energy energy and radiation in negative-index metamaterial in a unified way.43 in this way the negative mass is associated with negative momentum negative pressure negative kinetic energy and ftl  see alsoedit  mass versus weight  effective mass system  effective mass physics  extension  international system of quantities  proposed redefinition of si base units  notesedit  when a distinction is necessary m is used to denote the active gravitational mass and m the passive gravitational mass  since the avogadro constant na is defined as the number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12, it follows that 1u is exactly 1103NAkg.  the distinction between and gravitational mass does not exist in the newtonian view of gravity as found in classical mechanics and can safely be ignored for many purposes in most practical applications newtonian gravity is assumed because it is usually sufficiently accurate and is simpler than general relativity for example nasa uses primarily newtonian gravity to design space missions although are routinely enhanced by accounting for tiny relativistic effects.www2.jpl.nasa.govbasicsbsf3-2.php the distinction between and is very abstract and applies to post-graduate level applications of general relativity to certain problems in cosmology and is otherwise not used there is nevertheless an important conceptual distinction in newtonian physics between mass and mass although these quantities are identical the conceptual distinction between these two fundamental definitions of mass is maintained for teaching purposes because they involve two distinct methods of measurement it was long considered anomalous that the two distinct measurements of mass and gravitational gave an identical result the property observed by galileo that objects of different mass fall with the same rate of acceleration air resistance shows that inertial and gravitational mass are the same  this constant ratio was later shown to be a direct measure of the suns active gravitational mass it has units of distance cubed per time squared and is known as the standard gravitational parameter  at the time when viviani asserts that the experiment took place galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall he had however formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed see drake s galileo at work university of chicago press pp.1920. ISBN0-226-16226-5.  these two properties are very useful as they allow spherical collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual objects  in its original form newtons second law is valid only for bodies of constant mass  it is possible to make a slight distinction between mass and mass for a system of two or more particles none of the particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer to avoid this confusion some sources will use mass only for individual particles and mass for systems  for example a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box sitting on a scale would in theory show no change in mass when detonated the inside of the box would become much hotter in such a system the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to escape from the box as light or heat however in that case the removed energy would take its associated mass with it letting heat or radiation out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass thus mass like energy cannot be destroyed but only moved from one place to another  referencesedit  httpdictionaryreferencecombrowsemass  quantum theory separates gravitational and inertial mass mit technology review 14 jun 2010. retrieved 3 dec 2013.  von klitzing klaus 2017. in 2019 nature physics springer nature 13 198.
