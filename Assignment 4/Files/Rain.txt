atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the earth it provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation  rain falling on a field in southern estonia  the major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts if enough moisture and upward motion is present precipitation falls from convective clouds with strong upward vertical motion such as cumulonimbus clouds which can organize into narrow rainbands in mountainous areas heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains on the leeward side of mountains desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass the movement of the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone brings rainy seasons to savannah climes  the urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall both in amounts and intensity downwind of cities global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally including wetter conditions across eastern north america and drier conditions in the tropicscitation needed antarctica is the driest continent the globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715mm but over the whole earth it is much higher at 990mm climate classification systems such as the kppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing

air contains water vapor and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air known as the mixing ratio is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air the amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature.4 how much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated humidity and forms into a cloud group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the earths surface5 depends on its temperature warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated therefore one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it the dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.6  there are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands.7 the air can rise due to convection large-scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain lift conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,8 usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation either by the air or by the surface underneath.9 evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature or until it reaches saturation.10  the main ways water vapor is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion,11 precipitation or virga falling from above,12 daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land,13 transpiration from plants,14 cool or dry air moving over warmer water,15 and lifting air over mountains.16 water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds elevated portions of weather fronts are three-dimensional in nature17 force broad areas of upward motion within the earths atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus.18 stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.19  coalescence and fragmentation  the shape of rain drops depending upon their size  coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets  black rain clouds  as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing and is also known as the warm rain process.20 in clouds below freezing when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall this generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets this process is temperature dependent as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing in addition because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.21  raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 9mm to 0.3543in mean diameter above which they tend to break up smaller drops are called cloud droplets and their shape is spherical as a raindrop increases in size its shape becomes more oblate with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom like hamburger buns very large ones are shaped like parachutes.2223 contrary to popular belief their shape does not resemble a teardrop.24 the biggest raindrops on earth were recorded over brazil and the marshall islands in 2004 some of them were as large as 10mm the large size is explained by condensation on large smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.25  rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops.26  a raindrop on a leaf  intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related ie high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.2728  droplet size distribution  the final droplet size distribution is an exponential distribution the number of droplets with diameter between and per unit volume of space is this is commonly referred to as the marshallpalmer law after the researchers who first characterized it.2329 the parameters are somewhat temperature-dependent,30 and the slope also scales with the rate of rainfall in centimeters and r in millimetres per hour.23  deviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions the distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall while instantaneous size spectra often deviate and have been modeled as gamma distributions.31 the distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation.23  raindrop impacts  raindrops impact at their terminal velocity which is greater for larger drops due to their larger mass to drag ratio at sea level and without wind 0.5mm drizzle impacts at 2ms or 7.2kmh while large 5mm drops impact at around 9ms or 32kmh  rain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized.33 the air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain the density of the air 2.7 billion years ago.34  the sound of raindrops hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater.3536  the metar code for rain is ra while the coding for rain showers is SHRA.37  virga  main article virga  in certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching the ground this is termed virga and is more often seen in hot and dry climates  causes  frontal activity  main article weather fronts  stratiform broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity and dynamic precipitation precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems the order of cms such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones.38 a wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front with thunderstorms possible but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.39 what separates rainfall from other precipitation types such as ice pellets and snow is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground if there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing freezing rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments will result.40 hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds 3,400m above ground level.41  convection  convective precipitation  orographic precipitation  convective rain or showery precipitation occurs from convective clouds cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective however it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.3842 graupel and hail indicate convection.43 in mid-latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts squall lines and warm fronts.44  orographic effects  main articles orographic lift precipitation types and united states rainfall climatology  orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation in mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds example the trade winds a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving drier air katabatic wind on the descending and generally warming leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.16  in hawaii mount waialeale on the island of kauai is notable for its extreme rainfall as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on earth with 12,000mm systems known as kona storms affect the state with heavy rains between october and April.46 local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography divisible into windward and leeward regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall leeward sides are drier and sunnier with less rain and less cloud cover.47  in south america the andes mountain range blocks pacific moisture that arrives in that continent resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.48 the sierra nevada range creates the same effect in north america forming the great basin and mojave Deserts.4950  within the tropics  rainfall distribution by month in cairns showing the extent of the wet season at that location  see also monsoon and tropical cyclone  main article wet season  the wet or rainy season is the time of year covering one or more months when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls.51 the term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.52 areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.53 savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.54 some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season.27 when the wet season occurs during the warm season or summer rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours the wet season is a time when air quality improves,55 freshwater quality improves,5657 and vegetation grows significantly  tropical cyclones a source of very heavy rainfall consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction hemisphere or counter clockwise hemisphere.58 although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.59 areas in their path can receive a years worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.60  human influence  image of atlanta georgia showing temperature distribution with blue showing cool temperatures red warm and hot areas appearing white  mean surface temperature anomalies during the period 1999 to 2008 with respect to the average temperatures from 1940 to 1980  see also global warming and urban heat island  the fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms cloud condensation nuclei leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain as commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week the likelihood of rain increases it peaks by saturday after five days of weekday pollution has been built up in heavily populated areas that are near the coast such as the united states eastern seaboard the effect can be dramatic there is a 22 higher chance of rain on saturdays than on Mondays.61 the urban heat island effect warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 c to 10.1 f above surrounding suburbs and rural areas this extra heat leads to greater upward motion which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48 and 116. partly as a result of this warming monthly rainfall is about 28 greater between 32 to 64km to 40mi downwind of cities compared with upwind.62 some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51.63  increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation precipitation generally increased over land north of 30N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century although trends have varied widely by region and over time eastern portions of north and south america northern europe and northern and central asia have become wetter the sahel the mediterranean southern africa and parts of southern asia have become drier there has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughtsespecially in the tropics and subtropics changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters more precipitation along with increased salinity in lower latitudes less precipitation andor more evaporation over the contiguous united states total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the east north central climate region percent per century and the south hawaii was the only region to show a decrease  analysis of 65 years of united states of america rainfall records show the lower 48 states have an increase in heavy downpours since 1950. the largest increases are in the northeast and midwest which in the past decade have seen 31 and 16 percent more heavy downpours compared to the 1950s. rhode island is the state with the largest increase 104. mcallen texas is the city with the largest increase 700. heavy downpour in the analysis are the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1 percent of all rain and snow days during the years 1950-20146566  the most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding which include techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and suppress hail.67  characteristics  patterns  band of thunderstorms seen on a weather radar display  main article rainband  rainbands are cloud and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated rainbands can be stratiform or convective,68 and are generated by differences in temperature when noted on weather radar imagery this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure.69 rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion,70 and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.71  rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes.72 rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the fronts orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet.73 bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries if enough moisture is present if sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front they can mask the location of the cold front itself.74  once a cyclone occludes a trough of warm air aloft or for short will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast and ultimately northwestern periphery known as the warm conveyor belt forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front the trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature it can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection.75 banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain.76 behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the great lakes downwind of islands bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges offshore california this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.77  rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that together with the eyewall and the eye constitute a hurricane or tropical storm the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclones intensity.78  acidity  sources of acid rain  see also acid rain  the phrase acid rain was first used by scottish chemist robert augus smith in 1852.79 the ph of rain varies especially due to its origin on americas east coast rain that is derived from the atlantic ocean typically has a ph of 5.0-5.6 rain that comes across the continental from the west has a ph of 3.8-4.8 and local thunderstorms can have a ph as low as 2.0.80 rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids sulfuric acid and nitric acid sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes and wetlands reducing bacteria and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels and mining where H2S is present nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning soil bacteria and natural fires while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants in the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium likely as ammonia from livestock production which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.81  kppen climate classification  updated kppen-geiger climate map82  af  am  aw  bwh  bwk  bsh  bsk  csa  csb  cwa  cwb  cfa  cfb  cfc  dsa  dsb  dsc  dsd  dwa  dwb  dwc  dwd  dfa

classification has five primary types labeled a through e specifically the primary types are a tropical b dry c mild mid-latitude d cold mid-latitude and e polar the five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest monsoon tropical savanna humid subtropical humid continental oceanic climate mediterranean climate steppe subarctic climate tundra polar ice cap and desert  rain forests are characterized by high rainfall with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000mm and 79in.83 a tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes with rainfall between 750 and 1,270mm and 50in a year they are widespread on africa and are also found in india the northern parts of south america malaysia and Australia.84 the humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones.85 humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents roughly between latitudes 20 and 40 degrees away from the equator.86  an oceanic maritime climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the worlds continents bordering cool oceans as well as southeastern australia and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.87 the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin parts of western north america parts of western and south australia in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters.88 a steppe is a dry grassland.89 subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.90  measurement  gauges  standard rain gauge  see also rain gauge disdrometer and snow gauge  rain is measured in units of length per unit time typically in millimeters per hour,91 or in countries where imperial units are more common inches per hour.92 the or more accurately being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time typically an hour.93 one millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.94  the standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge which can be found in 100-mm plastic and 200-mm metal varieties.95 the inner cylinder is filled by 25mm of rain with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25mm resolution while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25mm markings after the inner cylinder is filled the amount inside it is discarded then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty.96 other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge cheapest rain gauge and most fragile the tipping bucket rain gauge and the weighing rain gauge.97 for those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with any of the above rain gauges can be made at home with enough know-how.98  when a precipitation measurement is made various networks exist across the united states and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the internet such as cocorahs or GLOBE.99100 if a network is not available in the area where one lives the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement.101  remote sensing  see also weather radar  twenty-four-hour rainfall accumulation on the val dirne radar in eastern canada zones without data in the east and southwest are caused by beam blocking from mountains environment canada  one of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for hydrological purposes.102 for instance river flood control sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration to produce radar accumulations rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points a radar equation is then used which is   where z represents the radar reflectivity r represents the rainfall rate and a and b are constants.103 satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive microwave instruments aboard polar orbiting as well as geostationary weather satellites to indirectly measure rainfall rates.104 if one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time  play media  1988 rain in the us the heaviest rain is seen in reds and yellows

heavy rain when the precipitation rate is 7.6mm per hour,105 or between 10mm and 50mm per hour106  violent rain when the precipitation rate is 50mm per hour106  euphemisms for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer trash-mover and toad-strangler.107 the intensity can also be expressed by rainfall erosivity R-factor108  return period  see also 100-year flood  the likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration is called the return period or frequency.109 the intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration from charts based on historic data for the location.110 the term 1 in 10year storm describes a rainfall event which is unusual and has a 50 chance of occurring in any 10-year period the term 1 in 100year storm describes a rainfall event which is rare and which will occur with a 50 probability in any 100-year period as with all probability events it is possible though improbable to have multiple in 100Year storms in a single year.111  forecasting  main article quantitative precipitation forecast  example of a five-day rainfall forecast from the hydrometeorological prediction center  the quantitative precipitation forecast qpf is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.112 a qpf will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a qpf valid period precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800GMT. terrain is considered in qpfs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail.113 starting in the mid to late 1990s, qpfs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the united States.114 forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere which decreases with height.115 qpf can be generated on a quantitative forecasting amounts or a qualitative forecasting the probability of a specific amount basis.116 radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image the forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements weather radar estimates or a combination of both various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.117  impact  effect on agriculture  rainfall estimates for southern japan and the surrounding region from july 2027, 2009.  precipitation especially rain has a dramatic effect on agriculture all plants need at least some water to survive therefore rain the most effective means of watering is important to agriculture while a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants too much or too little rainfall can be harmful even devastating to crops drought can kill crops and increase erosion,118 while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth.119 plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive for example certain cacti require small amounts of water,120 while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive  in areas with wet and dry seasons soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.27 animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature.121 developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest which occurs late in the wet season.122 rain may be harvested through the use of rainwater tanks treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation.123 excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.124  in culture  see also list of rain deities  cultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world in temperate climates people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy with its impact greater on men than women.125 rain can also bring joy as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it in dry places such as India,126 or during periods of drought,127 rain lifts peoples moods in botswana the setswana word for rain pula is used as the name of the national currency in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country since it has a desert climate.128 several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers.129 many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive the source of this scent is petrichor an oil produced by plants then absorbed by rocks and soil and later released into the air during rainfall.130  global climatology  see also earth rainfall climatology  approximately 505,000km3 of water falls as precipitation each year across the globe with 398,000km3 of it over the oceans.131 given the earths surface area that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990mm deserts are defined as areas with an average annual precipitation of less than 250mm per year,132133 or as areas where more water is lost by evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation.134  deserts  main article desert  largest deserts  the northern half of africa is occupied by the

are often known as polar deserts a common biome in this area is the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter ice caps see no rain at all making antarctica the worlds driest continent  rainforests  see also rainforest  rainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall both tropical and temperate rainforests exist tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude but they are often found in other areas  around 40-75 of all biotic life is found in rainforests rainforests are also responsible for 28 of the worlds oxygen turnover  monsoons  see also monsoon and monsoon trough  the equatorial region near the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough is the wettest portion of the worlds continents annually the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by august then moves back southward into the southern hemisphere by february and March.137 within asia rainfall is favored across its southern portion from india east and northeast across the philippines and southern china into japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the indian ocean into the region.138 the monsoon trough can reach as far north as the 40th parallel in east asia during august before moving southward thereafter its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure thermal low over the warmest part of Asia.139140 similar but weaker monsoon circulations are present over north america and Australia.141142 during the summer the southwest monsoon combined with gulf of california and gulf of mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the atlantic ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening thunderstorms to the southern tier of the united states as well as the great Plains.143 the eastern half of the contiguous united states east of the 98th meridian the mountains of the pacific northwest and the sierra nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation with average rainfall exceeding 760mm per

altering rainfall patterns across the western united States,149 Midwest,150151 the Southeast,152 and throughout the tropics there is also evidence that global warming is leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of north america while droughts are becoming more frequent in the tropics and subtropics  wettest known locations  cherrapunji situated on the southern slopes of the eastern himalaya in shillong india is the confirmed wettest place on earth with an average annual rainfall of 11,430mm the highest recorded rainfall in a single year was 22,987mm in 1861. the 38-year average at nearby mawsynram meghalaya india is 11,873mm the wettest spot in australia is mount bellenden ker in the north-east of the country which records an average of 8,000mm per year with over 12,200mm of rain recorded during 2000.154 mount waialeale on the island of kauai in the hawaiian islands averages more than 12,000mm of rain per year over the last 32 years with a record 17,340mm in 1982.citation needed its summit is considered one of the rainiest spots on earth it has been promoted in tourist literature for many years as the wettest spot in the world.156not in citation given llor a town situated in choc colombia is probably the place with the largest rainfall in the world averaging 13,300mm per year.155 the department of choc is extraordinarily humid tutunenda a small town situated in the same department is one of the wettest estimated places on earth averaging 11,394mm per year in 1974 the town received 26,303mm 3.6in,citation needed the largest annual rainfall measured in colombia unlike cherrapunji which receives most of its rainfall between april and september tutunenda receives rain almost uniformly distributed throughout the year.157 quibd the capital of choc receives the most rain in the world among cities with over 100,000 inhabitants 9,000mm per year.155 storms in choc can drop 500mm of rainfall in a day this amount is more than what falls in
