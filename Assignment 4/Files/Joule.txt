to work done on an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre newton metre or nm it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second it is named after the english physicist james prescott joule  in terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si units  where kg is the kilogram m is the metre s is the second n is the newton pa is the pascal w is the watt c is the coulomb and v is the volt  one joule can also be defined as  the work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt or one this relationship can be used to define the volt  the work required to produce one watt of power for one second or one kilowatt-hour 3.6 megajoules this relationship can be used to define the watt  contents  1 usage  2 confusion with newton metre  3 practical examples  4

conversions  6 see also  7 notes and references  usageedit  this si unit is named after james prescott joule as with every international system of units unit named for a person the first letter of its symbol is upper case however when an si unit is spelled out in english it should always begin with a lower case letter in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case note that celsius conforms to this rule because the is lowercasebased on the international system of units section 5.2.  confusion with newton metreedit  main article newton metre  in mechanics the concept of force some direction has a close analog in the concept of torque some angle  linear  angular  force  torque  mass  moment of inertia  distance  angle  a result of this similarity is that the si unit for torque is the newton metre which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule but they are not interchangeable the cgpm has given the unit of energy the name joule but has not given the unit of torque any special name hence it is simply the newton metre a compound name derived from its constituent parts.5 the use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.5  the distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement by contrast torque is a vector the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector torque and energy are related to one another by the equation  where e is energy is vector magnitude of torque and is the angle swept radians since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions  practical examplesedit  one joule in everyday life represents approximately  the energy required to lift a medium-size tomato 1m vertically from the surface of the Earth.6  the energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground  the energy required to accelerate a 1kg mass at 1 ms2 through a distance of 1m.  the heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 0.24C.7

or kilogram metre squared per second squared this however is an algebraic freedom to be governed by common sense physical considerations in a given situation some forms may be more helpful than others in practice with certain quantities preference is given to the use of certain special unit names or combinations of unit names to facilitate the distinction between different quantities having the
