teams successful pleas to judge h lee sarokin of the united states district court for the district of new jersey  in 1966, rubin hurricane carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer expected by many fans to become the worlds greatest boxing champion when three victims specifically the clubs bartender and a male and a female customer were shot to death in a bar in paterson new jersey carter and his friend john artis driving home from another club in paterson were stopped and interrogated by the police  although the police asserted that carter and artis were innocent and thus never suspects a

beacon pictures and went on to write the first scripts while establishing a financing partnership with irving Azoff.4 at first jewison felt the story was so extensive that it would fit better as a television miniseries.3 once denzel washington signed to play the title character he went through long boxing training and worked closely with rubin carter washington said went through pots and pots of coffee and packs of cigarettes id drink a little coffee its interesting and challenging when the person is there alive and in the room.5 filming began in november 1998, with locations in both new jersey east jersey state prison in trenton and the cities of avenel and paterson and Toronto.6  soundtrackedit  the hurricane soundtrack  soundtrack album by various artists  released  january 11,

the berlin international film festival on february 17, 2000.  two weeks prior to its opening in north america a premiere for the hurricane was held at the mann village theater in los angeles many of the depicted people were in attendance when asked about being portrayed by denzel washington rubin carter replied that i didnt know i was that good-looking the film was praised by lesra martin who described it as stupendous depiction of accurate events and john artis carters friend who was convicted with him said he was in awe to see what unfolded and not have to feel the pressure i felt at the time an objection was held by h lee sarokin the federal judge who freed carter saying that unlike his portrayal by rod steiger im a lower-key guy.8  box officeedit  the film opened in north american limited release on december 29, 1999. the first weeks gross was screens and the total receipts for the run were in its widest release the film was featured in 2,148 theaters it closed the week of april 14, 2000. the motion picture was in circulation sixteen weeks.9  critical responseedit  reviews were positive with much praise to denzel washingtons performance the film has an 83 approval rating at rotten tomatoes based on 113 reviews the consensus reads in large part to one of denzel washingtons most powerful on-screen performances the hurricane is a moving inspirational sports drama even if it takes few risks in telling its story.10 roger ebert film critic for the chicago sun times liked the film and the acting and wrote is one of denzel washingtons great performances on a par with his work in malcolm xwashington as hurricane carter is spare focused filled with anger and pride this is strong stuff and i was amazed after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts until at the end i was blinking at tears what affects me emotionally at the movies is never sadness but goodness.11  regarding the aspects of the film ebert discussed why that is often the case in films people have told me dubiously that they heard the movie was well of course it was those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother most biopics like most grandmothers see the good in a man and demonize his enemies they pass silently over his imprudent romances in dramatizing his victories they simplify them and they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters if they didnt we wouldnt pay to see them he added hurricane is not a documentary but a parable in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word.11  film critic stephen holden writing for the new york times had mixed views of the film but did like the acting he wrote telling the story of mr carters protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice the hurricane rides to glory on an astonishing performance by denzel washingtonthat is to say mr washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark if his hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his characters forcefully articulate surface.12  holden was forthright about the veracity of the film writing film is so eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for dramatic effect among its most egregious distortions is its depiction of mr carters 1964 middleweight title match with joey giardello the movie has fine naturalistic boxing sequences inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by carter solely because of the judges racism the taking of such license of course adds an extra jolt of drama but when these and other distortions and exaggerations are added up its worth wondering if that self-congratulatory glow the movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what cost.12  jewison considers the hurricane his best work.13

life and the case itself as documented in both his criminal and military records and police reports and court documentation such critics include herald-news reporter cal Deal16 larry Elder17 thomas clough barbara burns the daughter of victim hazel tanis george kimball of the irish Times18 milan simonich of the pittsburgh post-gazette lona Manning19 the new york times reporter robert Lipsyte20 paul mulshine of the star-ledger and jack newfield of the new york post who stated knew rubin carter attended his fights covered his retrial and i didnt see much reality on the screencitation needed the new yorker film critic david denby called it evasive and factually very thin a liberal fairytale.21  lawsuitedit  former middleweight world champion joey giardello sued the films producers for libel over the depiction of his fight with carter as a fix is a joke told the new york daily news he never hit me that much in 15 rounds virtually every boxing expert then and now will tell you i won the fight referee robert polis who scored the fight 7266 in giardellos favor stated portrayed joey giardello as an incompetent fighter i thought it was ludicrous.22 even carter himself agreed that giardello was the rightful victor.23  eventually the case was settled out of court with the producers paying the retired champion damages and with jewison agreeing to make a statement on the dvd version that no doubt was a great fighter.24  see alsoedit  denzel washington filmography  referencesedit  a b hurricane box office mojo retrieved 2016-05-12.  a b deming mark hurricane answerscom
