do sul southern brazil  part of the south atlantic tropical cyclones  hurricane catarina pronunciationkatain was an extremely rare south atlantic tropical cyclone that hit southeastern brazil in late march 2004. the storm developed out of a stationary cold-core upper-level trough on March12. almost a week later on March19, a disturbance developed along the trough and traveled towards the east-southeast until March22 when a ridge stopped the forward motion of the disturbance the disturbance was in an unusually favorable environment with a little bit below-average wind shear and above-average sea surface temperatures the combination of the two led to a slow transition from an extratropical cyclone to a subtropical cyclone by March24. the storm continued to obtain tropical characteristics and became a tropical storm the next day while the winds steadily increased the storm attained wind speeds of 75mph to a low-end category 1 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scaleon March26. at this time it was unofficially named catarina and was also the first hurricane-intensity tropical cyclone ever recorded in the southern atlantic ocean unusually favorable conditions persisted and catarina continued to intensify and was estimated to have peaked with winds of 100mph on March28. the center of the storm made landfall later that day at the time between the cities of passo de torres and balnerio gaivota santa catarina catarina rapidly weakened upon landfall and dissipated the next day  since catarina was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in brazil since the beginning of reliable records and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it the damage was quite severe although the storm was an unprecedented event brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others agricultural products were severely damaged 85 of the banana crops and 40 of the rice crops were lost in the storm three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured damages from the storm amounted to million usd 2017USD.  contents  1 meteorological history  2 naming  3 rare

on March12, a cold-core stationary upper-level trough became established offshore of southern brazil a disturbance formed within the trough on the 19th, and moved east-southeastward until the 22nd, when a ridge to its southeast kept it stationary with exceptionally favorable upper level winds and slightly below average,2 if marginally warm water temperatures from 24 to 26C to 79F, it gradually developed resembling a subtropical storm by the 24th. located 630mi east-southeast of florianpolis it headed slowly westward and appeared to become a tropical storm on March25.3  a compact storm it continued westward while steadily intensifying the structure of the storm continued to improve and due to a definite eye feature showing on satellites the storm was determined to have become a hurricane-equivalent cyclone on March26.4 a brazilian newspaper had a headline catarina the state of santa catarina partly because of this headline the storm was unofficially named catarina it continued to encounter favorable conditions and reached a peak of 100mph estimated sustained winds on the 28th, which made the storm the equivalent of a Category2 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale gusts peaked at around 120mph the hurricane hit the southern coast of santa catarina and northeastern rio grande do sul with winds up to 195kmh overnight after making landfall catarina rapidly dissipated over land in the normal manner of a tropical cyclone.3  namingedit  hurricane catarina as seen from the international space station on march 26, 2004  further information tropical cyclone naming  brazilian meteorologists named the storm catarina for its proximity to eventual landfall near the state of santa catarina although government forecasters initially denied that the storm which clearly had an open eye and various other tropical morphologies was a hurricane at all more than a year after the storm made landfall brazilian meteorologists finally classified the storm as a tropical cyclone.5  north american forecasters however surprised as they were considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence since catarina had a clear eyewall structure bounded by deep convective dense central overcast well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure warm water temperatures of 79F little shear a warm core low overall tropical characteristics and occurred in march to september in the northern hemisphere the peak of hurricane season it was considered to be a hurricane by the national hurricane center in the united States.6  though it is most commonly known as catarina all names for this storm are in that no world meteorological organization-affiliated meteorological agency that monitors hurricanes named it cyclone names are predetermined by an international committee of the world meteorological Organization.7 it has also been unofficially called and the advisory names for it were from the united kingdoms met office and from the united states national hurricane center which keeps it well outside normal designation which start at 01L for named storms and use 90L to 99L for invests.3  rare formationedit  typically tropical cyclones do not form in the south atlantic ocean due to strong upper level shear cool water temperatures and the lack of a convergence zone of convection occasionally though as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable for catarina it was a combination of climatic and atmospheric anomalies water temperatures on catarinas path ranged from 24 to 25C, slightly less than the 26.5C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin.4  to this day catarina is the only hurricane strength tropical cyclone ever observed in the south atlantic ocean since 1970. other systems have been observed in this region however none have reached hurricane strength and no eyes were seen on satellite imagery or radar.9 while catarina formed in an unusual area its relation to global warming or any other type of global climatic change is still up for debate the brazilian society of meteorologypt attributed it to changes and atmospheric anomalies,5 while other researchers have indicated that it could be the result of the southern annular mode or other seasonal variations in weather within the southern hemisphere again linked to global changes in climate.10 however more research in the area is still needed to make a conclusion.10  impactedit  hurricane catarina at landfall  noaa satellite loop of hurricane catarina  like normal tropical cyclones catarina brought heavy flooding with it despite the uncertainty in the future of the storm brazilian officials took the appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the residents who lived along the coastline a successful evacuation was executed for numerous residents along the coast though some people decided to ride out the storm in their own homes.4 the storm damaged around 40,000 homes and destroyed 1,500 40 of the rice crop were also lost total damages were estimated at million usd 2017USD. it also killed at least three and injured at least 75. at least 2,000 people were left homeless following the storm.11  at passo de torres many shipyards were destroyed as they were not designed to withstand the pressure differentials caused by catarinas winds widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well.12 near the mampituba river a house was blown about 50meters upstream literally landing in another state it originally was built in the torres municipality of rio grande do sul yet it ended up in passo de torres within santa catarina in rural areas the corn banana and rice fields received the most damage although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses as they had harvested before catarina made landfall.12  overall almost 36,000residences were damaged as a result of catarinas onslaught of those 993 collapsed completely the commercial sector fared slightly better as only 2,274buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed finally 397public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed these account for 26 of the total buildings in the region and property damage of usd 2017USD. four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction brick residences typically lacked plaster beams or columns for example the areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families usually with annual family
