contributions from jazz musicians roy hargrove chris botti and viktor Krauss.4 a departure from the jazzy groove-based urban sound of bents previous work the album features an adult contemporary radio format style with sweeping strings layered vocals and nimble acoustic guitars.7 according to rashod d ollison of the washington post is lush in spots the overall sound more in the adult contemporary vein more christopher cross less r Kelly.7  receptionedit  allmusic writer stephen thomas erlewine gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and commented that quiet storm is well performed but dull yet the prince-styled numbers are engaging melodic and nimble strong showcases for benets mellow skills.1 mojo gave the album three out of five stars and called it very palatable collection of self-penned confessional songs.2 laura checkoway of vibe called it uneven mix of simplistic sentimentality stating and repentant at times hurricane is more likely to sing you to sleep than knock you off your feet.3 the washington post commented favorably on the albums themes of and redemption and stated spiritual tone often brings out the best in benets supple tenor on the end and other tracks.4
