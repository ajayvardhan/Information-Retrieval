images  hurricane matthew was the first Category5 atlantic hurricane since hurricane felix in 2007, caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in haiti and also spread widespread damage in the southeastern united states the deadliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane stan in 2005, matthew was the thirteenth named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it caused extensive damage to landmasses in the greater antilles and severe damage in several islands of the bahamas who were still recovering from hurricane joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier at one point the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of category 3 or higher intensity to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005, but matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the floridian coastline  originating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on September22, matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on September28. it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on September29, before undergoing explosive intensification ultimately reaching Category5 intensity on October1 at just 13.4N latitude the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004.1 matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles remaining a strong Category4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haitis tiburon peninsula early on October4, and then a second one in cuba later that day matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest making landfall in the northern bahamas the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8. matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras north carolina on October9.2  widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path however the most significant impacts were felt in haiti with US1.9billion in damage and 546deaths, making matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake the combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land around 80 of jrmie sustained significant damage four people were killed in cuba due to a bridge collapse and total losses in the country amounted to US2.58billion, most of which occurred in the guantnamo province passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane matthew spread damage across several islands grand bahama was hit directly where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding especially in the jacksonville metropolitan

matthew  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic being monitored by the national hurricane center for possible tropical cyclogenesis despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27, the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center however by 1200UTC on september 28, the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados hence becoming a tropical storm and was assigned the name matthew continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 1800UTC on September29. the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day and matthew began a period of explosive intensification during a 24-hour period beginning at 0000UTC on September30, the cyclones maximum winds more than doubled from 80mph to 165mph making matthew a category 5 hurricane,1 the first since hurricane felix in 20073 the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began due to upwelling of cooler waters matthew weakened to a Category4 hurricane later on October1, before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155mph late on october 2.1  slowly rounding the ridge matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from October15. intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais haiti around 1100 utc on october 4 with winds of 150mph and a pressure of 934 millibars making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964. continuing northward the hurricane struck mais in cuba early on October5 as a slightly weaker storm cubas and haitis mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas restrengthening occurred as matthews circulation became better organized with the storm becoming a Category4 hurricane again while passing freeport however matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a Category3 hurricane the strongest winds remaining just offshore matthew weakened to a Category2 hurricane late on October7 and then to a Category1 hurricane by 1200UTC on October8.1  the eye of hurricane matthew seen from the international space station on october 3.  around 1500UTC on October8, the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge near mcclellanville south carolina with winds of 85mph and a central pressure of 963mbar which made it the strongest to
