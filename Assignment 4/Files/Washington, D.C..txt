washington dc  various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks Maryland.5  in his federalist no 43, published january 23, 1788, james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.6 five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.7  article one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a exceeding tenmilessquare as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united States.8 however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790, madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each states remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united States.9a  foundation  map of the district of columbia in 1835, prior to the retrocession  on july 9, 1790, congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16. formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles on each side totaling 100 square miles  two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 1751,11 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 1749.12 during 179192, andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point.13 many of the stones are still standing.14  a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capitals construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time.1516 congress held its first session in washington on november 17, 1800.17  congress passed the organic act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west.18 after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in Congress.19  fords theatre in the 19th century site of the 1865 assassination of president lincoln  on august 2425, 1814, in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812. the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack.20 most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.21  retrocession and the civil war  see also district of columbia retrocession and washington dc in the american civil war  in the 1830s, the districts southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.22 the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandrias citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession.23  the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9, 1846, congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the districts current area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.22 confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself.24  the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the districts population including a large influx of freed slaves.25 president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation Proclamation.26 in 1868, congress granted the districts african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.25  growth and redevelopment  crowds surrounding the reflecting pool during the 1963 march on washington  by 1870, the districts population had grown 75 from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents.27 despite the citys growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal.28  congress passed the organic act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of Columbia.29 president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873. shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874, congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of Commissioners.30  the citys first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washingtons original boundaries washingtons urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades.31 georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895.32 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the beautiful movement in the early 1900s.33  increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in Washington.34 world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital35 by 1950, the districts population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.27  civil rights and home rule era  the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in Congress.36  after the assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr on april 4, 1968, riots broke out in the district primarily in the ustreet 14thStreet, 7thStreet, and hstreet corridors centers of black residential and commercial areas the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence many stores and other buildings were burned rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s.37  in 1973, congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the District.38 in 1975, walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the District.39  on september 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the pentagon in nearby arlington virginia united airlines flight 93, believed to be destined for washington dc crashed in pennsylvania when passengers tried to recover control of the plane from hijackers.4041  geography  main article geography of washington dc  calvert  charles  frederick  montgomery  princegeorges  alexandria  arlington  clarke  fairfax  fairfaxcounty

two major tributaries the anacostia river and rock Creek.44 tiber creek a natural watercourse that once passed through the national mall was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.45 the creek also formed a portion of the now-filled washington city canal which allowed passage through the city to the anacostia river from 1815 until the 1850s.46 the chesapeake and ohio canal starts in georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the little falls of the potomac river located at the northwest edge of washington at the atlantic seaboard fall line.47  the highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet above sea level at fort reno park in upper northwest Washington.48 the lowest point is sea level at the potomac River.49 the geographic center of washington is

snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.66 according to notes kept at the time the city received between 30 and 36 inches and 91cm from a snowstorm on january 1772.67  hurricanes their remnants occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall but are often weak by the time they reach washington partly due to the citys inland location.68 flooding of the potomac river however caused by a combination of high tide storm surge and runoff has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.69  precipitation occurs throughout the year.70

washington dc is a planned city in 1791, president washington commissioned pierre charles lenfant a french-born architect and city planner to design the new capital he enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston helped layout the city plan.75 the lenfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping.76 he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him.77 lenfants design also envisioned a garden-lined avenue approximately 1 mile in length and 400 feet wide in the area that is now the national Mall.78  lenfant plan for washington dc as revised by andrew ellicott in 1792  president washington dismissed lenfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capitals construction andrew ellicott who had worked with lenfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns lenfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.79  by the early 1900s, lenfants vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washingtons ceremonial core.33 what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved lenfants intended design.76  the construction of the 12-story cairo apartment building in 1894 spurred the citys first building height restrictions  by law washingtons skyline is low and sprawling the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet despite popular belief no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555-foot washington Monument,52 which remains the districts tallest structure city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl.80  the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area northwest northeast southeast and southwest the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the us capitol building.81 all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol most streets are set out in a grid pattern with eastwest streets named with letters c street sw northsouth streets with numbers 4th street nw and diagonal avenues many of which are named after states.81  the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north florida avenue in 1890, rock creek to the west and the anacostia river to the east.3176 washingtons street grid was extended where possible throughout the district starting in 1888.82 georgetowns streets were renamed in 1895.32 some streets are particularly noteworthy such as pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the capitol and k street which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.83 washington hosts 177 foreign embassies constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally known as embassy Row.84  architecture  the white house ranked second on the aias of americas favorite architecture in 2007.  the architecture of washington varies greatly six of the top 10 buildings in the american institute of architects 2007 ranking of favorite architecture are in the district of Columbia85 the white house the washington national cathedral the thomas jefferson memorial the united states capitol the lincoln memorial and the vietnam veterans memorial the neoclassical georgian gothic and modern architectural styles are all reflected among those six structures and many other prominent edifices in washington notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the french second empire style such as the eisenhower executive office Building.86  outside downtown washington architectural styles are even more varied historic buildings are designed primarily in the queen anne chteauesque richardsonian romanesque georgian revival beaux-arts and a variety of victorian styles rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the civil war and typically follow federalist and late victorian designs.87 georgetowns old stone house was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city.88 founded in 1789, georgetown university features a mix of romanesque and gothic revival architecture.86 the ronald reagan building is the largest
