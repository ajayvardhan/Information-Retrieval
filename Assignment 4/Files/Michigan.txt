fires the ojibwe whose numbers are estimated to have been between 25,000 and 35,000, were the largest  the ojibwe were established in michigans upper peninsula and northern and central michigan and also inhabited ontario northern wisconsin southern manitoba and northern and north-central minnesota the ottawa lived primarily south of the straits of mackinac in northern western and southern michigan but also in southern ontario northern ohio and eastern wisconsin while the potawatomi were in southern and western michigan in addition to northern and central indiana northern illinois

century the first europeans to reach what became michigan were those of tienne brls expedition in 1622. the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where pre jacques marquette established sault ste marie michigan as a base for catholic missions.1213 missionaries in 167175 founded outlying stations at saint ignace and marquette jesuit missionaries were well received by the areas indian populations with relatively few difficulties or hostilities in 1679, robert cavelier sieur de la salle built fort miami at present-day st joseph in 1691, the french established a trading post and fort st joseph along the st joseph river at the present day city of niles  18th century  approximate area of michigan highlighted in guillaume de lisles 1718 map  in 1701, french explorer and army officer antoine de la mothe cadillac founded fort pontchartrain du dtroit or pontchartrain on-the-strait on the strait known as the detroit river between lakes saint clair and erie cadillac had convinced king louis xivs chief minister louis phlypeaux comte de pontchartrain that a permanent community there would strengthen french control over the upper great lakes and discourage british aspirations  the hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent1415 0.85 acres the equivalent of just under 200 feet per side and named it fort pontchartrain cadillacs wife marie thrse guyon soon moved to detroit becoming one of the first european women to settle in the michigan wilderness the town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post the glise de saint-anne of saint ann was founded the same year while the original building does not survive the congregation continues to be active today cadillac later departed to serve as the french governor of louisiana from 1710 to 1716. french attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the fox wars involving the meskwaki and their allies versus the french and their native allies  at the same time the french strengthened fort michilimackinac at the straits of mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire by the mid-18th century the french also occupied forts at present-day niles and sault ste marie though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by europeans france offered free land to attract families to detroit which grew to 800 people in
