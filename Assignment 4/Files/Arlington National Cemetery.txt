began construction of arlington house name is ultimately derived from the village of arlington gloucestershire england where custis family was originally from the estate passed to custis daughter mary anna who had married united states army officer robert e lee custis will gave a inheritance to mary lee allowing her to live at and run arlington estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it.4 upon her death the arlington estate passed to her eldest son george washington custis Lee.4  when virginia seceded from the union at the start of the american civil war robert e lee resigned his commission on april 20, 1861, and took command of the armed forces of the commonwealth of virginia later becoming commander of the army of northern Virginia.5 on may 7, troops of the virginia militia occupied arlington and arlington House.6 with confederate forces occupying arlingtons high ground the capital of the union was left in an untenable military position.7 although unwilling to leave arlington house mary lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by federal soldiers so she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds and left for her sisters estate at ravensworth in fairfax county virginia on may 14.89 on may 3, general winfield scott ordered brigadier general irvin mcdowell to clear arlington and the city of alexandria virginia of all troops not loyal to the united States.10 mcdowell occupied arlington without opposition on may 24.11  arlington house  at the outbreak of the civil war most military personnel who died in battle near washington dc were buried at the united states soldiers cemetery in washington dc or alexandria cemetery in alexandria virginia but by late 1863 both were nearly full.12 on july 16, 1862, congress passed legislation authorizing the us federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead and put the us army quartermaster general in charge of this program.12 in may 1864, union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the battle of the wilderness quartermaster general montgomery c meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery within weeks his staff reported that arlington estate was the most suitable property in the area.12 the property was high and free from floods might unearth graves it had a view of the district of columbia and it was aesthetically pleasing it was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the confederate states of america and denying robert e lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.13 the first military burial at arlington for william henry christman was made on may 13, 1864,14 close to what is now the northeast gate in section 27.15 however meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until june 15, 1864.16 arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until president harry s truman issued executive order 9981 on july 26, 1948.17  the old guard transports the flag-draped casket of the second sergeant major of the army george w dunaway who was buried with full military honors at arlington national cemetery  the government acquired arlington at a tax sale in 1864 for equal to today.18 mrs lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent attempting to pay the in property taxes to today assessed on the estate in a timely manner.19 the government turned away her agent refusing to accept the tendered payment in 1874, custis lee heir under his grandfathers will passing the estate in trust to his mother sued the united states claiming ownership of arlington on december 9, 1882, the us supreme court ruled 54 in lees favor in united states v lee deciding that arlington had been confiscated without due process.1920 after that decision congress returned the estate to him and on march 3, 1883, custis lee sold it back to the government for to in 2017 at a signing ceremony with secretary of war robert todd Lincoln.1821 the land then became a military reservation.22  president herbert hoover conducted the first national memorial day ceremony in arlington national cemetery on may 30, 1929.23  freedmens villageedit  beginning in 1863, the federal government used the southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery as a settlement for freed slaves giving the name of village to the land the government constructed rental houses that 1,100 to 3,000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming 1,100 acres of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training during the civil war and after war ended.2124 however after the land became part of a military reservation the government asked the villagers to leave when some remained john a commerford the superintendent of arlington national cemetery asked the armys quartermaster general in 1887 to close the village on the grounds that people living in the village had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as firewood.2225 the quartermaster general and the secretary of war then approved commerfords request.22 the last of the villages residents departed after the 56th united states congress appropriated in 1900 to settle the governments debts to them.22  recent expansionedit  with limited space but large numbers of world war ii korean war vietnam war and other veterans dying and wanting to be buried at arlington the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue in 1991, cemetery superintendent john c metzler jr implemented a million plan to clear a former 13 acres parking lot to create space for about 9,000 new grave sites.26  the cemetery received the authority to transfer 12 acres of woodland from the nps-controlled arlington house in 19962728 and 2001,2930 37 acres of land in 1999 from the dod that was the site of the navy annex building,3132 8 acres of land in 1999 from the department of the army that was part of fort Myer,3133 4 acres of land from arlington countys southgate road right-of-way in 2004,34 and just under 10 acres of land from fort myer in 2005.293536  gravestones at arlington national cemetery are marked by us flags each memorial day  in 2007, metzler implemented the millennium project a million expansion plan to begin utilizing the arlington woodland fort myer and navy annex land the project also included converting 40 acres of unused space and 4 acres of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments the millennium project expanded the cemeterys physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s, and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the american civil War.35 several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized metzlers plans as did the nps and the manager of arlington House.353637  on march 26, 2013, the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 law 113-6 appropriated to the dod million to plan design and construct the millennium Project.38 the legislation additionally appropriated to the dod million to study plan and design a future expansion of the cemeterys burial space.38  navy annex property expansion controversyedit  in 1998, a congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the navy annex and fort myer then occupied led to concerns that arlington county officials had not been properly consulted leading to the withdrawal of the proposal.39 however the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 law 106-65, which was enacted into law during october 1999, subsequently required the secretary of defense to transfer to the secretary of the army administrative jurisdiction of the 36 acres navy annex property the act required the secretary of defense to demolish the annexs buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery while requiring the secretary of the army to incorporate the annex property into the cemetery.32  in january 2013, the county manager of arlington county virginia and the executive director of the army national military cemeteries of arlington national cemetery and the united states soldiers and airmens home national Cemetery40 signed a memorandum of understanding between the arlington county board and the department of the army to expand the cemetery even further under the tentative plan arlington county would give up the easement for southgate road lies between the navy annex property and the cemeterys 2012 boundary and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the navy annex site for a new southgate road in exchange the department of defense would give the navy annex parking lot to the county  the army would also transfer land west of south joyce street to columbia pike to arlington county additionally the commonwealth of virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the virginia department of transportation land bounded by south joyce street columbia pike and south washington boulevard the cloverleaf interchange between columbia pike and s washington blvd would be eliminated and the hairpin turn in columbia pike straightened to provide a safer more natural exit from s washington blvd onto columbia pike although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the commonwealth of virginias cooperation the mou if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery.41  however in december 2016, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 law 114-328 authorized the secretary of the army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from arlington county and the commonwealth of virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the southgate road south joyce street and washington boulevard right-of-ways including the washington boulvard-columbia pike interchange.42 the army then informed the arlington county government in june 2017 that the army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the county the army told the county that the army would use the entire navy annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about 5 acres of public land that arlington county then owned the army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about 7 acres of land located between columbia pike and interstate 395 that the commonwealth of virginia then owned.43  arlington woods expansion controversyedit  a portion of arlington woods on humphreys drive  on february 22, 1995, officials of the united states department of the interior and the united states department of the army signed an agreement to transfer from arlington house the robert e lee memorial to the army a part of arlington woods which was located in section 29 of the nps at arlington national cemetery between arlington house and fort Myer.44 the property transfer which involved 12 acres of nps land was intended to permit metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries.2845  environmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the 24 acres remnant of an historically important stand of native trees.3746 a historical marker near the woodland notes that while visiting arlington house in 1825, gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette had warned mary lee fitzhugh custis the wife of george washington parke custis these forest trees around your mansion recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow the marker further notes that the virginia native plant society had recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in Virginia.47  on september 23, 1996, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 law 104-201 authorized the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army all of the land in section 29 that was within an national cemetery interment zone and some of the land in the section that was within a e lee memorial preservation Zone.2728  on march 5, 1998, the nps which is a component of the department of the interior informed the national capital planning commission that it wanted to transfer only 4 acres to the cemetery rather than the 12 acres that the 1995 agreement had described in response metzler stated was surprised but we will continue to work with the department of interior and see what happens.28  on july 12, 1999, the nps issued a federal register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment for the transfer.4548 the ea stated that the interment zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in arlington county this forest was the same type that once covered the arlington estate and had regenerated from trees that were present historically a forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old the interment zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources in addition to those in the preservation Zone.48 the ea described four alternative courses of action.48  in contrast to the npss march 1998 statement to the national capital planning commission the 1999 ea stated that the preferred alternative 1 would transfer to the cemetery approximately 9.6 acres comprising most of the interment zone and the northern tip of the preservation Zone.48 another alternative 3 would transfer to the cemetery the 12 acres interment zone while keeping the 12.5 acres preservation zone under nps jurisdiction.48 the ea concluded law 104-201 directed the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army jurisdiction over the interment zone which is the plan in alternative 3. adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law.48  map showing the millennium projects expansion of arlington national cemetery into arlington woods and fort myer  on december 28, 2001, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 law 107-107 repealed the part of public law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of section 29 to the secretary of the Army.30 the new legislation required the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army within 30 days the approximately 12 acres interment Zone.30 the transfer therefore involved the entire 12 acres of nps land that the 1995 agreement and alternative 3 in the 1999 ea had described  the 2001 legislation required the secretary of the army to use the interment zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium.30 in addition the legislation required the secretary of the interior to manage the remainder of section 29 perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for arlington house the robert e lee Memorial.30  on december 12, 2012, the united states army corps of engineers asked for comments on a draft ea that described a further expansion of arlington national cemetery as part of the millennium Project.495051 the 2012 draft ea was intended to implement conversion into burial space of the 17 acres of ft myer grounds as well as 10 acres of section 29 woodland the draft ea described seven alternatives the preferred alternative e called for the removal of about one-half of the 1,700 trees with a diameter of 6 inches or greater on the site about 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of arlington Woods.52 the draft ea concluded on the evaluation of environmental impacts no significant impacts would be expected from the proposed action therefore an environmental impact statement will not be prepared and a finding of no significant impact will be prepared and signed.52  on march 12, 2013, the corps of engineers released a revised ea for the millennium Project.5354 the revised ea contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft ea that had criticized the project and parts of the ea while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere.55 however the department of forestry of the commonwealth of virginia found that based on information in the draft ea the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the commonwealths forest resources.56 the revised ea did not change the preferred alternative e or the armys plans to prepare and sign the finding of no significant impact that the draft ea had described.57  on june 5, 2013, after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised ea the corps of engineers released a final ea and a signed fonsi for the millennium Project.5859 the final ea and the fonsi retained alternative e as the preferred alternative.58 the final ea stated that of the 905 trees to be removed 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches.6061 the project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than 2.63 acres area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a national register of historic places nomination form for arlington house had described in 1966.6062 about 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old.60 approximately 203 trees with ages of 50 to 145 years would be removed from a former picnic area.60 at a public hearing on july 11, 2013, the national capital planning commission approved the site and building plans for the millennium Project.63  2010 mismanagement controversyedit  main article arlington national cemetery mismanagement controversy  on june 9, 2010, united states secretary of the army john m mchugh reprimanded the cemeterys superintendent john c metzler jr and his deputy thurman higgenbotham after a dod inspector generals report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs buried coffins in shallow graves and buried bodies on top of one another.64 metzler who had already announced his intention to retire on july 2, 2010, admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement.64 the investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by management lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate.6566 both metzler and higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced.67  in march 2011, as a result of the problems discovered kathryn condon the recently appointed executive director of the army national military cemeteries announced that the cemeterys staff had been increased from 102 to 159. she added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because didnt have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do.68  the mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals which also proved controversial until 2005, the cemeterys administration gave free access with the familys permission to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery according to the washington post in 2008, the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005.69  management turnoveredit  after the cemeterys management controversy began to end the army appointed patrick k hallinan the acting superintendent of the cemetery in june 2010. he was promoted permanently to the position in october 2010. hallinan had previously worked for the office of field programs in the national cemetery administration an agency of the united states department of veterans affairs in that capacity hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries national cemetery policy procedures and operations.70 hallinan was promoted to executive director of the army national military cemeteries upon the retirement of kathryn condon in spring 2014.71  in may 2014, hallinan stepped down and was replaced by jack e lechner jr as superintendent of the cemetery lechner had been a funeral director for 10 years in the private sector before joining the us army he rose to the rank of colonel in november 2011, having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the supply division of the joint chiefs of staff overseeing the equipping of iraqi and afghanistan national security forces since june 2010, he had served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of the cemetery under Hallinan.71  the army removed lechner as superintendent of the cemetery in early august 2015 after a performance review into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader the army declined to elaborate further and appointed hallinan to be the temporary cemetery superintendent until the army could find a successor.72  wreaths across americaedit  wreaths laid at arlington national cemetery december 2013  beginning in 1992, the morrill worcester wreath company in harrington maine had a surplus at the end of the holiday season recalling a boyhood trip to the cemetery worcester donated to the cemetery 5,000 wreaths to honor the cemeterys dead with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company after thirteen years of similar donations in 2005 a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the internet thousands of people called worcester wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries.73  in 2006, over 150 different locations simultaneously held ceremonies with arlingtons additionally the project had its first veterans honor parade with guard riders who escorted the wreaths from maine to the cemetery the parade which is held each year now visits schools monuments veterans homes and communities along its route.73  at the end of 2006, worcesters company supplied wreaths to over 230 state and national cemeteries and veterans monuments across the country.74 assisted by veterans and truckers worcester established in 2007 a nonprofit organization named across America.73 in december 2008, the united states senate agreed to a resolution that designated december 13, 2008, as wreaths across america Day.75  in 2014, volunteers placed over 700,000 memorial wreaths at 1,000 locations in the united states and overseas including the uss arizona memorial at pearl harbor bunker hill valley forge and the national september 11 memorial at the world trade center site in new york city during that year volunteers were able to place wreaths in all sections of the cemetery for the first time.73 in 2016, this number increased to 1.2 million wreaths being placed at more than 1,230 cemeteries across the nation.76  conflict of interest charges have been made against wreaths across america because this charity has an exclusive for-profit supplier worcestor wreath company also run by the morrill family in the same town the charitys purchases of wreaths from this company account for most of the companys revenue and profits in late 2015, the wall street journal reported serious conflicts of interest with potential malfeasance in governance and contracting.77 in 2015 alone the wsj reported profits of over million on sales of over 850,000 wreaths to the charity raising concerns about competitive bidding reporting that several competitors had asked to bid significantly below the price offered by worcestor wreath company but were denied access  150th anniversaryedit  during may and june 2014, the cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a month-long series of events tours and lectures.78 during these celebrations cemetery officials formally re-designated the old amphitheater as the james tanner amphitheater james r tanner was a union army officer who lost both legs during the war he later became a war department stenographer and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the assassination of abraham lincoln he later was active in the grand army of the republic a union army veterans group tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater.79  sectionsedit  arlington national cemetery  the cemetery is divided into 70 sections with some sections in the southeast and western part of the cemetery reserved for future expansion.80 section 60, in the southeast part of the cemetery is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the global war on terror since 2001.81 section 21, also known as the nurses section is the area of arlington national cemetery where many nurses are buried and is the site of the spanish-american war nurses memorial and the nurses Memorial.82 another sectionchaplains hillincludes monuments to jewish protestant and roman catholic military chaplains in 1901, confederate soldiers buried at the soldiers home and various locations within arlington were reinterred in a confederate section that was authorized by congress in 1900. on june 4, 1914, the united daughters of the confederacy dedicated the confederate memorial designed by moses ezekiel upon his death in 1917, ezekiel was buried at the base of the monument as he was a veteran of the confederate army.83 all confederate headstones in this section are peaked rather than rounded.84 more than 3,800 former slaves called during the civil war are buried in section 27. their headstones are designated with the word or  grave markers niches and headstonesedit  the united states department of veterans affairs oversees the national cemetery administrations orders86 for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased submitted with information provided by the next of kin87 that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers the department of veterans affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceaseds faith.88 this number has grown in recent years due to legal challenges to policy.89  prior to 2007, the united states department of veterans affairs did not allow the use of the pentacle as an of belief on tombstones in military cemeteries this policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on april 23 following a series of lawsuits by the family of patrick stewart against the VA.909192  between 1947 and 2001, privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery the sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections.93 nevertheless the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001, including an artillery piece.94  there are 32 commonwealth war dead burials and some headstones are commonwealth war graves commission style  arlington memorial amphitheateredit  main article arlington memorial

persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes as defined in 38 us code 2411. capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence or without parole the reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent timothy mcveigh from being eligible at arlington national cemetery but it has since been amended to prevent others.109  also prohibited under the same statute are those determined with clear and convincing evidence to have avoided such conviction by death or flight

visitor requirementsedit  president donald trump participates in the memorial day ceremony  the cemetery has within recent years announced policies and procedures that limit visitor access to the cemeterys grounds the cemeterys executive director has stated that some of these may create delays for visitors some have become controversial  bicycle use policyedit  on august 6, 2013, patrick hallinan executive director army national military cemeteries issued an official memorandum that contained the cemeterys then-current bicycle use policy.115116 the memorandum permitted cyclists to travel in only one direction on only one route unless otherwise authorized by the executive director.116 this line route traveled from the old post chapel gate at joint base myer-henderson hall towards the main entrance of the cemetery at memorial avenue using meigs drive sherman drive and schley Drive.116 the memorandum stated without explanation bicycle traffic will not be permitted to travel in the reverse direction  cyclists could only use this route between 800 am and 645 pm from april 1 to september 30 and between 800 am and 445 pm from october 1 to march 31.116 cyclists had to wear bicycle helmets that certain designated organizations had approved.116 bicycles had to be equipped with headlights tail lights or red reflectors in lieu of tail lights regardless of the time of travel.116  on may 11, 2016, the department of the army published in the federal register a proposed rule that would among other things prohibit a visitor to an army national military cemetery national cemetery and the united states soldiers and airmens home national cemetery from riding a bicycle without first acquiring a pass to visit a relatives gravesite or columbarium niche.117 after receiving 13 comments from 13 individuals concerning the use of bicycles in the cemetery comments from representatives of the arlington county board and local bicycle advocacy groups that opposed the new restrictions the department of the army published a final rule in the federal register on september 26, 2016, that implemented the proposed rule effective october 26, 2016.118  in accordance with the final rule the cemetery issued a new bicycle use policy effective october 26, 2016. the policy stated that bicycling would no longer be allowed on cemetery grounds without a family pass the policy further stated that traversing the cemetery grounds do impact funeral services and the experience that families expect and deserve as they visit their loved ones grave as there are no bike paths on the cemetery grounds mixing cyclists with pedestrians and vehicles creates a safety hazard.119  security proceduresedit  in september 2016, hallinan announced that the cemetery was increasing security measures for its visitors in addition to random identification checks and other security measures already in place the cemetery will require pedestrians to enter at set access points the main entrance on memorial avenue the ord and weitzel gate and the old post chapel gate at joint base myer-henderson hall before entering the cemetery through its main entrance all pedestrians will be screened through the cemeterys welcome center all vehicle access will require presenting valid government-issued photo identification such as a drivers license or passport when entering the cemetery vehicles will also be subject to random inspections hallinan stated that these processes may result in delays when entering the cemetery.120  in popular cultureedit  in batman v superman dawn of justice the
