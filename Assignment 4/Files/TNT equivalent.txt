the of tnt is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules,1 which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton kilograms or one megagram of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite

megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact.2  historical derivation of the valueedit  a gram of tnt releases 26736702J upon explosion.3 the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184J,4 which is exactly one kilocalorie  an explosives energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686Jg from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853Jg.5  the measured pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 2724J,6clarification needed but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations  alternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared.78910  a kiloton of tnt can be visualized as a cube of tnt 8.46 metres on a side  grams
