of old persian the language of the achaemenid Empire.101112 its grammar is similar to that of many contemporary european languages.13 persian gets its name from its origin at the capital of the achaemenid empire persis fars province hence the name persian a persian-speaking person may be referred to as Persophone.15  there are approximately 110 million persian speakers worldwide with the language holding official status in iran afghanistan and tajikistan for centuries persian has also been a prestigious cultural language in other regions of western asia central asia and south asia by the various empires based in the regions.16  persian has had a considerable lexical influence on neighboring languages particularly the turkic languages in central asia caucasus and anatolia neighboring iranian languages as well as armenian georgian and indo-aryan languages especially urdu register of hindustani it also exerted some influence on arabic particularly bahrani Arabic,17 while

other western iranian languages are the kurdish languages gilaki mazanderani talysh and balochi persian is classified as a member of the southwestern subgroup within western iranian along with lari kumzari and Luri.23  etymologyedit  persian language name in persianedit  in persian the language is known by several names  western persian parsi prsi or farsi frsi or zabn-e frsi has been the name used by all native speakers until the 20th century in recent decades some authors writing in english have referred to the variety of persian spoken in iran as Farsi2425 although the name persian is also still widely used.262728  eastern persian dari persian dar or frsi-ye dari was originally a synonym for frsi but since the latter decades of the 20th century has become the name for the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan where it is one of the two official languages it is sometimes called afghan persian in English.29  tajiki tojik or zabon-i tojiki is the variety of persian spoken in tajikistan and uzbekistan by the tajiks  persian language name in englishedit  persian the historically more widely used name of the language in english is an anglicized form derived from latin latin persia greek perss a hellenized form of old persian Prsa.31 according to the oxford english dictionary the term persian as a language name is first attested in english in the mid-16th century.32 native iranian persian speakers call it Frsi.33 farsi is the arabicized form of prsi subsequent to muslim conquest of persia due to a lack of the phoneme in standard arabic the was replaced with an the origin of the name farsi and the place of origin of the language which is fars province is the arabicized form of Prs.343536 in english this language has historically been known as persian though farsi has also gained some currency farsi is encountered in some linguistic literature as a name for the language used both by iranian and by foreign authors.37  in modern english the word farsi refers to the language while parsi parsee describes zoroastrians particularly in south asia  the academy of persian language and literature has declared that the name persian is more appropriate as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity.38 some persian language scholars such as ehsan yarshater editor of encyclopdia iranica and university of arizona professor kamran talattof have also rejected the usage of in their articles.3940  the international language-encoding standard iso 639-1 uses the code fa as its coding system is mostly based on the local names the more detailed standard iso 639-3 uses the name fas for the dialect continuum spoken across iran and afghanistan this consists of the individual languages dari persian and iranian Persian.41  currently voice of america bbc world service deutsche welle and radio free europeradio liberty use service for their broadcasts in the

is an iranian language belonging to the indo-iranian branch of the indo-european family of languages in general iranian languages are known from three periods usually referred to as old middle and new periods these correspond to three eras in iranian history old era being the period from sometime before achaemenids the achaemenid era and sometime after achaemenids is to 400300 bc middle era being the next period most officially sassanid era and sometime in post-sassanid era and the new era being the period afterwards down to present day.43  according to available documents the persian language is only iranian language10 for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that old middle and new persian represent1044 one and the same language of persian that is new persian is a direct descendant of middle and old Persian.44  the known history of the persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods  old persianedit  main articles old persian and persian verbs  old persian  as a written language old persian is attested in royal achaemenid inscriptions the oldest known text written in old persian is from the behistun Inscription.45 examples of old persian have been found in what is now iran romania armenia bahrain iraq turkey and Egypt.4950 old persian is one of the oldest indo-european languages which is attested in original texts.51  xenophon a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc which is at a time when old persian was the only form of persian used he relates that the armenians spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.52  middle persianedit  main article middle persian  the complex grammatical conjugation and declension of old persian yielded to the structure of middle persian in which the dual number disappeared leaving only singular and plural as did gender middle persian developed the ezfe construction expressed through ye to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical system  although the period of the iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the achaemenid empire the transition from old to middle persian had probably already begun before the 4th century however middle persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the sassanid era inscriptions so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty moreover as a literary language middle persian is not attested until much later to the 6th or 7th century and from the 8th century onward middle persian gradually began yielding to new persian with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of zoroastrianism  the native name of middle persian was parsig or parsik after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest that is pars old persian parsa new persian fars this is the origin of the name farsi as it is today used to signify new persian following the collapse of the sassanid state parsik came to be applied exclusively to middle or new persian that was written in the arabic script from about the 9th century onward as middle persian was on the threshold of becoming new persian the older form of the language came to be erroneously called pahlavi which was actually but one of the writing systems used to render both middle persian as well as various other middle iranian languages that writing system had previously been adopted by the sassanids were persians ie from the southwest from the preceding arsacids were parthians ie from the northeast while ibn al-muqaffa century still distinguished between pahlavi parthian and persian arabic text al-farisiyah middle persian this distinction is not evident in arab commentaries written after that date  gernot windfuhr considers new persian as an evolution of the old persian language and the middle persian language53 but also states that none of the known middle persian dialects is the direct predecessor of modern Persian.5455 ludwig paul states language of the shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from middle to new Persian.56  new persianedit  ferdowsis shahnameh  persian is conventionally divided into three stages  early new persian centuries  classical persian centuries  contemporary persian century to present  early new persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of contemporary persian as the morphology and to a lesser extent the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable.57  early new persianedit  persian is taken to replace middle persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries under abbasid rule.58 with the decline of the abbasids began the reestablishment of persian national life and persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters new persian as an independent literary language first emerges in bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of sassanian middle persian court language called dari the cradle of the persian literary renaissance lay in the east of greater iran in greater khorasan and transoxiana close to the amu darya day Afghanistan.59  the mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from middle into new persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of iranian origin the tahirid dynasty saffarid dynasty and samanid empire and could develop only in range and power of expression.59  abbas of merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer persian tongue and after him the poems of hanzala badghisi were among the most famous between the persian-speakers of the time.60  the first poems of the persian language a language historically called dari emerged in Afghanistan.61 the first significant persian poet was rudaki he flourished in the 10th century when the samanids were at the height of their power his reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived although little of his poetry has been preserved among his lost works is versified fables collected in the kalila wa Dimna.16  the language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others central asian turks became familiar with islam and urban culture new persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th century.58 in the late middle ages new islamic literary languages were created on the persian model ottoman turkish chagatai and urdu which are regarded as daughter languages of Persian.58  classical persianedit  see also list of persian poets and authors  kalilah va dimna an influential work in persian literature  persian loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval persia used in literature and poetry this is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the turko-mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries and under restored persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuries.62  persian during this time served as lingua franca of greater persia and of much of the indian subcontinent it was also the official and cultural language of many islamic dynasties including the samanids buyids tahirids ziyarids the mughal empire timurids ghaznavids seljuqs khwarazmians the sultanate of rum the shirvanshahs safavids afsharids zands qajars ottomans and also many mughal successors such as the nizam of hyderabad persian was the only non-european language known and used by marco polo at the court of kublai khan and in his journeys through China.63  use in asia minoredit  persian on an ottoman miniature  despite anatolia having been ruled at various times prior to the middle ages by various persian-speaking dynasties originating in iran the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the sasanian empire centuries later however the practise and usage of persian in the region would be strongly revived a branch of the seljuks the sultanate of rum took persian language art and letters to Anatolia.64 they adopted persian language as the official language of the empire.65 the ottomans which can roughly be seen as their eventual successors took this tradition over persian was the official court language of the empire and for some time the official language of the empire.66 the educated and noble class of the ottoman empire all spoke persian such as sultan selim i despite being safavid irans archrival and a staunch opposer of shia Islam.67 it was a major literary language in the empire.68 some of the noted earlier persian works during the ottoman rule are idris bidlisis hasht bihisht which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight ottoman rulers and the salim-namah a glorification of selim I.67 after a period of several centuries ottoman turkish was highly persianised itself had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation.69 however the number of persian and arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88.69  use in south asiaedit  main article persian language in south asia  see also persian and urdu  persian poem agra fort india 18th century  persian poem takht-e shah jahan agra fort india  the persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in west asia europe central asia and south asia following the turko-persian ghaznavid conquest of south asia persian was firstly introduced in the region by turkic central Asians.70 the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianized central asian turkic and afghan dynasties.64 for five centuries prior to the british colonization persian was widely used as a second language in the indian subcontinent due to the admiration the mughals were of turco-mongol origin had for the foreign language it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole language under the mughal emperors beginning in 1843, though english and hindustani gradually replaced persian in importance on the subcontinent.71 evidence of persians historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the indian subcontinent words borrowed from persian are still quite commonly used in certain indo-aryan languages especially urdu also historically known as hindustani there is also a small population of zoroastrian iranis in india who migrated around 16th-18th century to escape religious execution in qajar iran and speak a dari dialect  contemporary persianedit  a variant of the iranian standard isiri 9147 keyboard layout for persian  in the 19th century under the qajar dynasty the dialect spoken in tehran rose to prominence this became the basis of what is now known as standard persian  there is still substantial arabic vocabulary but many of these words have been integrated into persian phonology and grammar in addition since the 19thcentury numerous russian french and english terms have been borrowed especially vocabulary related to technology the iranian national academy of persian language and literature is responsible for evaluating neologisms in order to devise their persian equivalents  varietiesedit  there are three modern varieties of standard persian  western persian iranian persian or farsi is spoken in iran and by minorities in iraq and the persian gulf states  dari persian afghan persian or dari is spoken in afghanistan  tajiki persian is spoken in tajikistan and uzbekistan it is written in the cyrillic script  all these three varieties are based on the classic persian literature and its literary tradition there are also several local dialects from iran afghanistan and tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard persian the hazaragi dialect central afghanistan and pakistan herati western afghanistan darwazi afghanistan and tajikistan and the tehrani accent iran the basis of standard iranian persian are examples of these dialects persian-speaking peoples of iran afghanistan and tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility.72  the following are some languages closely related to persian or in some cases are considered dialects  luri lori

modern tehran persian  historically persian has distinguished length early new persian had a series of five long vowels and along with three short vowels and at some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern iran and merged into and and merged into thus older contrasts such as shr vs shr and zd vs zr were lost however there are exceptions to this rule and in some words and are preservedcitation needed or merged into the diphthongs and are descendants of the diphthongs and in early new persian instead of merging into and examples of the exception can be found in words such as  however in dari the archaic distinction of and known as y-ye majhl and y-ye marf is still preserved as well as the distinction of and as ww-e majhl and ww-e marf on the other hand in standard tajik the length distinction has disappeared and merged with and with therefore contemporary afghan dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of early new persian  according to most studies on the subject samareh 1977, pisowicz 1985, najafi 2001, the three vowels traditionally considered long are currently distinguished from their short counterparts by position of articulation rather than by length however there are studies hayes 1979, windfuhr 1979 that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system with and phonologically long or bimoraic and and phonologically short or monomoraic  there are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the iranian system as toosarvandani 2004. that offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity which often suggests that modern persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of classical persian and a hypothetical future persian which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature  the length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties tajik

main article persian grammar  morphologyedit  suffixes predominate persian morphology though there are a small number of prefixes.79 verbs can express tense and aspect and they agree with the subject in person and number.80 there is no grammatical gender in persian and pronouns are not marked for natural gender  syntaxedit  normal declarative sentences are structured as v sentences have optional subjects prepositional phrases and objects followed by a compulsory verb if the object is specific the object is followed by the word r and precedes prepositional phrases r V.80  vocabularyedit  main article persian vocabulary  native word formationedit  persian makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes stems nouns and adjectives persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns adjectives and verbal stems new words are extensively formed by compounding two existing words combining into a new one as is common in german  influencesedit  see also list of english words of persian origin list of french loanwords in persian and iranian languages comparison table of the iranian languages  while having a lesser influence on Arabic19 and other languages of mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of middle persian origin,13 new persian contains a considerable amount of arabic lexical items,101820 which were Persianized21 and often took a different meaning and usage than the arabic original persian loanwords of arabic origin especially include islamic terms the arabic vocabulary in other iranian turkic and indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from new persian not from arabic itself.81  john r perry in his article lexical areas and semantic fields of arabic estimates that about 24 percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20,000 words in current persian and more than 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern persian literature are of arabic origin the text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area it may approach 25 percent of a text in literature.82 among the arabic loan words relatively few percent are from the semantic domain of material culture while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life.83 most of the arabic words used in persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in Persian.84  the inclusion of mongolian and turkic elements in the persian language should also be mentioned,85 not only because of the political role a succession of turkic dynasties played in iranian history but also because of the immense prestige persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider islamic world which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a turkic background the turkish and mongolian vocabulary in persian is minor in comparison to that of arabic and these words were mainly confined to military pastoral terms and political sector administration etc..86 new military and political titles were coined based partially on middle persian arte for instead of the uzbek qoshin sarlakar darybn etc in the 20th century persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages especially other indo-european languages such as Armenian,87 urdu and a lesser extent hindi the latter two through conquests of persianized central asian turkic and afghan invaders88 turkic languages such as ottoman turkish chagatai tatar Turkish,89 turkmen Azeri,90 uzbek and Karachay-Balkar91 caucasian languages such as Georgian,92 and to a lesser extent avar and Lezgin93 afro-asiatic languages like assyrian of loanwords in assyrian neo-aramaic and Arabic94 and even dravidian languages indirectly especially telugu and brahui as well as austronesian languages such as indonesian and malay persian has also had a significant lexical influence via turkish on albanian serbian croatian bosnian and serbo-croatian particularly as spoken in bosnia and herzegovina  use of occasional foreign synonyms instead of persian words can be a common practice in everyday communications as an alternative expression in some instances in addition to the persian vocabulary the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used for example in iranian colloquial persian in afghanistan or tajikistan the phrase you may be expressed using the french word merci however on the first syllable the hybrid persian-arabic phrase moteakker am moteakker being in arabic commonly pronounced motakker in persian and the verb am meaning am in persian or by the pure persian phrase seps-gozr am

variant of the arabic alphabet which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in arabic tajik persian as used in tajikistan is typically written in a modified version of the cyrillic script there also exist several romanization systems for persian after the muslim conquest of persia it took approximately 150 years before persians adopted the arabic script in place of the older alphabet previously two different scripts were used pahlavi used for middle persian and the avestan alphabet persian dndapirak or din dabireliterally religion script used for religious purposes primarily for the avestan but sometimes for middle persian  in the modern persian script historically short vowels are usually not written only the historically long ones are represented in the text so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing western persian kerm karam kerem and krom are all spelled krm in persian the reader must determine the word from context the arabic system of vocalization marks known as harakat is also used in persian although some of the symbols have different pronunciations for example a ammah is pronounced while in iranian persian it is pronounced this system is not used in mainstream persian literature it is primarily used for teaching and in some not all dictionaries  there are several letters generally only used in arabic loanwords these letters are pronounced the same as similar persian letters for example there are four functionally identical letters for three letters for two letters for two letters for on the

nearly 1,500 years the cultural influence of these rough nomads on irans refined civilization remained extremely tenuous this is demonstrated by the mediocre linguistic contribution for which exhaustive statistical studies have been made the number of turkish or mongol words that entered persian though not negligible remained limited to 2,135, ie 3 percent of the vocabulary at the most these new words are confined on the one hand to the military and political sector administration etc and on the other hand to technical pastoral terms the contrast with arab influence is striking while cultural pressure of the arabs on iran had been intense they in no way infringed upon the entire iranian territory whereas with the turks whose contributions to iranian civilization were modest
