august 2001 on space shuttle discovery during mission STS-105 and took control of the complex on 13 august 2001. the crew conducted a science-intensive increment and completed four spacewalks the expedition three crew ended their 117-day residency on board the iss on 8 december 2001 when their custom soyuz seat-liners were transferred to space shuttle endeavour for the return trip home during mission STS-108.  the expedition three crew of the international space station enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 leonid meteor storm looked like we were seeing ufos approaching the earth flying in formation three or four at a time recalls astronaut frank culbertson were hundreds per minute going beneath us really spectacular news reports had warned sky watchers in advance on 18 november 2001, earth was due to plow through a minefield of debris shed by comet tempel-tuttle innumerable bits of comet dust would become meteors when they hit earths atmosphere at 144,000 miles per hour experts predicted an unforgettable display and it came millions of people saw the show but only three of themthe ones on board the space stationsaw it from above had to look down to see the meteors says culbertson because the atmosphere comet dust burns up is below the station  an international crew of three were the third crew to live aboard the international space station the team was led by american commander frank culbertson and joined by russian crewmates vladimir dezhurov mission pilot and flight engineer mikhail tyurin as a part of the STS-105 mission discovery delivered the expedition 3 crew to the station during their four-month stay the crew saw the orbital complex expand and research work grow the expedition 3 crew returned home on mission STS-108.  spacewalksedit

pirs and the stations zvezda service module the spacewalkers installed a cable that will allow space walk radio communications between the two station sections they also installed handrails on the new compartment then they installed an exterior ladder that will be used to help spacewalkers leave pirs hatch tyurin and dezhurov installed a strela cargo crane onto the station.23  expedition 3  eva 2

of investigations of how various materials react to the space environment over a long time called mpac-seeds the investigation is housed in three briefcase-sized containers.23  expedition 3  eva 3

they completed checks of the strela cargo crane using one space walker at the end of the cranes boom to simulate a cargo they also inspected and photographed a small panel of one solar array on the zvezda service module that has one portion of a panel not fully unfolded.23  expedition 3  eva 4  dezhurov  tyurin  3 december 2001  1320  3 december 2001  1606  2 hours 46 minutes  dezhurov and tyurin removed an obstruction that prevented a progress resupply ship from firmly docking with the international space station they also took pictures of the debris which was a rubber seal from the previous cargo ship and of the docking interface.3  mission patchedit  the expedition 3 mission patch depicts the book of space history turning from the chapter with the russian space station mir and the space shuttle to the next chapter one that will be written on the blank pages of the future by space explorers working for the benefit of the entire world above the book is a layout of what the station will look like when completed docked with the space shuttle  911 satellite picturesedit  iss picture of new york city on 911  on september 11, 2001, the international space station passed over
