list of retired philippine typhoon names  the philippine area of responsibility for tropical cyclone warnings  since 1963, there have been three agencies who have named tropical cyclones within the north western pacific ocean which has often resulted in a cyclone having two names from 1945 to 2000 the us navys joint typhoon warning center assigned names to tropical cyclones before the japan meteorological agency took over the naming of tropical cyclones in 2000. both agencies assigned names to tropical cyclones when they intensified into a tropical storm since 1963 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135E and 115E and between 5N-25N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it all three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the western pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones with pagasa retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least 70091000000000000001billion in damage and or have caused at least 300deaths within the philippines since 1963 the naming lists have been revised in 1979, 1985, 2001 and 2005 for various reasons including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons.12 within this list all information with regards to intensity is taken from while the system was in the philippine area of responsibility and is thus taken from pagasas archives rather than the jtwc or jmas archives  contents  1 pre 2000  2 2000s  3 2010s  4 see also  5 notes  6 references  7 external links  pre 2000edit  gathering of
