protection of ocean and coastal resources and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the environment in addition to its over 11,000 civilian employees,3 noaa research and operations are supported by 321 uniformed service members who make up the noaa commissioned officer Corps.4 noaa traces its history back to the convergence of multiple agencies the united states coastal and geodetic survey in 1807, the weather bureau and the bureau of commercial fisheries noaa was officially formed in 1970.5 the acting under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere at the department of commerce and the agencys interim administrator has been benjamin friedman since the end of the obama administration on January20, 2017.6 barry myers ceo of accuweather is proposed to

global community  a supplier of environmental information products noaa supplies to its customers and partners information pertaining to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere this is clear through the production of weather warnings and forecasts via the national weather service but noaas information products extend to climate ecosystems and commerce as well  a provider of environmental stewardship services noaa is a steward of us coastal and marine environments in coordination with federal state local tribal and international authorities noaa manages the use of these environments regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species  a leader in applied scientific research noaa is intended to be a source of accurate and objective scientific information in the four particular areas of national and global importance identified above ecosystems climate weather and water and commerce and transportation.8  the five activities are  monitoring and observing earth systems with instruments and data collection networks  understanding and describing earth systems through research and analysis of that data  assessing and predicting the changes of these systems over time  engaging advising and informing the public and partner organizations with important information  managing resources for the betterment of society economy and environment.9  historyedit  seal of the noaa commissioned corps  noaa was formed on october 3, 1970, after us president richard nixon proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for protection of life and property from natural hazardsfor a better understanding of the total environmentand for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources noaa formed a conglomeration of several existing scientific agencies that were among the oldest in the federal government they were the united states coast and geodetic survey formed in 1807 the weather bureau formed in 1870Geodetic survey and weather service had been combined by a 1965 consolidation into the environmental science services administration including the uniformed commissioned corp 1917 and the bureau of commercial fisheries formed in 1871. noaa was established within the department of commerce via the reorganization plan no 4 of 1970.10 in 2007, noaa
