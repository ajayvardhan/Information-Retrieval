cod is a geographic cape extending into the atlantic ocean from the southeastern corner of mainland massachusetts in the northeastern united states its historic maritime character and ample beaches attract heavy tourism during the summer months  as defined by the cape cod commissions enabling legislation cape cod is conterminous with barnstable county Massachusetts.2 it extends from provincetown in the northeast to woods hole in the southwest and is bordered by plymouth to the northwest  since 1914, cape cod has been separated from the mainland by the cape cod canal the canal cuts 17.5 miles roughly across the base of the peninsula though small portions of the cape cod towns of bourne and sandwich lie on the mainland side of the canal two highway bridges cross the cape cod canal the sagamore bridge and the bourne bridge in addition the cape cod canal railroad bridge carries railway freight and limited passenger services onto the cape cape territory is divided into 15 towns with

destinations attracting wealthy families celebrities and other tourists these include the large nearby islands of nantucket and marthas vineyard which have grown in population by 6.8 percent and 10.3 percent respectively between 2000 and 2010 while the year-round population of barnstable county dropped 3 percent according to the Census.3 both islands are also famous summer tourist destinations commonly accessed by ferry from several locations on the cape the phrases cape cod and the islands and the cape and islands are often used to describe the whole region of barnstable county dukes county marthas vineyard and the smaller elizabeth islands and nantucket county  several small islands right off cape cod including monomoy island monomoscoy island popponesset island and seconsett island are also in barnstable county  the forbes family-owned naushon island was first purchased by john murray forbes naushon is one of the elizabeth islands many of which are privately owned one of the publicly accessible elizabeths is the southernmost island in the chain cuttyhunk with a year-round population of 52 people several prominent families have established compounds or estates on the larger islands making these islands some of the wealthiest resorts in the northeast yet they retain much of the early merchant trading and whaling culture  cape cod in particular is a popular retirement area 27.8 of the population of barnstable county is 65 years old or older.,4 and the average age of residents is the highest of any area in new englandcitation needed by voter registration numbers democrats outnumber republicans by less in the three counties than in the whole of massachusetts to varying degrees.5  the bulk of the land in the area is glacial terminal moraine and represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast new england similar glacial formations make up long island in new york and block island in rhode islandcitation needed  geography and political divisionsedit  the dunes on sandy neck are part of the barrier beach that helps prevent coastal erosion  physical geography and boundariesedit  the name cod as it was first used in 1602, applied only to the very tip of the peninsula it remained that way for 125 years until the of cape cod was incorporated as the town of provincetown no longer in use over the ensuing decades the name came to mean all of the land east of the manomet and scusset rivers essentially along the line that became the cape cod canal the creation of the canal separated the majority of the peninsula from the mainland most agencies including the cape cod commission and the federal emergency management agency treat the cape as an island with regard to disaster preparedness groundwater management and the like.167 cape codders tend to refer to the land on the mainland side of the canal as though the legal delineation of cape cod coincident to the boundaries of barnstable county includes portions of the towns of bourne and sandwich that are located north of the canal  cape cod bay lies in between cape cod and the mainland bounded on the north by a horizontal line between provincetown and marshfield north of cape cod bay provincetown is massachusetts bay which contains the stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary located 5 miles north of provincetown the atlantic ocean is to the east of cape cod and to the southwest of the cape is buzzards bay the cape cod canal completed in 1916, connects buzzards bay to cape cod bay its creation shortened the trade route between new york and boston by 62 miles  cape cod extends 65 miles into the atlantic ocean with a breadth of between 120 miles and covers more than 400 miles of shoreline.9 its elevation ranges from 306 feet at its highest point at the top of pine hill in the bourne portion of joint base cape cod down to sea level  one of the biggest barrier islands in the world cape cod shields much of the massachusetts coastline from north atlantic storm waves this protection erodes the capes shoreline at the expense of its cliffs while protecting towns from fairhaven to marshfield  cape cod and the islands are part of a continuous archipelagic region consisting of a thin line of islands stretching west to include long island this region is historically and collectively known by naturalists as the outer lands  towns and villagesedit  barnstable county historical map 1890  cape cod incorporates all of barnstable county which comprises 15 towns bourne sandwich falmouth mashpee barnstable yarmouth harwich dennis

on cape cod is the only one to have adopted a city form of government whose legislative body is an elected 13-member council.1011 however like other smaller massachusetts cities barnstable retained its of barnstable moniker all of the other towns elect a 5-member board of selectmen as the executive policy-setting board and utilize town meetings as their legislative body.10  cape cod and the

famous woods hole oceanographic institution and marine biological laboratory as well as several other research organizations and is also the most-used ferry connection to marthas vineyard falmouth is composed of several separate villages including east falmouth falmouth village hatchville north falmouth teaticket waquoit west falmouth and woods hole as well as several smaller hamlets that are incorporated into their larger neighbors davisville hatchville falmouth heights quissett sippewissett and others.12 bourne is home to the massachusetts maritime academy in the village of buzzards bay

is home to the dexter grist mill the historic hoxie house heritage museums and gardens and the sandwich glass museum mashpee is the home of the mashpee wampanoag tribe of native americans  the mid-cape area includes the towns of barnstable yarmouth and dennis the area features many beautiful beaches including warm-water beaches along nantucket sound eg kalmus beach in hyannis which gets its name from one of the inventors of technicolor herbert kalmus this popular windsurfing destination was bequeathed to the town of barnstable by dr kalmus on condition that it not be developed possibly one of the first instances of open-space preservation in the us the mid-cape is also the commercial and industrial center of the region there are seven villages in barnstable including barnstable village centerville cotuit hyannis marstons mills osterville and west barnstable as well as several smaller hamlets that are incorporated into their larger neighbors craigville cummaquid hyannis port santuit wianno and others.14 the villages of yarmouth are south yarmouth west yarmouth and yarmouth port there are five villages in dennis including north dennis east dennis west dennis dennis port and south Dennis.15  the lower cape outer cape traditionally includes all of the rest of the cape or the towns of harwich brewster chatham orleans eastham wellfleet truro and provincetown in the present day the five outermost towns truro wellfleet eastham and orleans are more commonly and collectively known as the cape this area is home to the cape cod national seashore a national park that encompasses much of the outer cape including the entire east-facing coast from orleans to provincetown the outer cape is home to some of the most popular beaches in the united states such as nauset light beach and coast guard beach in eastham race point beach in provincetown ballston beach in truro and skaket beach in orleans the outer cape and the beaches in the area have become infamous for their summertime great white shark sightings along with numerous other shark species in the summer of 2012, a tourist was attacked and bitten by a great white shark off ballston beach in truro the outer cape is the least populated area of cape cod though provincetown has a city-like atmosphere during the summer season provincetown has become a major gay lesbian resort destination the town is regarded as one of the largest lgbt resort communities in the united states provincetown is also renowned for its historic fishing fleets and stellwagen bank a popular fishing ground and whale watching destination is located a few miles north of race point  and  the terms cape and cape and references to traveling cape or cape have long been a source of confusion for the uninitiated cape cod visitor who mistakenly associating with might get turned around by passages such as these from 1920  look of things is more ocean-like if one goes down the cape to Provincetown.16  every street in chatham is solidly paved and the old corner town of the cape is the natural goal of the traveler coming up the cape from Provincetown...17  there are many theories to explain the apparent paradox one is that the terms derive from early nautical navigation when one traveled to the east one went down the longitudinal scale zero at greenwich england additionally prevailing fair weather winds out of the southwest have been used as the basis for directional descriptions by european settlers and their descendants in eastern north america that is one would be traveling to the east with a westerly wind at ones back to this day on nearby marthas vineyard island is the western section and island is to the east  the arrival of the railroad during the nineteenth century reinforced the concept as train schedules between boston and cape cod always showed boston at the top the timetable for trains headed onto the cape would be read from the top down and those of returning trains would be read from the bottom up provincetown therefore despite being the capes northernmost town was the furthest that one could travel capes unique shape brought a new paradox along with the automobile and highway system when driving cape on us route 6 the final 30 miles from orleans to provincetown takes one in nearly every direction except east  the best known colloquial explanation however is that the shape of the peninsula as it appears on maps and charts resembles that of a human arm in that analogy the southern portion of the cape represents the arm chatham the elbow and the north-south portion is the arm or forearm going further some say provincetown is the curled hand or fist with race point and wood end at its knuckles and long point at the fingertips  in the late twentieth century as the cape began drawing more vacationers and artists on retreat the nautical nomenclature and potential confusion over directions have gradually been giving way to the simpler cape although the older terms are still used by some local residents  geologyedit  of america there stands in the open atlantic the last fragment of an ancient and vanished land worn by the breakers and the rains and disintegrated by the wind it still stands bold  henry beston the outermost house  cape cod was formed by retreating glaciers18  geologic makeup of cape cod  the bulk of the land on cape cod consists of glacial landforms formed by terminal moraine and outwash plains this represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast new england similar glacial formations make up long island in new york and block island in rhode island together these formations are known as the outer lands or more obscurely as the of stirling geologically speaking cape cod is quite young having been laid down some 16,000 to 20,000 years ago  most of cape cods geological history involves the advance and retreat of the laurentide ice sheet in the late pleistocene geological era and the subsequent changes in sea level using radiocarbon dating techniques researchers have determined that around 23,000 years ago the ice sheet reached its maximum southward advance over north america and then started to retreat many kettle ponds clear cold lakes were formed and remain on cape cod as a result of the receding glacier by about 18,000 years ago the ice sheet had retreated past cape cod by roughly 15,000 years ago it had retreated past southern new england when so much of earths water was locked up in massive ice sheets the sea level was lower truros bayside beaches used to be a petrified forest before it became a beach  coastal erosion by wave action buff in this map brings growth elsewhere by deposition of transported sediment in blue  as the ice began to melt the sea began to rise initially sea level rose quickly about 15 metres per 1,000 years but then the rate declined on cape cod sea level rose roughly 3 metres per millennium between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago after that it continued to rise at about 1 metre per millennium by 6,000 years ago the sea level was high enough to start eroding the glacial deposits that the vanished continental ice sheet had left on cape cod the water transported the eroded deposits north and south along the outer capes shoreline through a process known as longshore drift those reworked sediments that moved north went to the tip of cape cod the entire town of provincetown at the extreme tip of the cape is a spit consisting largely of deposited marine sediment that was eroded and transported from farther south along the shore those sediments that instead moved south created the islands and shoals of monomoy so while other parts of the cape have dwindled from the action of the waves these parts of the cape have grown through the deposition of sediment in just the last 6,000 years  this process continues today due to their exposure to the open ocean the cape and islands are subject to considerable coastal erosion geologists say that due to erosion the cape will be completely submerged by the sea within several thousand years.19 this erosion causes the washout of beaches and the destruction of the barrier islands for example the ocean broke through the barrier island at chatham during hurricane bob in 1991, allowing waves and storm surges to hit the coast with no obstruction consequently the sediment and sand from the beaches is being washed away and deposited elsewhere while this destroys land in some places it creates land elsewhere most noticeably in marshes where sediment is deposited by flowing water  cape cods aquifer consists of six hydrologically independent lenses from which all the towns on the cape obtain drinking water falmouth which got 43.5 of its 2015 water from long Pond.2021 contamination with industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs from septic systems is a concern.22  view of cape cod from the iss  climateedit  although cape cods weather23 is typically more moderate than inland locations on occasion it takes the brunt of extreme weather systems such as the blizzard of 2005 and hurricane bob because of the influence of the atlantic ocean temperatures are typically a few degrees lower in the summer and a few degrees higher in the winter than the adjacent mainland a common misconception is that the climate is influenced largely by the warm gulf stream current however that current turns eastward off the coast of virginia and the waters off the cape are more influenced by the cold canadian labrador current as a result the ocean temperature rarely gets above 65F except along the shallow west coast of the upper cape and along the southern coast sound where water temperatures can sometimes reach 70F or higher  cape cods climate is also known for a delayed spring season being surrounded by an ocean which is still cold from the winter however it is also known for an exceptionally mild fall season summer thanks to the ocean remaining warm from the summer the highest temperature ever recorded on cape cod was 104F in Provincetown,24 and the lowest temperature ever was 12F in Barnstable.25  the water surrounding cape cod moderates winter temperatures nearly enough to extend the humid subtropical climate zone to what could be its northernmost limit in eastern north america as the majority of cape cod is in usda hardiness zone 7a.26 consequently many subtropical indicator plant species typically found in more southerly latitudes are grown there including camellias ilex opaca magnolia grandiflora and albizia julibrissin however cape cod falls below the 72F threshold as the warmest month july averages around 68.25F therefore the climate may be better characterized as either a maritime climate or a humid continental climate on the northern coast of the upper and mid cape which is somewhat sheltered from the cooler onshore wind to the south  precipitation on cape cod and the islands of marthas vineyard and nantucket is the lowest in the new england region averaging slightly less than 40 inches a year parts of new england average 42 to 46 inches to 120cm. this is due to storm systems which move across western areas building up in mountainous regions and dissipating before reaching the coast where the land has leveled out the region does not experience a greater number of sunny days however as the number of cloudy days is the same as inland locales in addition to increased fog on average roughly 27 inches of snow which is about 17 inches less than boston falls in an average winter  once every five or six years a tropical storm accompanied by very high and potentially damaging winds and heavy rain will strike the region about once every 11 or 12 years a hurricane brings damaging winds and storm surges to the region several category 3 storms have struck cape cod since record-keeping began such as a hurricane in 1869, the 1938 new england hurricane and hurricane carol in 1954. strong category 2 storms such as the 1869 saxby gale hurricane edna in 1954, and hurricane bob in 1991, also caused considerable damage notable category 1 storms include the 1944 great atlantic hurricane and hurricane donna in 1960. other notable storms include the gale of 1815, which would likely have been rated a strong hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale and the so-called storm of october 31, 1991. the february 2013 noreaster produced winds in excess of 80 miles per hour and dropped over 24 inches of snow on some parts of cape cod the storm knocked out power to tens of thousands of cape cod residents some for up to two weeks  climate data for cape cod massachusetts  month  jan  feb  mar  apr  may  jun  jul  aug  sep  oct  nov  dec  year  record high f  61   57   77   81   88   90   95

understood the principles of sustainable forest management and were known to light controlled fires to keep the underbrush in check they helped the pilgrims who arrived in the fall of 1620, survive at their new plymouth colony  the wampanoag lost their lands through continued purchase and expropriation by the english colonists the documentary natives of the narrowland narrated by actress julie harris shows the history of the wampanoag people through cape cod archaeological sites  in 1974, the mashpee wampanoag tribal council was formed to articulate the concerns of those with native american ancestry they petitioned the federal government in 1975 and again in 1990 for official recognition of the mashpee wampanoag as a tribe in may 2007, the wampanoag tribe was federally recognized.29  historyedit  discovery by europeansedit  cape cod was a landmark for early explorers it may have been the of vinland mentioned by the norse voyagers the manomet river area up by the western end of the cape cod canal in the early 20th century is claimed by some to have been visited by leif Eiriksson,30 and a stone wall31 discovered in provincetown in 1805 is also claimed to have been built by his younger brother thorvald eiriksson around 1007 AD,32 when the keel of his ship was repaired in the harbor according to norse sagas he was killed later in the same journey and is said to have been returned to this spot for burial.33 however there is no tangible support of the presence of norse voyagers in cape Cod,34 and the view is not generally accepted by archaeologists or historians.3536  giovanni da verrazzano approached it from the south in 1524. he named marthas vineyard claudia after claude of france the wife of francis i of France.37 in 1525, portuguese explorer estvo gomes called it cabo de la arenas while sailing under the spanish crown.38  in 1602, bartholomew gosnold named the tip cape cod the surviving term and the ninth oldest english place-name in the U.S.39 samuel de champlain charted its sand-silted harbors in 1606, and henry hudson landed there in 1609. captain john smith noted it on his map of 1614, and at last the pilgrims entered the harbor and contrary to the popular myth of plymouth rock made their first landing near present-day provincetown on november 11, 1620. nearby in what is now eastham they had their first encounter with native americans  settlementedit  cape cod was among the first places settled by the english in north america the capes fifteen towns developed slowly aside from barnstable sandwich and yarmouth the final town to be established on the cape was bourne in 1884, breaking off from Sandwich.40 provincetown was a group of huts until the 18th century a channel from massachusetts bay to buzzards bay is shown on southacks map of 1717. the present cape cod canal was slowly developed from 1870 to 1914. the federal government purchased it in 1928.  the capes vegetation was depauperate and trees were scarce by the time that henry thoreau saw cape cod during his four visits over 1849 to 1857,41 because of early colonial settlement and intensive land use the settlers heated by fires and it took 10 to 20 cords to 80 m of wood to heat a home so they cleared most of cape cod of timber early on they planted familiar crops but these were unsuited to cape cods thin glacially derived soils for instance much of eastham was planted to wheat the settlers practiced burning of woodlands to release nutrients into the soil improper and intensive farming led to erosion and the loss of topsoil farmers grazed their cattle on the grassy dunes of coastal massachusetts only to watch horror as the denuded sands over richer lands burying cultivated fields and fences dunes on the outer cape became more common and many harbors filled in with eroded soils.42  by 1800, much of cape cods firewood had to be transported by boat from maine the paucity of vegetation was worsened by the raising of merino sheep that reached its peak in new england around 1840. the early industrial revolution occurred through much of massachusetts and rhode island but it mostly bypassed cape cod due to a lack of significant water power in the area the cape developed as a large fishing and whaling center as a result and also because of its geographic position after 1860 and the opening of the american west farmers abandoned agriculture on the cape by 1950, forests had recovered to an extent not seen since the 18th century  modern eraedit  cranberry picking in 1906  cape cod became a summer haven for city dwellers beginning at the end of the 19th century improved rail transportation made the towns of the upper cape accessible to bostonians such as bourne and falmouth at the beginning of the twentieth century the northeastern mercantile elite built many large shingled along buzzards bay the relaxed summer environment offered by cape cod was highlighted by writers including joseph c lincoln who published novels and countless short stories about cape cod folks in popular magazines such as the saturday evening post and the delineator  guglielmo marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission originating in the united states from cape cod at wellfleet the beach below the bluffs where his station was located is now called marconi beach in 1914, he began construction of a new transatlantic wireless receiver station in chatham and a companion transmitter station in marion in 1920, the stations were acquired by rca and in 1921, chatham began operations as a maritime radio station communicating to ships at sea using the callsign wcc wcc supported the communications of amelia earhart howard hughes admiral byrd and the hindenburg marconi chose chatham due to its vantage point on the atlantic ocean surrounded on three sides by water walter cronkite narrated a 17-minute documentary in 2005 about the history of the chatham station  much of the east-facing atlantic seacoast of cape cod consists of wide sandy beaches in 1961, a significant portion of this coastline already slated for housing subdivisions was made a part of the cape cod national seashore by president john f kennedy it was protected from private development and preserved for public use large portions are open to the public including the marconi site in wellfleet this is a park encompassing the site of the first two-way transoceanic radio transmission from the united states roosevelt used marconis equipment for this transmission  the kennedy compound in hyannis port was president kennedys summer white house during his presidency and the kennedy family continues to maintain residences on the compound president grover cleveland maintained a summer home in the gray gables section of bourne other notable residents of cape cod have included actress julie harris us supreme court justice louis brandeis figure skater todd eldredge composer and radio personality canary burton and novelists norman mailer and kurt vonnegut influential natives included patriot james otis historian and writer mercy otis warren jurist lemuel shaw and naval officer john percival  on october 28, 2015, a 6-foot-long blue

treasure when she went down in 1717, killing him and all but two of his 145 fellow sailors.44  beginning in 1797, lighthouses were erected along cape cod to aid in navigation highland light cape cod light is the oldest and tallest of these and remains as one of a number of working lighthouses on cape cod and the islands many of cape cods earliest lighthouses featured a light tower that was attached directly to and centered on the roof of the keepers dwelling a stairway to the lantern room was accessible only from the top floor of the house this came to be known as a cape cod style lighthouse yet today the only fully intact specimens are on the west coast of the united States.45  nauset light erected here in 1923 and moved to a safer location in 1996, is on the national register of historic places  most of cape cods lighthouses are operated by the us coast guard with some exceptions such as the nauset light which has been owned since 1997 by the cape cod national seashore park service and operated since 2004 in partnership between that agency and the non-profit nauset light preservation Society.46  in 1996, both highland light and nauset light were moved further from the shore because they were each at risk of being lost due to erosion by the sea highland light then 110ft from the ocean was moved 450ft to the west and nauset light 37ft from the bluff was moved
