caya hico meaning of islands.910  historyedit  main article history of the turks and caicos islands  the first inhabitants of the islands were arawakan-speaking tano people who crossed over from hispaniola sometime from ad 500 to 800. together with taino who migrated from cuba to the southern bahamas around the same time these people developed as the lucayan around 1200, the turks and caicos islands were resettled by classical tanos from hispaniola  soon after the spanish arrived in the islands in 1512,7 they began capturing the tano of the turks and caicos islands and the lucayan as slaves as workers in the encomienda system11 to replace the largely depleted native population of hispaniola the southern bahama islands and the turks and caicos islands were completely depopulated by about 1513, and remained so until the 17th century.1213141516  the first european documented to sight the islands was spanish conquistador juan ponce de len who did so in 1512.7 during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries the islands passed from spanish to french to british control but none of the three powers ever established any settlements  settlementedit  raking salt on a 1938 postage stamp of the islands  bermudian salt collectors settled the turks islands around 1680. for several decades around the turn of the 18th century the islands became popular pirate hideouts from 17651783, the islands were under french occupation and again after the french captured the archipelago in 1783.  after the american war of independence many loyalists fled to british caribbean colonies in 1783, they were the first settlers on the caicos islands they developed cotton as an important cash crop but it was superseded by the development of the salt industry  in 1799, both the turks and the caicos island groups were annexed by britain as part of the Bahamas.17 the processing of sea salt was developed as a highly important export product from the west indies with the labour done by african slaves salt continued to be a major export product into the nineteenth century  the 1852 lighthouse on grand turk  in 1807, britain prohibited the slave trade and in 1833, abolished slavery in its colonies british ships sometimes intercepted slave traders in the caribbean and some ships were wrecked off the coast of these islands in 1837, the esperanza a portuguese slaver was wrecked off east caicos one of the larger islands while the crew and 220 captive africans survived the shipwreck 18 africans died before the survivors were taken to nassau africans from this ship may have been among the 189 liberated africans whom the british colonists settled in the turks and caicos from 1833 to 1840.18  in 1841, the trouvadore an illegal spanish slave ship was wrecked off the coast of east caicos all the 20-man crew and 192 captive africans survived the sinking officials freed the africans and arranged for 168 persons to be apprenticed to island proprietors on grand turk island for one year they increased the small population of the colony by seven percent.18 numerous descendants have come from those free africans the remaining 24 were resettled in nassau the spanish crew were also taken there to be turned over to the custody of the cuban consul and taken to cuba for prosecution.19 an 1878 letter documents the africans and their descendants as constituting an essential part of the population on the islands.18  in 2004, marine archaeologists affiliated with the turks and caicos national museum discovered a wreck called the rock ship that subsequent research has suggested may be that of the trouvadore in november 2008, a cooperative marine archaeology expedition funded by the united states noaa confirmed that the wreck has artefacts whose style and date of manufacture link them to the Trouvadore.192021  political reorganisationedit  in 1848, britain designated the turks and caicos as a separate colony under a council president in 1873, the islands were made part of the

turks and caicos first general election in 1976, the peoples democratic movement under mccartney sought to establish a framework and accompanying infrastructure in the pursuit of an eventual policy of full independence for the islands however with the early death of mccartney confidence in the countrys leadership waned in 1980, the pdm agreed with the british government that independence would be granted in 1982 if the pdm was re-elected in the elections of that yearcitation needed that election was effectively a referendum on the independence issue and was won by the pro-dependency progressive national party which claimed victory again four years later with these developments the independence issue largely faded from the political scenecitation needed  however in the mid-2000s, the issue of independence for the islands was again raised in april 2006, pnp premier michael misick reaffirmed that his party saw independence from britain as the goal for the islands but not at the present time.37  in 2008, opponents of misick accused him of moving toward independence for the islands to dodge a commission of inquiry which examined reports of corruption by the misick Administration.38  administrative divisionsedit  main article districts of the turks and caicos islands  the turks and caicos islands are divided into six administrative districts in the turks islands

her,41 although he strongly denies the charge.42  on monday 16 march 2009, the uk threatened to suspend self-government in the islands and transfer power to the new governor gordon wetherell over systemic corruption.43  on 18 march 2009, on the advice of her uk ministers queen elizabeth ii issued an order in council giving the governor the power to suspend those parts of the 2006 constitution that deal with ministerial government and the house of assembly and to exercise the powers of government himself the order which would also establish an advisory council and consultative forum in place of the house of assembly would come into force on a date to be announced by the governor and remain in force for two years unless extended or revoked.44  on 23 march 2009, after the enquiry found evidence of probability of systemic corruption or other serious dishonesty misick resigned as premier to make way for a new unified government.45 politicians were accused of selling crown land for personal gain and misusing public funds.46 the following day galmo williams was sworn in as his replacement.4547 misick denied all charges and referred to the british governments debate on whether to remove the territorys sovereignty as to being re-colonised it is a backwards step completely contrary to the whole movement of history.46  suspension and reactionsedit  on 14 august 2009 after

supply vessel in between turks and caicos parliamentary under-secretary of state for foreign affairs chris bryant said of the decision to impose rule is a serious constitutional step which the uk government has not taken lightly but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management.48  the move was met with vehement opposition by the former turks and caicos government with misicks successor williams calling it a and stating that country is being invaded and re-colonised by the united kingdom dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one-man dictatorship akin to that of the old red china all in the name of good governance.48 despite this the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule.48 the british government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain home rule in two years or less and foreign office minister chris bryant said that elections would be held in 2011, sooner.49 governor wetherell stated that he would aim to a clean break from the mistakes of the past and create durable path towards good governance sound financial management and sustainable development wetherell added the meantime we must all learn to foster a quality of public spirit listen to all those who have the long-term interests of these islands at heart and safeguard the fundamental assets of the territory for future generations our guiding principles will be those of transparency accountability and responsibility i believe that most people in the turks and caicos will welcome these changes.48  new government formededit  on 12 june 2012 british foreign secretary william hague announced that fresh elections would be held in
