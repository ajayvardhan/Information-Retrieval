the costliest atlantic hurricane on record until surpassed by hugo in the following year as well as the most intense atlantic hurricane until hurricane wilma gilbert was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone that formed during the 1988 atlantic hurricane season and peaked as a category 5 strength hurricane that brought widespread destruction to the caribbean and the gulf of mexico gilbert was also one of the largest tropical cyclones ever observed in the atlantic basin at one point its tropical storm-force winds measured 575mi in diameter in addition gilbert was the most intense tropical cyclone in recorded history to strike Mexico.1  the tenth named storm and third hurricane of the 1988 atlantic hurricane season gilbert developed from a tropical wave on September8 while located 400mi east of barbados following intensification into a tropical storm the next day gilbert steadily strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward into the caribbean sea on September10, gilbert attained hurricane intensity and rapidly intensified into a Category3 hurricane on September11. after striking jamaica the following day rapid intensification occurred once again and the storm became a Category5 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale late on September13. gilbert then weakened slightly and made landfall on the yucatn peninsula later that day while maintaining Category5 intensity after landfall gilbert weakened rapidly over the yucatn peninsula and emerged into the gulf of mexico as a Category2 storm on September15. gradual intensification occurred as gilbert tracked across the gulf of mexico and the storm made landfall as a Category3 hurricane in mainland mexico on September16. the hurricane gradually weakened after landfall and eventually dissipated on September19 over the midwestern united states  gilbert wrought havoc in the caribbean and the gulf of mexico for nearly nine days in total it killed 318 people and caused about to in 2016 in damages

gilbert trace back to an easterly tropical wavean elongated low-pressure area moving from east to westthat exited the northwestern coast of africa on September3, 1988. over the subsequent days the wave traversed the tropical atlantic and developed a broad wind circulation extending just north of the equator the system remained disorganized until September8, when satellite images showed a defined circulation center approaching the windward islands the following day the national hurricane center classified it as the twelfth tropical depression of the annual hurricane season using the dvorak technique when it was located about 400mi east of barbados the depression proceeded toward the west-northwest and while moving through the lesser antilles near martinique it gained enough strength to be designated as tropical storm Gilbert.2  after becoming a tropical storm gilbert underwent a period of significant strengthening passing to the south of hispaniola it became a hurricane late on September10 and further strengthened to Category3 intensity on the saffirsimpson scale the next day at that time gilbert was classified as a major hurricane with sustained winds of 125mph and a minimum barometric pressure 960mbar 28.35inHg. on September12, the hurricane made landfall on the eastern coast of jamaica at this intensity its 15mi eye moved from east to west across the entire

strengthened rapidly after emerging from the coast of jamaica as the hurricane brushed the cayman islands a reporting station on grand cayman recorded a wind gust of 156mph as the storm passed just to the southeast on september 13. explosive intensification continued until gilbert reached a minimum pressure of 888mbar 26.22inHg with maximum sustained flight-level winds of 185mph having intensified by 72mbar in a space of 24 hoursnb 12 this pressure was the lowest ever observed in the western hemisphere and made gilbert the most intense atlantic hurricane on record until it was surpassed by hurricane wilma in 2005.1  gilbert made landfall for a second time on the island of cozumel and subsequently made landfall on mexicos yucatn peninsula on september 14 as a Category5 hurricane,25 making it the first Category5 hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin since hurricane david hit hispanola in 1979 the minimum pressure at landfall in cozumel was estimated to be 900mbar along with maximum sustained winds of 160mph the storm weakened quickly while crossing land before it emerged into the gulf of mexico as a Category2 hurricane.6 gilbert restrengthened rapidly however and made landfall for a final time as a Category3 hurricane near la pesca tamaulipas on september 16, with winds of about 125mph  on september 17, gilbert brushed the inland city of monterrey nuevo len before taking a sharp turn to the north the storm spawned 29 tornadoes in texas on september 18 before moving across oklahoma and being absorbed by a low-pressure system over missouri on september 19, finally becoming extratropical over lake Michigan.2  preparationsedit  hurricane gilbert making landfall in mexico on september 16.  late on september 10, a tropical storm warning was issued by the
