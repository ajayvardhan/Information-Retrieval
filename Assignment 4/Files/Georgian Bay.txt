formations and windswept eastern white pine are characteristic of the islands and much of the shoreline of the bay the rugged beauty of the area inspired landscapes by artists of the group of seven the western part of the bay from collingwood north and including manitoulin drummond cockburn and st joseph islands borders the niagara escarpment because of its size and narrowness of the straits

whom call themselves anishinaabe anishinaabeg lived along the northern eastern and western shores of georgian bay the huron wendat and tionontati inhabited the lands along the southern coast having migrated from the northern shores of lake ontario names of islands such as gitchi manitou the great spirit who left the bay as a source of life for the first people and tomb are indicative of the richness of the cultural history of the area aboriginal communities continue to live on their territories and practise their cultural traditions  the first european to visit this area was likely tienne brl who at age less than 20, in 1610 was sent to live as an interpreter trainee with the onontchataronon an algonquian people of the ottawa river they travelled every winter to live with the arendarhonon people of the huron confederacy at the southern end of georgian bay in the area now called brul returned to the arendarhonon the following year at the same time another young interpreter trainee a youth remembered only as thomas who was employed by the french surgeon and trader daniel boyer also likely made it to huronia in the company of the onontchataronon another member of the confederacy  in 1615, bruls employer the french explorer samuel de champlain made his own visit to georgian bay and overwintered in huronia he was preceded that summer by a rcollet missionary joseph

by captain william fitzwilliam owen who called it lake manitoulin captain henry bayfield who made more detailed charts of the bay renamed it in 1822 after king george iv his charts are the basis for those in use today  the canadian hydrographic service traces its history back to 1883, when it was originally established as the georgian bay survey tasked with charting and improving knowledge of the bay after a steamship wrecked there the previous year killing 150 of its passengers  over the years 32 lighthouses were built on georgian bay six of them were designed with limestone towers these were built in the 1850s and are known collectively as the imperial towers some of the 32 can be toured by the public some cannot and some are accessible only by tour boats or private boat.8  legend of

wanakita here he decided that this was the woman he wanted to marry and started planning the wedding immediately after she left but when she was invited back she told kitchikewana that she was already engaged enraged kitchikewana destroyed all the decorations running to one end of beausoleil island and grabbing a large ball of earth running to the other end he tossed it into the great lakes thus
