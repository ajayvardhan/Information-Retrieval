la nia  for the ship see nia  sea surface skin temperature anomalies in november 2007 showing la nia conditions  la nia spanish pronunciationla nia is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of el nio as part of the broader el niosouthern oscillation climate pattern the name la nia originates from spanish meaning little girl analogous to el nio meaning little boy it has also in the past been called anti-el niocitation needed and el viejo old man.1 during a period of la nia the sea surface temperature across the equatorial eastern central pacific ocean will be lower than normal by 3 to 5C. in the united states an appearance of la nia persists for at least five months it has extensive effects on the weather in north america even affecting the atlantic and pacific hurricane seasons  contents  1 definition  2 occurrences  3 impacts on the global climate  4 regional impacts  4.1 africa  4.2 asia  4.3 north america  4.4 south america  5 diversity  6 see also  7 references  8 external links  definitionedit  la nia is the positive phase of the el nio southern oscillation and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific Ocean.2 however each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la nia event which is tailored to their specific interests.3 for example the australian bureau of meteorology looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nio 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring that a la nia event has started.4 however the japan meteorological agency declares that a la nia event has started when the average five-month sea surface temperature deviation for the NINO.3 region is more than 0.5C cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer.5  occurrencesedit  a timeline of all la nia episodes between 1900 and 2017.67  there was a relatively strong la nia episode during 19881989. la nia also formed in late 1983,8 in 1995, and a protracted la nia event that lasted from mid-1998 through early 2001. this was followed by a neutral period between 2001 and 2002. the la nia which developed in mid-2007, and lasted until almost 2009, was a moderate one the strength of la nia made the 2008 atlantic hurricane season one of the five most active since 1944 sixteen named storms had winds of at least 39 miles per hour eight of which became 74-mile-per-hour or greater hurricanes.9  a new la nia episode developed quite quickly in the eastern and central tropical pacific in mid-2010,10 and lasted until early 2011.11 it intensified again in mid-2011 and lasted until early 2012.12 this la nia combined with record-high ocean temperatures in the north-eastern indian ocean was a large factor in the 20102011 queensland floods,13 and the quartet of recent heavy snowstorms in north america starting with the december 2010 north american blizzard the same la nia event was also a likely cause of a series of tornadoes of above-average severity that struck the midwestern and southern united states in the spring of 2011, and drought conditions in the south central states including texas oklahoma and Arkansas.14 meanwhile a series of major storms caused extensive flooding in california in december 2010, with seven consecutive days of non-stop rainfall leading to one of the wettest decembers in over 120 years of records this is in contrast to the drier-than-normal conditions typically associated with la nia in California.15  in 2011, on a global scale la nia events helped keep the average global temperature below recent trends as a result 2011 tied with 1997 for the eleventh-warmest year on record it was the second-coolest year of the 21st century to date and tied with the second-warmest year of the 20th century a relatively strong phase of la nia opened the year dissipated in the spring before re-emerging in october and lasted through the end of the year when compared to previous la nia years the 2011 global surface temperature was the warmest observed the 2011 globally-averaged precipitation over land was the second-wettest year on record behind 2010. precipitation varied greatly across the globe this la nia contributed to severe drought in east africa and to australias third-wettest year in its 112-year period of records.16  la nias occurred in 1904, 1908, 1910, 1916, 1924, 1928, 1938, 194951,17 195456, 1964, 197072, 197376, 198385,8 198889, 199596, 19982001, 200708, 201012 and 201617.101819  impacts on the global climateedit  la nia impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others.20  regional impactsedit  observations of la nia events since 1950, show that impacts associated with la nia events depend on what season it is.21 however while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur.21  africaedit  between 50,000 and 100,000 people died during the 2011 horn of africa drought.22  la nia results in wetter-than-normal conditions in southern africa from december to february and drier-than-normal conditions over equatorial east africa over the same period.23  asiaedit  during la nia years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shifts westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to China.24 in march 2008, la nia caused a drop in sea surface temperatures over southeast asia by 2C. it also caused heavy rains over malaysia the philippines and Indonesia.25  north americaedit  regional impacts of la nia  la nia causes mostly the opposite effects of el nio above-average precipitation across the northern midwest the northern rockies northern california and the pacific northwests southern and eastern regions meanwhile precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states is below average.26 this also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average hurricanes in the atlantic and fewer in the pacific  the synoptic condition for tehuantepecer winds is associated with high-pressure system forming in sierra madre of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front which causes winds to accelerate through the isthmus of tehuantepec tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts between october and february with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores-bermuda high pressure system wind magnitude is weaker during la nia years than el nio years due to the less frequent cold frontal incursions during la nia winters,27 with its effects can last from a few hours to six days.28  in canada la nia will in general cause a cooler snowier winter such as the near-record-breaking amounts of snow recorded in la nia winter of 20072008 in eastern Canada.2930  south americaedit  during a time of la nia drought plagues the coastal regions of peru and Chile.31 from december to february northern brazil is wetter than normal.31 la nia causes higher than normal rainfall in the central andes which in turn causes catastrophic flooding on the llanos de mojos of beni department bolivia such flooding is documented from 1853, 1865, 1872, 1873, 1886, 1895, 1896, 1907, 1921, 1928, 1929 and 1931.32  diversityedit  map showing Nio3.4 and other index regions  the traditional la nia also called eastern pacific la Nia,33 involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the last two decades nontraditional la nia were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly 1 and 2 is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific 3.4.34 the phenomenon is called central pacific la Nia,33 la nia the anomaly arises near the dateline or la nia is japanese for but different.3536 there are flavors of enso additional to ep and cp types and some scientists argue that enso exists as a continuum often with hybrid types.37  the effects of the cp la nia are different from those of the traditional ep la niaeg the recently discovered la nia leads to a rainfall increase over northwestern australia and northern murray-darling basin rather than over the east as in a conventional la Nia.36 also la nia modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over bay of bengal but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the indian ocean overall with the arabian sea becoming severely non-conductive to tropical cyclone formation.3839  the recent discovery of enso modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global warming.40 however comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979. generally there is no scientific consensus on howif climate change may affect ENSO.41  there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this enso a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction,4243 finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches,4445464748 or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme ENSO.4950  recent years when la nia modoki events occurred include 197374, 197576, 198384, 198889, 199899, 200001, 200809, 201011 and
