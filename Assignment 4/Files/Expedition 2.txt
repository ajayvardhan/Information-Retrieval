three-person crew stayed aboard the station from march to august 2001. in addition to station maintenance the crew assisted in several station assembly missions welcomed the first space tourist dennis tito and conducted some scientific experiments  the crew consisted of one russian commander yury usachev and two american flight engineers susan helms and james voss the three had been to the station briefly in the previous year during the 10-day mission STS-101 in may 2000.  the expedition 2 crew was brought to the station aboard space shuttle discovery during mission STS-102. the expeditions increment began when discovery docked on 10 march 2001, bringing expedition 1 to an endnasa 1 in addition to the space shuttle flights which brought the crew to and from the station there were two visiting space shuttle missions and one soyuz mission which docked with the iss during expedition two in august discovery returned to rotate the long-duration crews again bringing the crew of the next expedition the expedition 2 increment ended when discovery undocked from the station on 20 august 2001.NASA 1  contents  1 crew  1.1 prime crew  1.2 backup crew  2 mission highlights  2.1 launch and

having spent 163 days aboard the station and 167 days in space only voss performed a spacewalk on STS-101, along with jeffrey williams  during this expedition research facilities launched to the space station included a human research facility two express the processing of experiments to the space station racks one of which contains the active rack isolation system and the payload equipment restraint system they also prepared the destiny laboratory to enable upcoming experiments to be conducted.1  a major focus was on gaining a better understanding of how to protect crew members from radiation while working and living in space radiation exposure in high doses over long periods of time can damage human cells and cause cancer or injury to the central nervous systemnasa 5  launch and dockingedit  main article STS-102  the three-member expedition 2 crew successfully launched on 8 march 2001 on space shuttle discovery during mission STS-102. they docked with the international space station on 10 march but the expedition 2 increment didnt begin until the previous crew undocked from the station on 18 march  STS-100edit  main article STS-100  the first visitors to the station during expedition 2 was the crew of STS-100, when they docked space shuttle endeavour with the iss on 21 april 2001. they spent eight days docked to the station the primary objective of this mission was to deliver and install the Canadarm2 on the iss which is a robotic arm similar to the canadarm which is used on some space shuttle flightsnasa 6 a later mission in 2002, STS-111, would deliver a movable base platform which would allow the Canadarm2 to have a larger range  iss EP-1edit  on the day after the space shuttle undocked the russian spacecraft soyuz TM-32 docked to the station carrying two cosmonauts with previous spaceflight experience as well as dennis tito the first ever space tourist this 8 day mission is sometimes referred to as iss EP-1,3 ISS-2S,4 soyuz 2 taxi flightnasa 7 or simply by its launching spacecraft soyuz TM-32. the commander of this visiting mission was kazakh cosmonaut talgat musabayev who had previously been on two long-duration missions aboard the space station mir in the 1990s. the other crew member of iss EP-1 was yuri baturin who had one other spaceflight mir EP-4, which was a visiting mission to mir launched with the spacecraft soyuz TM-28.5 baturins first mission occurred during the long-duration mission mir EO-25, so he and musabayev had already been in space together prior to iss EP-1 in fact both were landed with the spacecraft soyuz TM-27 in august 1998.  STS-104edit  main article STS-104  in july space shuttle atlantis docked with the station for an eight-day visit as a part of STS-104. the main objective of this mission was to install the quest joint airlock onto the station  the STS-104 crew performed 3 spacewalks  first spacewalk joint airlock installation  the first spacewalk occurred on 15 july and focused on installation of the quest joint airlock the spacewalkers helped as susan helms using the stations robotic arm lifted the new station airlock from atlantis payload bay and moved it to the stations unity module during much of the 5 hour 59 minute spacewalk jim reilly worked from a foot platform attached to the end of the shuttles robotic arm operated by janet kavandi after the spacewalk crew members inside the station attached connections to the airlock to prevent thermal damage.6NASA 8NASA 9  second spacewalk  the second spacewalk which happened on 18 july lasted 6 hours 29 minutes the internal hatches between the shuttle and station were closed at the end of flight day 6 so atlantis cabin pressure could be lowered in preparation for the second spacewalk the major objective was to attach and connect an oxygen and a nitrogen tank susan helms operated the station arm to lift the tanks from the shuttles payload bay and maneuver them to the new airlock at the airlock mike gernhardt and jim reilly latched the tanks in place and connected cables and hoses the spacewalkers were able to get ahead of schedule and also install another oxygen tank leaving only one tank to be connected on the third spacewalk.6NASA 9NASA 10  third spacewalk  the third spacewalk which occurred on 21 july was the first spacewalk based out of the new quest joint airlock and lasted 4 hours 2 minutes primary objective was to install the final nitrogen tank outside the airlocknasa 978 this spacewalk tested a new protocol developed by former commercial diver mike gernhardt essentially exercising while breathing oxygen to purge nitrogen from the spacewalkers bodies.9  undocking and landingedit  main article STS-105  in august space shuttle discovery returned to the station during the mission STS-105, which carried the three expedition 2 crew members back down to earth they undocked from the station on 20 august 2001, marking the end of the expedition 2 increment  mission patchedit  the international space station expedition two patch depicts the space station as it appeared during the time the second crew was on board the station flying over the earth represents the overall reason for having a space station to benefit the world through scientific research and international cooperation in space the number 2 is for the second expedition and is enclosed in the cyrillic mks and latin iss which are the respective russian and english abbreviations for the international space station the united states and russian flags show the nationalities of the crew indicating the joint nature of the program when asked about the stars in the background a crew spokesperson said they the thousands of space workers throughout the iss partnership who have contributed to the successful construction of our international space stationnasa 11  science activitiesedit  an early image in experiment of physics of colloids in space taken during expedition 2. it shows the diffraction pattern of a colloidal crystal made from polymethyl methacrylate spheres index matched to the solvent  two science racks known as express racks no 1 and 2, were delivered to the station in april aboard STS-100. one of the experiments on express rack no 2 was the experiment of physics of colloids in spacenasa 12 several different colloid mixtures were studied and the analysis is still underwaynasa 13  referencesedit  a b c expedition 2. spacefactsde retrieved 3 january 2011.
