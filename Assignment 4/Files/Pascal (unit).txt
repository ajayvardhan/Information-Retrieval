and ultimate tensile strength it is defined as one newton per square metre.1 it is named after the french polymath blaise pascal  common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal 100Pa which is equal to one millibar and the kilopascal 1000Pa which is equal to one centibar  the unit of measurement called standard atmosphere is defined as 101325Pa and approximates to the average pressure at sea-level at the latitude 45N.2 meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in hectopascals.3  contents  1 etymology  2 definition  3 miscellaneous  4 uses  4.1 hectopascal and millibar units  5 see also  6 references  7 external links  etymologyedit  the unit is named after blaise pascal noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics and experiments with a barometer the name pascal was adopted for the si unit newton per square metre by the 14th general conference on weights and measures in 1971.4  definitionedit  the pascal can be expressed using si derived units or alternatively solely si base units as  where n is the newton m is the metre kg is the kilogram and s is the second.5  one pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre  miscellaneousedit  the unit of measurement called atmosphere or standard atmosphere is 101325Pa this value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards such as ISO2787 tools and compressors ISO2533 and ISO5024 in contrast iupac recommends the use of 100 kpa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances.7  the unicode computer character set has dedicated symbols U33A9 square pa and U33AA square kpa in the cjk compatibility block but these exist for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated.89  usesedit  this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article

is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch unit except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the us customary system including the united states  geophysicists use the gigapascal in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the earth  medical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and often displays the youngs modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals  in materials science and engineering the pascal measures the stiffness tensile strength and compressive strength of materials in engineering use because the pascal represents a very small quantity the megapascal is the preferred unit for these uses

1220GPa  the pascal is also equivalent to the si unit of energy density Jm3. this applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases but also to the energy density of electric magnetic and gravitational fields  in measurements of sound pressure or loudness of sound one pascal is equal to 94 decibels spl the quietest sound a human can hear known as the threshold of hearing is 0dBSPL, or 20Pa.  the airtightness of buildings is measured at 50Pa.11  hectopascal and millibar unitsedit  main article bar  the units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar which was close to the average air pressure on earth and the millibar since the introduction of si units meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals unit equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar.12131415161718 exceptions include canada which use kilopascals in many other fields of science the si is preferred which means pa with a prefix multiples of 1000 is preferred.1920  many countries also use the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation altimeter settings in practically all other fields the kilopascal pascals is used insteadcitation needed  see alsoedit  centimetre of
