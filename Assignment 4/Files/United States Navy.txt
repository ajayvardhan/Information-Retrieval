main article history of the united states navy  originsedit  it follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it everything honorable and glorious  george Washington18  the navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition which produced a large community of sailors captains and shipbuilders.19 in the early stages of the american revolutionary war massachusetts had its own massachusetts naval militia the rationale for establishing a national navy was debated in the second continental congress supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping defend the coast and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries detractors countered that challenging the british royal navy then the worlds preeminent naval power was a foolish undertaking commander in chief george washington resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going schooner uss hannah to interdict british merchant ships and reported the captures to the congress on 13 october 1775, the continental congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against british merchant ships this resolution created the continental navy and is considered the first establishment of the us Navy.20 the continental navy achieved mixed results it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many british merchant vessels but it lost twenty-four of its vessels21 and at one point was reduced to two in active service.22 in august 1785, after the revolutionary war had drawn to a close congress had sold alliance the last ship remaining in the continental navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy.2324  in 1972, the chief of naval operations admiral elmo zumwalt authorized the navy to celebrate its birthday on 13 october to honor the establishment of the continental navy in 1775.2520  from re-establishment to the civil waredit  uss constellation vs linsurgente during the quasi-war  the united states was without a navy for nearly a decade a state of affairs that exposed us maritime merchant ships to a series of attacks by the barbary pirates the sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the us navys first warships in 1797 was the us revenue cutter service the primary predecessor of the us coast guard although the usrcs conducted operations against the pirates their depredations far outstripped its abilities and congress passed the naval act of 1794 that established a permanent standing navy on 27 march 1794.26 the naval act ordered the construction and manning of six frigates and by october 1797,21 the first three were brought into service ussunited states ussconstellation and ussconstitution due to his strong posture on having a strong standing navy during this period john adams is called the father of the american Navy.27 in 179899 the navy was involved in an undeclared quasi-war with France.28 from 1801 to 1805, in the first barbary war the us navy defended us ships from the barbary pirates blockaded the barbary ports and executed attacks against the barbary fleets  the us navy saw substantial action in the war of 1812, where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the royal navy it drove all significant british forces off lake erie and lake champlain and prevented them from becoming british-controlled zones the result was a major defeat for the british invasion of new york state and the defeat of the military threat from the native american allies of the british despite this the us navy was unable to prevent the british from blockading its ports and landing troops.29 after the war the us navy again focused its attention on protecting american shipping assets sending squadrons to the caribbean the mediterranean where it participated in the second barbary war that ended piracy in the region south america africa and the Pacific.21 from 1819 to the outbreak of the civil war the africa squadron operated to suppress the slave trade seizing 36 slave ships although its contribution was smaller than that of the much larger british royal navycitation needed  uss constitution vs hms guerriere during the war of 1812  during the mexicanamerican war the us navy blockaded mexican ports capturing or burning the mexican fleet in the gulf of california and capturing all major cities in baja california peninsula in 18461848 the navy successfully used the pacific squadron under commodore robert stockton and its marines and blue-jackets to facilitate the capture of california with large scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the california battalion the navy conducted the us militarys first large-scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at veracruz mexico when larger guns were needed to bombard veracruz navy volunteers landed large guns and manned them in the successful bombardment and capture of the city this successful landing and capture of veracruz opened the way for the capture of mexico city and the end of the war.29 the us navy established itself as a player in united states foreign policy through the actions of commodore matthew perry in japan which resulted in the convention of kanagawa in 1854.citation needed  naval power played a significant role during the american civil war in which the union had a distinct advantage over the confederacy on the seas.29 a union blockade on all major ports shut down exports and the coastal trade but blockade runners owned and operated by british companies provided a thin lifeline the brown-water navys control of the river systems made internal travel difficult for confederates and easy for the union the war saw ironclad warships in combat for the first time at the battle of hampton roads in 1862, which pitted ussmonitor against CSSVirginia.30 for two decades after the war however the us navys fleet was neglected and became technologically obsoletecitation needed  20th centuryedit  the great white fleet demonstrates us naval power in 1907 it was proof that the us navy had blue-water capability  our ships are our natural bulwarks  woodrow Wilson18  a modernization program beginning in the 1880s when the first steel hulled warships stimulated the american steel industry and new steel navy was born.31 this rapid expansion of the us navy and its easy victory over the spanish navy in 1898 brought a new respect for american technical quality rapid building of at first pre-dreadnoughts then dreadnoughts brought the us in line with the navies of countries such as britain and germany in 1907, most of the navys battleships with several support vessels dubbed the great white fleet were showcased in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world ordered by president theodore roosevelt it was a mission designed to demonstrate the navys capability to extend to the global theater.21 by 1911, the us had begun building the super-dreadnoughts at a pace to eventually become competitive with Britain.32  columbia personification of the united states wearing a warship bearing

german u-boats hesitation by the senior command meant that naval forces were not contributed until late 1917. battleship division nine was dispatched to britain and served as the sixth battle squadron of the british grand fleet its presence allowed the british to decommission some older ships and reuse the crews on smaller vessels destroyers and us naval air force units contributed to the anti-submarine operations the strength of the united states navy grew under an ambitious ship building program associated with the naval act of 1916.citation needed  naval construction especially of battleships was limited by the washington naval conference of 192122. the aircraft carriers USSSaratogaCV-3 and USSLexingtonCV-2 were built on the hulls of partially built battle cruisers that had been canceled by the treaty the new deal used public works administration funds to build warships such as USSYorktownCV-5 and USSEnterpriseCV-6. by 1936, with the completion of USSWaspCV-7, the us navy possessed a carrier fleet of 165,000 tonnes displacement although this figure was nominally recorded as 135,000 tonnes to comply with treaty limitations franklin roosevelt the number two official in the navy department during world war i appreciated the navy and gave it strong support in return senior leaders were eager for innovation and experimented with new technologies such as magnetic torpedoes and developed a strategy called war plan orange for victory in the pacific in a hypothetical war with japan that would eventually become reality.33  world war iiedit  main article united states navy in world war ii  the battleship ussidaho shells okinawa on 1 april 1945  the us navy grew into a formidable force in the years prior to world war ii with battleship production being restarted in 1937, commencing with ussnorth CarolinaBB-55. though ultimately unsuccessful japan attempted to neutralize this strategic threat with the surprise attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941. following american entry into the war the us navy grew tremendously as the united states was faced with a two-front war on the seas it achieved notable acclaim in the pacific theater where it was instrumental to the allies successful hopping campaign.22 the us navy participated in many significant battles including the battle of the coral sea the battle of midway the solomon islands campaign the battle of the philippine sea the battle of leyte gulf and the battle of okinawa by wars end in 1945, the us navy had added hundreds of new ships including 18 aircraft carriers and 8 battleships and had over 70 of the worlds total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1,000 tons or greater.3435 at its peak the us navy was operating 6,768 ships on v-j day in august 1945.36  doctrine had significantly shifted by the end of the war the us navy had followed in the footsteps of the navies of great britain and germany which favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons.37 the development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating utilization by the japanese against the us at pearl harbor however shifted us thinking the pearl harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of us navy battleships this placed much of the burden of retaliating against the japanese on the small number of aircraft carriers.38  cold

the soviet union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts.41 the navy participated in operation enduring freedom operation iraqi freedom and is a major participant in the ongoing war on terror largely in this capacity development continues on new ships and weapons including the gerald r ford-class aircraft carrier and the littoral combat ship because of its size weapons technology and ability to project force far from us shores the current us navy remains a potent asset for the united states moreover it is the principal means through which the us maintains international global order namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nations.42  in 2007, the us navy joined with the us marine corps and us coast guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called a cooperative strategy for 21st century seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war the strategy was presented by the chief of naval operations the commandant of the marine corps and commandant of the coast guard at the international sea power symposium in newport ri on 17 october 2007.43 the strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crisesman-made or naturalcan adversely impact the us economy and quality of life this new strategy charts a course for the navy coast guard and marine corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to prevent negative impacts on the uscitation needed  in 2010, chief of naval operations admiral gary roughead noted that demands on the navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future the us navy must rely even more on international partnerships.44  in its 2013 budget request the navy focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the ssbn replacement.45 by the next year the usn found itself unable to maintain eleven aircraft carriers in the face of the expiration of budget relief offered by the bipartisan budget act of 2013 and cno jonathan greenert said that a ten ship carrier fleet would not be able to sustainably support military requirements.46 the british first sea lord george zambellas said that the usn had switched from to resource-led planning.48  one significant change in us policymaking that is having a major effect on naval planning is the pivot to east asia in response this secretary of the navy ray mabus has stated that 60 percent of the total us fleet will be deployed to the pacific by the year 2020.49 the navys most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan published in 2016, calls for a future fleet of 350 ships in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international environment.47  us navy officers aboard the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln

ticonderoga-class cruiser  cruisers are large surface combat vessels that conduct anti-airanti-missile warfare surface warfare anti-submarine warfare and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the anti-ship missile threat facing the united states navy this led to the development of the ANSPY-1 phased array radar and the standard missile with the aegis combat system coordinating the two ticonderoga-class cruisers were the first to be equipped with aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force protection role later developments of vertical launch systems and the tomahawk missile gave cruisers additional long-range land and sea strike capability making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle operations the ticonderoga class is the only active class of cruiser all cruisers in this class are named after battlescitation

interception operations as in the case of destroyers frigates are named after us navy marine corps and coast guard heroes as of autumn 2015, the us navy has retired its most recent class of frigates and expects that by 2020 the littoral combat ships will assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet the lcs is a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone to shore it was to be a networked agile stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals they have the capabilities of a small assault

it became clear following the attack on pearl harbor the battle of the coral sea and the battle of midway that aircraft carriers and the planes that they carried had replaced the battleship as the greatest weapon on the seas leading navy aircraft in world war ii included the grumman F4F wildcat the grumman F6F hellcat the chance vought F4U corsair the douglas sbd dauntless and the grumman tbf avenger navy aircraft also played a significant role in conflicts during the following cold war years with the F-4 phantom ii and the F-14 tomcat becoming military icons of the era the navys current primary fighter and attack airplanes are the multi-mission FA-18CD hornet and its newer cousin the FA-18EF super hornet the F-35 lightning ii is presently under development and was scheduled to

targets without risk to human pilots land strikes are the domain of the BGM-109 tomahawk which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities for anti-ship strikes the navys dedicated missile is the harpoon missile to defend against enemy missile attack the navy operates a number of systems that are all coordinated by the aegis combat system medium-long range defense is provided by the standard missile 2, which has been deployed since the 1980s. the standard missile doubles as the primary shipboard anti-aircraft weapon and is undergoing
