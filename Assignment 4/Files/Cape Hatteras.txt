strand of islands that arch out into the atlantic ocean away from the us mainland then back toward the mainland creating a series of sheltered islands between the outer banks and the mainland for thousands of years these barrier islands have survived onslaughts of wind and sea long stretches of beach sand dunes marshes and maritime forests create a unique environment where wind and waves shape the topography a large area of the outer banks is part of a national park called the cape hatteras national seashore it is also the nearest landmass on the us mainland to bermuda which is about 563 nautical miles 1,043km to the east-southeast  the treacherous waters off the coast of the outer banks is known as the graveyard of the atlantic over 600 ships wrecked here as victims of shallow shoals storms and war diamond shoals a bank of shifting sand ridges hidden beneath the turbulent sea off cape hatteras has never promised safe passage for ships in the past 400 years the graveyard has claimed many lives but island villagers saved many as early as the 1870s, villagers served in the us life-saving service others staffed lighthouses built to guide mariners few ships wreck today but storms still uncover the ruins of the old wrecks that lie along the beaches of the outer banks  cape hatteras national seashore protects parts of three barrier islands bodie island hatteras island and ocracoke island beach and sound access ramps campgrounds nature trails and lighthouses can be found and explored on all three islands.1  the community of buxton lies on the inland side of the cape

hatteras has a humid subtropical climate cfa with long hot summers and short cool winters most of the area falls into usda plant hardiness zone 9.3 cape hatteras is surrounded by water with pamlico sound to the west and the atlantic ocean to the east the proximity to water moderates conditions throughout the year producing cooler summers and warmer winters than inland areas of north Carolina.4 the cape is the northern limit of tropical fauna.5  during the summer average daily highs are in the 85F range and occasional intense brief thundershowers occur as a result of its proximity to water temperatures above 90F are rare with an average of only 2.3 days annually above 90F one to three years out of each decade will not see any 90F readings the coolest month january has a daily high of 52F with lows normally well above freezing f the average window for freezing temperatures is from december 12 to march 11 a growing season of 275 days between which there is an average of 21 nights

tropical systems tropical storms and tropical depressions that affect the area mostly from august to early octobercitation needed  due to its exposed position cape hatteras is virtually the highest-risk area for hurricanes and tropical storms along the entire us eastern seaboard cape hatteras can experience significant wind andor water damage from tropical systems moving northward or northeastward near or over north carolinas outer banks while other areas wilmington nc or myrtle beach and charleston sc to the south and norfolk va and marylands eastern shore to the north experience much less minimal or no damage the cape hatteras area is infamous for being frequently struck by hurricanes that move up the east coast of the united states the strike of hurricane isabel in 2003 was particularly devastating for the area isabel devastated the entire outer banks and also split hatteras island between the two small towns of frisco and hatteras nc 12, which provides a direct route from nags head to hatteras island was washed out when the hurricane created a new inlet students had to use a ferry to get to school the inlet was filled in with sand by the army corps of engineers which took nearly two months to complete the road electrical and water lines were quickly rebuilt when the inlet was filledcitation needed  climate data for cape hatteras mitchell airport 19812010
