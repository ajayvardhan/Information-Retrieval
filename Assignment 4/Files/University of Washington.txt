preacher daniel bagley saw this as a chance to add to the citys potential and prestige they convinced early founder of seattle member of the territorial legislature arthur a denny on the importance of the school two universities were initially chartered but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in lewis county provided that locally donated land was available when no site emerged denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider seattle as a location in 1858.  in 1861, scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres site in seattle to serve as a new university campus arthur and mary denny donated eight acres while fellow pioneers edward lander and charlie and mary terry donated two acres on dennys knoll in downtown Seattle.7 more specifically this tract was bounded by 4th avenue to the west 6th avenue to the east union street to the north and seneca streets to the south  on november 4, 1861, washington opened as the territorial university of washington the legislature passed articles incorporating the university and establishing its board of regents in 1862. the school initially struggled closing three times in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage washington successfully awarded its first graduate clara antoinette mccarty wilt in 1876, with a bachelors degree in science  19th century relocationedit  by the time washington state entered the union in 1889, both seattle and the university had grown substantially washingtons total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students and the campuss relative isolation in downtown seattle faced encroaching development a special legislative committee headed by uw graduate edmond meany was created to find a new campus to better serve the

board of regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition in exchange washington would take advantage of the campus and its development after the fairs conclusion this arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several buildings prepared in part by john charles olmsted the plan was later incorporated into the overall campus master plan permanently affecting the
