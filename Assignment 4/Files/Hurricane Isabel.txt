named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season isabel formed near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave on september 6 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph on september 11. after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105mph on september 18. it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next day  in north carolina the storm surge from isabel washed out a portion of hatteras island to form what was unofficially known as isabel inlet damage was greatest along the outer banks where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed the worst of the effects of isabel occurred in virginia especially in the hampton roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as richmond and washington dc virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane about 64 of the damage and 68 of the deaths occurred in north carolina and virginia electric service was disrupted in areas of virginia for several days some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage  moderate to severe damage extended up the atlantic coastline and as far inland as west virginia roughly six million people were left without electric service in the eastern united states from the strong winds of isabel rainfall from the storm extended from south carolina to maine and westward to michigan throughout the path of isabel damage totalled about 70095370000000000005.37billion 70096991297033000006.99billion 2016USD.1 16deaths in seven us

external links  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on september 1.2 an area of low pressure associated with the wave moved slowly westward and its convection initially appeared to become better organized.3 on september 3, as it passed to the south of the cape verde islands organization within the system degraded,4 though convection increased the next day.5 the system gradually became better organized and dvorak classifications began early on september 5. based on the development of a closed surface circulation it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression thirteen early on september 6. hours later it intensified into tropical storm Isabel,2 though operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until 13hours after it first developed.6  located within an area of light wind shear and warm waters isabel gradually organized as curved bands developed around a circular area of deep convection near the center.7 it steadily strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest and isabel strengthened to a hurricane on september 7 subsequent to the development of a large yet ragged eye located near the deepest convection.8 the eye overall convective pattern and outflow steadily improved in organization,9 and deep convection quickly surrounded the 40-mile eye.10 isabel intensified on september 8 to reach major hurricane status while located 1,300miles east-northeast of barbuda on september 9, isabel reached a primary peak intensity of 135mph for around 24hours, a minimal Category4 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane Scale.2  the eye of hurricane isabel as seen from the international space station  broader view from the international space station  early on september 10, the eyewall became less defined the convection near the eye became eroded and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted.11 as a result isabel weakened slightly to a Category3 hurricane the hurricane turned more to the west due to the influence of the bermuda-azores High.2 later on september 10, isabel restrengthened to a Category4 hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall.12 the hurricane continued to intensify and isabel reached its peak intensity of 165mph on september 11, a category 5 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane Scale.2 due to an eyewall replacement cycle isabel weakened slightly though it retained Category5 status for 24hours.13 as isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened,14 and early on september 13 isabel weakened to a strong Category4 hurricane a weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west-northwest.2 after completing the replacement cycle the hurricanes large 40mile wide eye became better defined,15 and late on the 13th isabel re-attained Category5 status.2 a noaa hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft flying into the hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of 233mph the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an atlantic hurricane.16 cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter,17 and isabel weakened to a strong Category4 hurricane early on september 14. later that day it re-organized and for the third time it attained Category5 status while located 400miles north of san juan puerto Rico.2  cloud tops around the center warmed again early on september 15, and isabel weakened to a category 4 hurricane.2 later that day the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance as a ridge to its northwest build southeastward it resulted in isabel decelerating as it turned to the north-northwest.18 increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further and isabel weakened to a Category2 hurricane on september 16 while located 645miles southeast of cape hatteras north Carolina.2 convection remained minimal though outflow retained excellent organization,19 and isabel remained a Category2 hurricane for twodays until it made landfall between cape lookout and ocracoke island on september 18, with winds of 105mph it weakened after it made landfall though due to its fast forward motion isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western virginia early on september 19. after passing through west virginia as a tropical storm isabel became extratropical over western pennsylvania near pittsburgh the system crossed lake erie into canada early on september 20, the extratropial remnant of isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the cochrane district of Ontario.2  preparationsedit  hurricane isabel making landfall in north carolina on september 18  two days before isabel made landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch from little river south carolina to chincoteague virginia including the pamlico and albemarle sounds and the lower chesapeake bay the nhc also issued a tropical storm watch south of little river south carolina to the mouth of the santee river as well as from chincoteague virginia northward to little egg inlet new jersey hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the east coast of the united states by the time isabel made landfall a tropical storm warning existed from chincoteague virginia to fire island new york and from cape fear north carolina to the mouth of the santee river in south carolina and a hurricane warning existed from chincoteague virginia to cape fear landfall forecasts were very accurate from three days prior the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles  officials declared mandatory evacuations for 24counties in north carolina virginia and maryland though in general not many left according to a survey conducted by the united states department of commerce evacuation rates were estimated as follows 45 in the outer banks 23 in the area around the pamlico sound 23 in virginia and about 15 in Maryland.20 the threat of isabel resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents primarily in north carolina and virginia and included more than 12,000residents staying in emergency shelters.21  19 major airports along the east coast of the united states were closed with more than 1,500flights canceled the washington metro and metrobus system closed prior to the arrival of the storm and amtrak canceled nearly all trains south of the nations capital schools and businesses throughout its path closed prior to isabels arrival to allow time to prepare hardware and home improvement stores reported brisk business of plywood flashlights batteries and portable generators as residents prepared for the storms potential impact the federal government was closed excluding emergency staff members.21 the united states navy ordered the removal of 40ships and submarines and dozens of aircraft from naval sites near norfolk Virginia.22  a contingency plan was established at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery that should the winds exceed 120MPH, the guards could take positions in the trophy room the tomb plaza and providing continual sight of the tomb but the plan was never implemented however it spawned an urban legend that the third infantry sent orders to seek shelter orders that were deliberately disobeyed.23  on september 18, the canadian hurricane centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for portions of southern ontario a gale warning was also issued for lake ontario eastern lake erie the saint lawrence river and georgian Bay.242526 a news report on september 14 warned conditions could be similar to the disaster caused by hurricane hazel 49years prior resulting in widespread media coverage on the hurricane.27 researchers on a convair 580 flight studied the structure of isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm after two similar studies for hurricane michael in 2000 and tropical storm karen in 2001. while flying in a thunderstorm ice build forced the plane to descend.28  impactedit  deaths and damage by region  region  deaths  damage  usd  direct  indirect  florida

northeast north carolina areas were without electricity for almost a month coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge with areas in eastern north carolina and southeast virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge throughout its path isabel resulted in in damage 2017USD and 51deaths, of which 16 were directly related to the storms effects.29  the governors of pennsylvania west virginia maryland new jersey and delaware declared states of emergency.21 isabel was the first major hurricane to threaten the mid-atlantic states and the upper south since hurricane floyd in september 1999. isabels greatest effect was due to flood damage the worst in some areas of virginia since 1972s hurricane agnes more than 60million people were affected to some degreea similar number to floyd but more than any other hurricane in recent memory.30  caribbean and southeast united statesedit  rainfall totals from hurricane isabel  powerful surf affected the northern coastlines of the islands in the greater antilles strong swells also lashed the bahamas during most hurricanes the location of the bahamas prevents powerful swells of atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast florida however the combination of the location forward speed and strength of isabel produced strong swells through the providence channel onto a narrow 10mile stretch of the southeastern florida coastline wave heights peaked at 14feet at delray Beach.16 the swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twopassengers at boynton beach and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near juno beach minor beach erosion was reported in palm beach County.31 in the northern portion of the state waves reached up to 15feet in height at flagler beach causing the flagler beach pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves.32 rip currents from isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in nassau county with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents.33 the beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf.34  in northeastern south carolina the outer rainbands produced moderate winds reaching 45mph at myrtle beach rainfall was

james river basin.40 the strong storm surge surpassed the floodgate to the midtown tunnel while workers attempted to close the gate about 44million us gallons of water flooded the tunnel entirely in just 40minutes, with the workers barely able to escape.41 the damage to the electrical grid and flooding kept old dominion university norfolk state university virginia commonwealth university and many

dc and effects of hurricane isabel in delaware  about 1.24million people lost power throughout maryland and washington dc the worst of isabels effects came from its storm surge which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion in eastern maryland hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the storm surge and related tidal flooding the most severe flooding occurred in the southern portions of dorchester and somerset counties and on kent island in queen annes county thousands of houses were affected in central maryland with severe storm surge flooding reported in

at 1.55inches at mount clemens additionally doppler weather radar estimated rainfall approached 2.5inches in st clair county no damage was reported from isabel in the region.66  swells from isabel produced moderate surf along the atlantic coast of nova scotia particularly in the gulf of Maine.24 isabel also produced rough surf in lake ontario with waves reaching 4m along the western portion at hamilton the waves surpassed seawalls and produced spray onto coastal streets.28 rainfall peaked at 59mm which caused minor flooding and led to one traffic fatality about 27,000people lost power mostly near Toronto.67 the strong pressure gradient between isabel and a high pressure system over eastern canada produced strong easterly winds across lakes ontario and Erie.28 a buoy in lake ontario reported a peak gust of 78kmh and gusts reached as strong as 81kmh at port colborne Ontario.2  aftermathedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  damage to the barrier islands after

entire state of maryland all three counties in delaware and six west virginia counties the disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel.20 by about four months after the passage of the hurricane disaster aid totaled about 2017USD, primarily in north carolina and virginia over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance with about 2017USD approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs about 50,000business owners applied for small business administration loans with about 2017USD approved for the assistance loans about 40,000people visited local disaster recovery centers designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.6970717273  in north carolina hundreds of residents were stranded in hatteras following the formation of isabel Inlet.74 people who were not residents were not allowed to be on the outer banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions when visitors were allowed to return many ventured to see the new inlet despite a 1-mile walk from the nearest road.37 initially long term solutions to the isabel inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet coastal geologists were opposed to the solution stating the evolution of the outer banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes.75 dredging operations began on october 17, about a month after the hurricane struck the united states geological survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of hatteras island a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane.76 on november 22, about two months after the hurricane struck north carolina highway 12 and hatteras island were reopened to public access on the same day the ferry between hatteras and ocracoke was reopened.37  in west virginia the power outages were restored within a week.77 power workers throughout canada assisted the severely affected power companies from maryland to north Carolina.78 hydro-qubec sent 25teams to the new york city area to assist in power outages.79  retirementedit  because of widespread property damage and extensive death tolls the name isabel was retired after the 2003 season and will not be used for future atlantic hurricanes it was replaced by ida for the naming list for the 2009 season.80 the names ina and ivy were also suggested as possible replacement names.81  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  1933 chesapeakepotomac hurricane  annular hurricane  hurricane fran  hurricane hazel  hurricane hugo  hurricane irene  hurricane
