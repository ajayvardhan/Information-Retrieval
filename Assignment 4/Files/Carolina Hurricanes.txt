association awarded a franchise to begin play in boston massachusetts for the first two years of their existence the club played their home games at the boston arena and boston garden with the increasing difficulty of scheduling games at boston garden by the nhl rival boston bruins the owners decided to move the team to hartford connecticut beginning with the 197475 season while waiting for the completion of a new arena in hartford the whalers played the first part of the season at the big e coliseum in west springfield massachusetts on january 11, 1975, the team played its first game in front of a sellout crowd at the hartford civic center coliseum and would maintain its home there through 1997.  as one of the most stable wha teams the whalers along with the edmonton oilers quebec nordiques and winnipeg jets were admitted to the nhl when the rival leagues merged in 1979. however under pressure from the extant nhl team in the new england area the boston bruins the whalers were compelled to rename the team the hartford whalers the whalers were never as successful in the nhl as they had been in the wha recording only three winning seasons they peaked in the mid-to-late 1980s, winning their only playoff series in 1986 over the nordiques before bowing out in the second round to the montreal canadiens taking the habs to overtime of game 7 in the process the next year the club secured the regular-season adams division title only to fall to the nordiques in six games in the first round of the playoffs in 1992, the whalers made the playoffs for the final time but were bounced in the first round in seven games by the canadiens  the organization retains many whaler connections among its off-ice personnel in addition to many members of executive management and the coaching staff broadcasters chuck kaiton john forslund and tripp tracy the time a minor-league player and equipment managers wally tatomir skip cunningham and bob gorman all made the move to north carolina with the team finally the old goal horn from the hartford civic center remains in use at pnc arena  move to north carolina  the whalers were plagued for most of their existence by limited marketability hartford was the smallest american market in the league and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for new york city and boston teams it did not help matters that the hartford civic center was one of the smallest arenas in the league seating just over 15,000 people for hockey the whalers off-ice problems were magnified when the start of the 1990s triggered a spike in player salaries  in may 1997, franchise owner peter karmanos jr announced that the team would move to north carolina  despite assurances made when he purchased the team in 1994 that the whalers would remain in hartford at least through 1998, in march 1997, owner peter karmanos announced that the team would move elsewhere after the 199697 season because of the teams inability to negotiate a satisfactory construction and lease package for a new arena in hartford on may 6, 1997, karmanos announced that the whalers would move to the research triangle area of north carolina and the new entertainment and sports arena in raleigh due to the relatively short time frame for the move karmanos himself thought of and decided upon the new name for the club the carolina hurricanes rather than holding a contest as is sometimes done later that summer the team dropped the whalers colors of blue green and silver for a new black-and-red scheme matching the colors of the north carolina state university wolfpack with whose mens basketball team they would share the arena in raleigh the hurricanes inherited the whalers place in the northeast division  unfortunately for the team the esa would not be complete for two more years the only arena in the triangle area with an ice plant was 45-year-old dorton arena at 5,100 seats it was completely inadequate even for temporary use the hurricanes were thus forced to play home games in greensboro 90 minutes west of raleigh for their first two seasons after the move however the team would be based in raleigh and practice in nearby hillsborougheffectively saddling the hurricanes with 82 road games for the next two years this choice was disastrous for the franchises attendance and reputation with a capacity of over 21,000 people for hockey the greensboro coliseum was the highest-capacity arena in the nhl however triangle-area fans balked at making the 80-mile drive down I-40 to greensboro likewise fans from the piedmont triad mostly refused to support a lame-duck team that had displaced the popular greensborocarolina monarchs minor-league franchise as a result while the opening game drew a sellout is still the largest home crowd in franchise history most games in greensboro attracted crowds of 10,000 or fewer the crowds looked even smaller than that in the cavernous environment furthermore only 29 out of 82 games were televised and cable combined and radio play-by-play coverage on wptf was often pre-empted by wolfpack basketball whose broadcasts wptf was the flagship station leaving these games totally unavailable to those who did not have a ticket with by far the smallest season-ticket base in the nhl and attendance figures routinely well below the league average sports illustrated ran a story titled Disaster,4 and espn anchors mocked the acres of empty seats in a 2006 interview karmanos admitted that it turns out was probably a mistake.5 under the circumstances the hurricanes managed to stay competitive but still finished last in the northeast division with 74 points nine points out of the playoffs  for 199899, the hurricanes curtained off most of the upper deck lowering the coliseums listed capacity to about 12,000. attendance continued to lag most games attracted crowds of well under 10,000. on the ice however the were now out of the doldrums led by the return of longtime whalers captain ron francis keith primeaus 30 goals and gary roberts 178 penalty minutes they tallied their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1992. they also won the new southeast division by eight points only their second division title as an nhl team the 1987 adams division title as the whalers however tragedy struck hours after the teams first-round loss to the bruins when defenceman steve chiasson was thrown from his pickup truck and killed in a single-vehicle drunk-driving accident  despite their move to the brand-new esa the hurricanes played lackluster hockey in 19992000, failing to make the playoffs in 200001, however they claimed the eighth seed nosing out the boston bruins and landed a first-round match-up with the defending champions the new jersey devils although the devils eliminated the hurricanes in six games the series is seen as the real of hockey in the triangle down 30 in the series the hurricanes extended it to a sixth game thereby becoming only the tenth team in nhl history to do so game 6 in raleigh featured their best playoff crowd that year as well as their loudest.6 despite the 51 loss carolina was given a standing ovation by their home crowd as the game ended erasing some of the doubts that the city would not warm up to the team.7  stanley cup finals and slow starts  the hurricanes made national waves for the first time in the 2002 playoffs they survived a late charge from the washington capitals to win the division but expectations were low entering the first round against the defending eastern conference champion new jersey devils however artrs irbe and kevin weekes were solid in goal and the hurricanes won two games in overtime as they defeated the devils in six games their second-round matchup was against the montreal canadiens who were riding a wave of emotion after their captain saku koivus return from cancer treatment in the third period of game 4 in montreal down 21 in the series and 30 in the game carolina would tie the game and then win on niclas wallins overtime goal the game became known to hurricanes fans as the at molson carolina won the next two games by a combined 133 margin over a dejected habs club to take the series  in the eastern conference finals carolina met the heavily-favored toronto maple leafs in game 6 in toronto the leafs mats sundin tied the game with 22 seconds remaining to send it to overtime where carolinas martin gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first stanley cup finals appearance during this series several hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey-wide media attention for the first time fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip and echoed football-season habits honed for games across the parking lot by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game a relative novelty in the cold-weather-centric nhl inside the building the cbcs don cherry lauded the rbc center as loudest building in the nhl praise that would be echoed in 2006.8  in the stanley cup finals carolina would face the detroit red wings thought to be the prohibitive favorite all year though the stunned the wings in game 1, when ron francis scored in the first minute of overtime detroit stormed back to win the next four games game 3 in raleigh featured a triple-overtime thriller eventually won by detroits igor larionov the oldest player to score a last-round goal  eric staal was drafted by the hurricanes in the 2003 nhl entry draft he was later named team captain in 2010.  the hurricanes looked poised to pick up where they left off in 200203, but never recovered from a 10-loss january and finished dead last in the league with 61 points after a similarly slow start to the 200304 season paul maurice who had been the teams coach since midway through their next-to-last season in hartford was fired and replaced with former new york islanders bench boss peter laviolette under laviolette weekes remained tough but the offense was suspect center josef vasicek led the team with a mere 19 goals and 26 assists for 45 points many of the new fans attracted to the team to hockey itself during the 2002 playoff run lost interest and attendance declined one of the few positive results of these losing years however was the teams drafting of future star eric staal in 2003.  stanley cup championsedit  the outcome of the 200405 nhl lockout led to the shrinking of the payroll to the hurricanes however turned out to be one of the nhls biggest surprises turning in the best season in the franchises 34-year history they finished the regular season with a 52228 record and 112 points shattering the previous franchise records of 94 points the wha set by the 197273 whalers and 93 points the nhl set in 198687. it was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the 50-win and 100-point plateaus the 112-point figure was good for fourth overall in the league easily their highest overall finish as an nhl team with the third-overall dallas stars in points but with one fewer win than the stars and second in the east point behind the ottawa senators the hurricanes also ran away with their third southeast division title finishing 20 points ahead of the tampa bay lightning attendance increased from 200304, averaging just under 15,600 per game and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from Hartford.9  in the playoffs after losing the first two games of the conference quarterfinal series against the montreal canadiens laviolette lifted goalkeeper martin gerber who had been struggling to regain his form after playing through a bout of intestinal flu in favor of rookie cam ward the hurricanes went on to win both games in montreal tying up the playoff series and turning the momentum around winning the series on a game 6 overtime goal by cory stillman carolina then faced the new jersey devils in the conference semi-finals which proved surprisingly one-sided as the hurricanes beat the devils in five games stillman struck again once again scoring the series-winning goal  in the eastern conference finals the hurricanes faced the buffalo sabres who had finished just one spot behind the hurricanes in the overall standings the contentious series saw both coaches lindy ruff and laviolette taking public verbal shots at each others team but in the deciding game 7, the hurricanes rallied with three goals in the third to win by a score of 42. rod brindamour scored the game winner as the hurricanes reached the stanley cup finals for the second time in team history  the hurricanes celebrate following their game seven victory in the 2006 stanley cup finals  the stanley cup finals were against the edmonton oilers the first time in nhl history that two former wha franchises had played against one another in the finals the hurricanes rallied from a 30 deficit in game 1 to win 54 after rod brindamour scored with 30 seconds left in game 2, the hurricanes shelled the oilers 50 to take a two-game lead the oilers won game 3 in edmonton 21, as ryan smyth scored the game-winning goal with 247 left to play carolina rebounded in game 4 with a 21 victory and came home with a chance to win the cup on home ice however game 5 saw the oilers come back with a stunning 43 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by fernando pisani in game 6 in edmonton carolina was soundly defeated 40 the only bright point for the hurricanes was the return of forward erik cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since march in game 7, before the second-largest home crowd in franchise history the hurricanes won 31, sealing the hurricanes first stanley cup championship in franchise history ward was honored with the conn smythe trophy for the playoffs most valuable player becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award several hurricanes raised the cup for the first time in their long nhl careers rod brindamour and bret hedican had both played over 15 years without winning the cup while glen wesley the last remaining hartford whaler on the hurricanes roster had waited 18 seasons  the hurricanes stanley cup championship marked the first professional major league sports title for a team from north carolina as well they were the first nhl team to win the stanley cup despite losing at least nine playoff games in that year the 2011 boston bruins the 2014 los angeles kings and the 2017 pittsburgh penguins are the only other teams to have accomplished the feat  post-championship slump  the hurricanes were unable to follow up their success losing four players to free agency in the offseason and 222-man games to injury during 200607, the team struggled throughout the regular season,10 and once eliminated in the last game the hurricanes finished third in the southeast and 11th overall in the eastern Conference.11 this finish made them the first champions since the 193839 chicago black hawks to have failed to qualify for the playoffs both the seasons before and after their championship season and the third champion overall to not defend its title after both the black hawks and the 1995 new jersey devils in 200708, carolina again missed out as washington capitals stormed back to take the division title on the last day of the season leaving the hurricanes second in the division and ninth overall in the conference and making the only the second club in nhl history to miss the playoffs for two seasons running after a cup triumph  in 2009 the hurricanes acquired jussi jokinen through a trade with the tampa bay lightning  after a slow start to the 200809 season cup-winning coach peter laviolette was fired in early december and replaced by his own predecessor paul maurice

conference with 97 points the second-most points in franchise history  the canes 2009 playoff run featured two tight series with dramatic finishes game 4 of the first round matchup with the new jersey devils saw stanley cup playoff history when jussi jokinen scored with seconds left in regulation to win the game the latest regulation game-winning goal in nhl history then in game 7, the devils took a 32 lead into the final two minutes of the game at the prudential center in newark before the struck with 120 to play tim gleason saved a puck on his knees at the right point passed it to joni pitkanen on the left boards who then hit game 4 hero jussi jokinen at the far post for the tying goal just 48 seconds later chad larose sprang eric staal for a solo down-ice rush to give the canes 43

bruins battled back for two wins in game 7 in boston scott walker scored the game and series winner 1846 into overtime to send carolina to the eastern conference finals against the pittsburgh penguins the penguins though put a decisive end to the string sweeping the series 40 on the way to their own stanley cup championship  as a result of their surprise run very few changes were made in the off-season veterans such as aaron ward andrew alberts and stephane yelle were brought in to help drive the team further but things did not go according to plan the hurricanes experienced a 14-game losing streak spanning october and november and midway through the year the replaced their only post-lockout captain rod brindamour with eric staal despite improved play during the second half of the season they could not overcome the deficit from early on in the season the hurricanes would end up with the seventh overall pick in the 2010 nhl entry draft eventually selecting jeff skinner from the

contended for a playoff slot for the entire season aided by skinners emergence as an offensive phenomenon who as the youngest player in the league would lead all rookies in points raleigh hosted the 2011 nhl all-star game in january and eric staal captained a team he selected a team selected by the detroit red wings nicklas lidstrom that featured skinner youngest all-star in nhl history cam ward
