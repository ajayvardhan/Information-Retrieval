providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc model  the australian broadcasting corporation act 19831 changed the name of the organisation to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983.1 although funded and owned by the government the abc remains editorially independent as ensured through the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983.1  the abc is sometimes informally referred to as originally in imitation of the british broadcasting corporations nickname.5  historyedit  main

following.6 a licensing scheme administered by the postmaster-generals department was soon established allowing certain stations government funding albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content.7  following a 1927 royal commission inquiry into radio licensing issues the government established the national broadcasting service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations it also nationalised the australian broadcasting company which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations.7 on 1 july 1932, the australian broadcasting commission was established taking over the operations of the national broadcasting service and eventually establishing offices in each of australias capital cities.78  the abcs perth headquarters in 1937  over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy.9 the australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the abc and the commercial sector.9  news broadcasts were initially restricted due to pressure from sir keith murdoch who controlled many australian newspapers however journalists such as frank dixon and john hinde began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s. in 1939, warren denning was appointed to canberra as the first abc political correspondent after murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by joseph Lyons.10  in 1942 the australian broadcasting act was passed giving the abc the power to decide when and in what circumstances political speeches should be broadcast.11 directions from the minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the commissions annual Report.11 it was used only once in 1963.11 in the same year of the air began on abc radio in perth and was later broadcast nationally  cater argues that reform was urgently needed in 1945  by the end of world war ii the abc was a decadent hollow institution its authority had been compromised by a poorly drafted charter and further undermined by timid management poor governance and creeping wartime censorship in april 1945, boyer refused to accept the post of chairman until prime minister curtin issued a mandate of independence which boyer drafted itself the abc under boyer and general manager charles moses invested as best it could in the cultural capital of the nation establishing viable symphony orchestras and seizing on the

distributed nationally by landline television relay facilities were not in place until the early 1960s.14 this meant that news bulletins had to be sent to each capital city by teleprinter to be prepared and presented separately in each city with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state.14 other television programs at the time included the popular six oclock rock hosted by johnny okeefe mr squiggle as well as operas and plays.14  in 1973 new south wales rugby league boss kevin humphreys negotiated rugby leagues first television deal with the ABC.15 in 1975, colour television was introduced into australia and within a decade the abc had moved into satellite broadcasting greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally in the same year the abc

continued until 1985. in 1978 the abc nsw staff association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference sydney abc was off air for four days.17 a packed free concert in support was held at the regent theatre and compered by bob hudson it featured fred dagg and robyn Archer.18 in 1991, tom molomby wrote  effects of the budget reductions had been so badly handled that the organisation was to remain seriously crippled for years.19  1980s90sedit  the australian broadcasting corporation act 19831 changed the name of the organisation from the broadcasting commission to the broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983.1 at the same time the newly formed corporation underwent significant restructuring the abc was split into separate television and radio divisions with

symphony orchestras which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs.20 open-air free concerts and tours educational activities and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras audience reach.20  abc radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 radio one became the metropolitan network while radio 2 became

period of up to five years but is eligible for renewal.43 the authority and guidelines for the appointment of directors is provided for in the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983.14445  appointments to the abc board made by successive governments have often resulted in criticism of the appointees political affiliation background and relative merit.4647 past appointments have

the australian labor party at the 1972 election,26 as well as sir henry bland david hill was close to neville wran while donald mcdonald was considered to be a close friend of john howard  from 2003

from the federal government licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the whitlam labor government on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.26  the term your 8 cents a day goes coined in the late 1980s during funding

diversity of perspectives so that over time no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented the broadcaster is expected to take no editorial stance other than a commitment to fundamental democratic principles  abc editorial policy  criticismsedit  as a publicly funded broadcaster the abc is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertaken  reviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released.7576 a 2004 roy morgan media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded abc radio as the most accurate news source in the country.77 in mid 2013 the university of the sunshine coast released a study of the professional views of journalists slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either labor or the greens whereas just under a third planned to vote coalition in contrast over 40 of abc journalists would vote for the greens and almost a third Labor.7879  dr rhonda jollys 2014 abc overview noted that commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates abc news and programming and cited a 2005 piece by paul gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the middle-class values of the australian secular left and said that the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions it had always adopted a the left perspective jolly also noted however that supporters of the abc claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased and that from opposition politicians have praised the abc for its scrutiny of government the paper noted that in december 2013, abc chairman james spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs.80 in response to one set of criticisms journalist annabel crabb who has worked at the abc commented single day i see that organisation give voices to australians who otherwise wouldnt be heard on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resources.81  1960s and 1970sedit  the conservative liberal party governments in the 1960s and 1970s attemptedaccording to whom to influence the abcs political coverage by threatening to reduce funding for its news and current affairs

the howard government years abc tvs masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists lateline host maxine mckew ran for labor against liberal prime minister john howard in the 2007 election  for much of the howard government years abc tvs masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists kerry obrien barrie cassidy and maxine mckew 7.30 report and insiders were hosted by former labor staffers kerry obrien and barrie cassidy respectively while the 2007 election saw lateline host mckew defeat liberal prime minister john howard as the labor candidate for the seat of bennelong at that same election liberal front bencher joe hockey was challenged unsuccessfully by abc sydney news weatherman turned labor candidate mike bailey in the seat of north Sydney.85  of the 1996 prime ministerial election debates between opposition leader john howard and labor prime minister paul keating howard later wrote flatly refused to have kerry obrien of the abc the debates because of the way he had handled the second keating-hewson debate in 1993 in which obrien in to bat for Keating.86 howard went on to win that election a decade later the abc media watch program reported that nsw liberal senator concetta fierravanti-wells had written to her constituents to say that the abc had collective loathing of john Howard.87 at the end of the howard governments term in 2007, left-wing political commentator robert manne wrote in the monthly that the howard government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by ideologues who had pushed the agenda of the left on issues like refugees the republic multiculturalism reconciliation radical feminism extreme environmentalism anti-americanism gay rights and so on.2  soon after coming to office in 1996, the howard government reduced the abcs operating grants by 10.88 its appointment of jonathan shier to the position of managing director was controversial for his program of budget cuts restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows.8990 shier left the position early on 31 october 2001.91 7.30 report anchor kerry obrien opposed howards budget cuts to the abc and describes the appointment of shier as its managing director as a manifestation of the obsession with the abc as a kind of biased left-wing culture.92  in howards last election he was defeated in the seat of bennelong by labor candidate maxine mckew who had hosted lateline during the howard era.93 peter mares reported for radio national that wags described it as an promotion while others said shed simply moved from the wing to the wing of the alp mares consulted abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla pru goward who said i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there while mckew said there was no left wing bias though i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophy.94  rudd-gillard-rudd government  abc tvs masthead political programs continued to have strong labor party connections through the period in october 2010, the abc announced that former labor staffer kerry obrien would host four corners beginning in 2011.9596 former labor staffer barrie cassidy continued to host the insiders program in december 2010, chris uhlmann husband of labor mp gai brodtmann was appointed as co-host of the 7.30 current affairs program.97 in 2012, sydney abc news anchor juanita phillips began a relationship with labors minister for climate change greg Combet.9899100101  conservative commentators such as andrew Bolt,102 tim blair and gerard Henderson102 accused the abc of a left-wing bias  abbott-turnbull government  liberal prime minister tony abbott perceived the abc to be left wing and hostile to his government while his successor malcolm turnbull enjoyed better relations with the national broadcaster when the abc co-operated with the guardian to publish stolen documents purporting to reveal monitoring of indonesian officials by australian spy agencies under the rudd government abbott told 2GB radio lot of people feel at the moment that the abc instinctively takes everyones side but Australias.103104105 abbott reportedly called the qa program a lynch Mob.106 when it invited a man convicted of threatening commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in june 2015, abbott asked the makers of the program side are you on.107108 the abc found that there had been an of judgement but repeated the program later in the week prompting abbott to say that should roll over the affair.109 abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the qa program following the affair.110  the broadcaster was critical of abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the abc and required 4.6 cuts over five years as part of his repair program.111112 in early 2015, an internal abc review of its coverage of joe hockeys first budget criticised the post-budget interviews by 730 and lateline finding that the interviewers had given the impression of bias.113  when abbott lost the leadership to turnbull in the september 2015 liberal leadership spill the hosts of the abcs political programs spoke in favour of abbotts demise kerry obrien and barrie cassidy hosts respectively of the abcs flagship weekly current affairs programs four corners and insiders welcomed the replacement of abbott by Turnbull,114115 as did abc radio commentators fran Kelly116 paul Bongiorno117 and amanda Vanstone.118 fairfax and news limited reported that leigh sales the host of 7.30 gave turnbull an unusually warm first interview following his toppling of Abbott.119120  in a march 2016 interview with abc managing director mark scott media watch host paul barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the abc scott noted that while perhaps the abc was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices he did not accept the criticism of bias because lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the abc we dont do that kind of journalism we dont ask questions about our journalists voting pattern and where their ideology are we look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards...121 following the interview conservative abc critic andrew bolt wrote can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the abcs unlawful and dangerous leftist bias while former media watch host jonathan holmes wrote for the age that this interview indicated that abc management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.122  over the period abc tv and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage upon which the wider australian community and political parties were divided when the turnbull government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue advocacy for change continued prompting a call for restraint from the abcs editorial policy manager mark Maley.123  an interview by abc presenter joe obrien with lyle shelton was the subject of a complaint by the australian christian lobby bringing up ian thorpes swimming achievements obrien asked shelton right do you have to participate in that joy and take national pride in those achievements if you now deny him the right to feel like an equal and experience the joy of marriage124 in rejecting any perceived bias the abc said was a advocate question and not inconsistent with standards.125  abc journalists in politicsedit  a number of former journalists and presenters have moved from positions at the abc to politics  state labor premiers and chief
