original tokyo meteorological observatory tky kish-dai was formed within the survey division of geography bureau of home ministry naimu-sh chiri-ry Rychi-ka.15  january 1, 1887 the tokyo meteorological observatory was renamed as the central meteorological observatory ch kish-dai with the transfer of its jurisdiction to the home ministry  april 1895 the ministry of education monbush replaced the preceding ministry as an administrator of the observatory  january 1, 1923 the main office moved to motoe-machi kjimachi-ku takehira-ch 1, where it is near a moat surrounding the imperial Palace.6  november 1943 the ministry of transport and communications unyu tshin-sh took over the cmos operation  may 1945 it became part of the ministry of transport unyu-sh  july 1, 1956 the central meteorological observatory became an agency of the ministry of transport and has been renamed to the japan meteorological agency kish-ch  march 1964 the headquarters office was relocated to the present building in temachi chiyoda-ku  january 6, 2001 the jma becomes an agency of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism kokudo-kts-sh with the japanese government reformation  2013 it has been announced that it would be scheduled to move the headquarters into toranomon Minato-ku.6  servicesedit  overviewedit  the jma is responsible not only for gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts in japan but also for observation and warning of earthquakes tsunamis typhoons and volcanic eruptions.7  the agency has six regional administrative offices five dmos and okinawa meteorological observatory four marine observatories five auxiliary facilities four aviation weather service centers and 47 local offices composed of the lmos these are also used to gather data supplemented by weather satellites such as himawari and other research institutes.7  in 1968, the world meteorological organization designated the jma as a regional specialized meteorological centre for Asia.8 in June1988, the wmo also assigned the jma as a rsmc for the northwestern pacific under its tropical cyclone programme.8 in July1989, the rsmc tokyo typhoon center was established within the headquarters office which dealt with the forecasting and dissemination of active tropical cyclones as well as preparing a summary of each years cyclone activity.9  observation and forecastedit  this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it 2012  weatheredit  land weatheredit  each dmo and lmo issues weather forecasts and warnings or advisories to the general public live in its own area weather data used to these forecasts are acquired from the surface observation by the amedas the radar observation the upper-air observation and the satellite observation mainly using the himawari series  marine weatheredit  see also marine weather forecasting  the marine observatories are seated in hakodate maizuru kobe and nagasaki these stations observe ocean waves tide levels sea surface temperature and ocean current etc in the northwestern pacific basin as well as the sea of japan and the sea of okhotsk basin and provide marine meteorological forecasts resulted from them in cooperation with the hydrographic and oceanographic department japan coast guard  aviation weatheredit  see also metar and sigmet  in 2005, in accordance with the icaos new cnsatm system the civil aviation bureau of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism set up the air traffic management center in fukuoka where the fir is fixed along with this establishment jma placed the air traffic meteorology center inside the atmc  the agency forecasts sigmet for aircraft in flight within the fukuoka fir airspace while volmet is broadcast by each aviation weather service centers at the airports of haneda narita centrair and kansai additionally aviation weather stations the airports of new chitose sendai osaka fukuoka kagoshima and naha deal with the similar tasks as these  tropical cyclonesedit  see also typhoon and 2017 pacific typhoon season  in the northwestern pacific area the typhoon season ordinarily comes almost from may to november the jma forecasts and warns or advises on tropical cyclones to the public in japan and its surrounding countries as well because it also works as the rsmc tokyo typhoon Center.10  earthquakesedit  see also japan meteorological agency seismic intensity scale and earthquake early warning  the jma has its own 624 observation stations across the country11 that set up at intervals of 20km approximately12 in order to measure seismic intensity of earthquakes precisely the agency also utilize about 2,900 more seismographs11 owned by the national research institute for earth science and disaster prevention and local governments a 24-hour office has been housed within the jma headquarters in tokyo for monitoring and tracking seismic events in the vicinity of japan to collect and process their data which issues observed earthquakes information on its hypocenter magnitude seismic intensity and possibility of tsunami occurrence after quakes quickly to the public through the earthquake phenomena observation system the earthquake early warning system began to work fully for the general public on october 1, 2007.  the agency is one of the representatives of the national coordinating committee for earthquake Prediction.14  tsunamisedit  see also tsunami warning system  it is essential to provide coastal regions for tsunami information so that its catastrophic damages can be reduced and mitigated there in case of there is a possibility of tsunami after an earthquake jma issues tsunami warning or advisory for each region in japan with information of estimated tsunami heights and arrival times within 2 to 3 minutes of the quake  volcanosedit  see also volcanic ash advisory center  the agency set up four volcanic observations and information centers within dmos in sapporo sendai tokyo and fukuoka they are monitoring volcanic events on 110 active volcanos in japan and 47 of these volcanos selected by the coordinating committee for prediction of volcanic eruption are under the 24-hour observation with seismographs accelerometers gps air-shock recorders fixed point observation cameras and other equipment if it is predicted that a volcanic eruption will affect inhabited areas or are around a crater volcanic warnings are issued and supplemented by volcanic alert levels  organizationedit  headquartersedit  jma headquarters kish-ch honch  director-general
