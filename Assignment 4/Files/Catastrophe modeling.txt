theory in mathematics see catastrophe  catastrophe modeling known as cat modeling is the process of using computer-assisted calculations to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or earthquake cat modeling is especially applicable to analyzing risks in the insurance industry and is at the confluence of actuarial science engineering

catastrophe risk the exposure data can be categorized into three basic groups  information on the site locations referred to as geocoding data address postal code countycresta zone et cetera  information on the physical characteristics of the exposures occupationoccupancy year built number of stories number of employees et cetera  information on the financial terms of the insurance coverage value limit deductible et cetera  outputedit  the output is an estimate of the losses that the model predicts would be associated with a particular event or set of events when running a probabilistic model the output is either a probabilistic loss distribution or a set of events that could be used to create a loss distribution probable maximum losses and average annual losses are calculated from the loss distribution when running a deterministic model losses caused by a specific event are calculated for example hurricane katrina or magnitude 8.0 earthquake in downtown san francisco could be analyzed against the portfolio of exposures  usesedit  insurers and risk managers use cat modeling to assess the risk in a portfolio of exposures this might help guide an insurers underwriting strategy or help them decide how much reinsurance to purchase  some state departments of insurance allow insurers to use cat modeling in their rate filings to help determine how much premium their policyholders are charged in catastrophe-prone areas  insurance rating agencies such as a m best and standard poors use cat modeling to assess the financial strength of insurers that take on catastrophe risk  reinsurers and reinsurance brokers use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of reinsurance treaties  european insurers use cat models to derive the required regulatory capital under the solvency ii regime cat models are used to derive catastrophe loss probability distributions which are components of many solvency ii internal capital models  likewise cat bond investors investment banks and bond rating agencies use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of catastrophe bond  open catastrophe modelingedit  recently an effort to create and disseminate open multi-hazard cat risk modeling tools was initiated by the alliance for global open risk analysis  also oasis loss modelling framework httpwwwoasislmforg has been created it has been founded as a not for profit organisation funded and owned by the insurance industry to promote open access to models and to promote transparency open source code to be available  operating on the oasis lmf modex the cat risk modelling platform has been brought to market by simplitium to provide the industry with a deeper understanding of risk the modex platform allows model providers from all over the world to make their models available to the industry using the oasis framework by creating a marketplace where model developers can make their models available via a single user interface the platform lowers the barriers to entry in the cat model marketplace and encourages the development of new and improved cat risk models  additionally the insurance industry is currently working with the association for cooperative operations research and development to develop an industry standard for collecting and sharing exposure data to date the industry has been operating on closed proprietary data formats  see alsoedit  hazus  international society of catastrophe managers  referencesedit  see edwards scott the chaos of forced migration a means of modeling complexity for humanitarian ends
