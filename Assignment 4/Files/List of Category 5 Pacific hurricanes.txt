list of category 5 pacific hurricanes  tracks of all Category5 pacific hurricanes east of the international dateline  Category5 hurricanes are tropical cyclones that reach Category5 intensity on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale they are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet earth they are rare in the eastern pacific ocean and generally form only once every several years in general Category5s form in clusters in single years landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere  the term is used for tropical cyclones in the pacific ocean north of the equator and east of the international date line a Category5 pacific hurricane is therefore a tropical cyclone in the north pacific ocean that reached Category5 intensity east of the international dateline identical phenomena in the north pacific ocean west of the dateline are called or typhoons Category5 super typhoons generally happen several times per season so cyclones of that intensity are not exceptional for that region this difference in terminology therefore excludes storms such as super typhoon paka and super typhoon oliwa of 1997, and super typhoon genevieve of 2014, which formed east of the dateline but did not reach Category5 intensity until after crossing the dateline  contents  1 statistics  2 category 5 pacific hurricanes  3 climatology  4 landfalls  5 see also  6 references  statisticsedit  saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale  td  ts  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  a Category5 hurricane is defined as having sustained windspeeds of at least 137 knots 254kmh over a one-minute period 10 metres above the ground.12 as a tropical cyclone is moving its wind field is asymmetric in the northern hemisphere the strongest winds are on the right side of the storm to the direction of motion the highest winds given in advisories are those from the right side.3  since the 1959 season only 15 hurricanes are known to have reached Category5 intensity there are no known Category5 storms occurring before 1959. it is possible that some earlier storms reached Category5 over open waters but they were never recognized because they never affected land and remained at sea.4  category 5 pacific hurricanesedit  hurricane linda at its peak intensity on September12, 1997.  hurricane patricia shortly after its record peak intensity on October23, 2015.  this lists all of the Category5 hurricanes in the order in which they formed only 1994s hurricane emilia and 2006s hurricane ioke have reached Category5 intensity more than once that is by weakening into a Category4 or weaker storm and later re-strengthening to a Category5 storm  before the advent of reliable geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated.5 it is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed but they were not reported and therefore not recognized however the lack of pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.4  the minimum central pressure of these storms is for the most part estimated from satellite imagery using the dvorak technique in the case of Kenna,6 Ava,7 and patricia the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft flying into the storm.4 because of the estimation of central pressures it is possible that other storms more intense than these have formed.8  the reason for estimating the pressure lieu of direct measurements is the fact that most of these storms did not threaten land.9 as kenna and patricia were threatening land their pressures were measured by hurricane hunters using dropsondes.6 while hurricane ava never threatened land,4 it too was flown into by hurricane hunters to test equipment and conduct research.7  older storms have incomplete pressure readings since there were no satellite-based estimates the only observations were taken by ships land-based observations or reconnaissance aircraft when available avas minimum known pressure was measured when it was a Category4 hurricane for example.4 john and gilma have incomplete pressures because the central pacific hurricane center in general did not publish pressure on systems in the central pacific to the dateline at the time.10 however it should be noted that this list is not identical to the list of most intense pacific hurricanes the most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern pacific was 2014s odile the lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars lower than that of some category 5s, such as Guillermo.4  hurricanes have reached Category5 intensity during every month from june to october the earliest Category5 to form in a season is 1973s hurricane ava which formed on June7. the latest Category5 to form in a season is hurricane kenna which reached peak intensity on october 24. hurricanes ava gilma ioke linda and patricia are the most intense storms to form in their respective months there have been no may november or off-season Category5 hurricanes.4  two pacific hurricanes are known to have reached Category5 intensity multiple times emilia and ioke both did it twice and ioke reached Category5 status a third time as a typhoon while in the western Pacific.4 hurricane ioke was tied for the longest-lasting Category5 hurricane recorded spending 42hours at that strength,11 while hurricanes john and linda had the longest time spent consecutively at that intensity.4  hurricane hernan off the coast of mexico on

as a Category5, emilia was at that intensity for 6hours the second time was for 12 for a total of 18hours.12  for its first time as a Category5, ioke was at that intensity for 18hours the second time was 24 additional hours east of the dateline giving a total of 42hours.4 ioke did not lose Category5 status on august 26, however it moved into the western north pacific and thus was no longer considered a hurricane but rather a typhoon  climatologyedit  hurricane guillermo the first of two Category5s during the 1997 season  in the eastern pacific Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in el nio years during el nio years conditions are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear this is why Category5s cluster in single seasons the effects of el nio are most significant in the central pacific to the dateline.13  the general lack of Category5s in non warm-enso years is because of there being limited space for development the prevailing ocean currents of the area carry warm water to the west as there is no large piece of land to block the water and cause it to up like in the atlantic the area suitable for all tropical cyclones is small farther out to sea while waters are still warm wind shear limits the development of tropical cyclones in the waters south of hawaii this makes an otherwise ideal region unfavorable for tropical cyclones  this does not mean that a Category5 hurricane cannot form outside of an el nio event the entire year of 1959 was neither an el nio or a la nia but it had one Category5 hurricane most of 1973 was during a la nia which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern pacific yet hurricane ava a category 5 hurricane formed in june of that year.14 the 2009, 2010, 2014, and 2015 seasons are the only pairs of seasons in which a category 5 hurricane formed in consecutive years and celia and marie and patricia respectively.15  landfallsedit  hurricane kenna one of only three Category5 pacific hurricanes to make landfall at any intensity  of all of the Category5 pacific hurricanes the only ones to make landfall at any intensity were hurricane kenna hurricane rick and hurricane patricia none made landfall as Category5 hurricanes patricia and kenna had weakened to Category4 at the time of their landfalls and rick was a tropical storm at its landfall patricia was the strongest landfall among pacific hurricanes 1976s hurricane madeline and 1992s hurricane iniki are tied as the second strongest storms at landfall both of which didnt reach Category5 strength but made landfall as stronger category 4 storms than Kenna.6 originally a hurricane in 1959 was thought to have struck manzanillo at Category5 intensity but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a Category4 hurricane and made landfall with the same winds as Kenna.16 patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a Category5 hurricane near manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016.  in addition to these three systems hurricanes john linda and ioke all threatened land for a while john and ioke had minimal impact on johnston atoll and john caused heavy surf in Hawaii.12 linda was briefly forecast to approach southern california and it passed close to socorro island near peak intensity.1117  the reason for the lack of landfalls is that tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west.18 in the atlantic this sends hurricanes towards north america in the eastern pacific this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear hawaii the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern pacific is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  weather portal  book category 5 pacific hurricanes  list of tropical cyclones
