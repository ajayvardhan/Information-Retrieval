plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  hurricane dora was first identified as a broad area of low pressure on August28, 1964, as it moved off the west coast of africa into the atlantic ocean near dakar Senegal.1 traveling west-southwestward,2 the system brushed the cape verde islands the following day by August31, images from the eighth television infrared observation satellite viii depicted a developing storm with a central dense overcast banding features and cirrus outflow observations from ships in the vicinity of the storm indicated decreasing barometric pressures and wind gusts up to 40mph on September1, reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system and determined that it had already become a tropical storm with sustained winds reaching 60mph shortly thereafter the first advisory was issued on tropical storm dora and the center was estimated to be roughly 850mi east of Trinidad.13  upon being classified on September1, dora turned towards the northwest and intensified.2 several reconnaissance missions into the storm indicated that it attained hurricane status during the afternoon of September21 however in the official atlantic hurricane database it is not listed as reaching this intensity until the nighttime hours.2 increasing in size and strength,1 dora attained winds of 100mph early on September3, the equivalent
