cyclone that affected areas of central america in early october 2005. the eighteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season stan formed from a tropical wave on October1 after it had moved into the western caribbean sea the depression slowly intensified and reached tropical storm intensity the following day before subsequently making its first landfall on the yucatn peninsula traversing the peninsula the tropical storm weakened but was able to re-intensify once it entered the bay of campeche under favorable conditions for tropical development stan attained hurricane strength on October4, and later reached peak intensity with winds of 80mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 977mbar 28.85inHg. the hurricane maintained this intensity until landfall near punta roca partida mexico later the same day once over the mountainous terrain of mexico however stan quickly weakened and dissipated on October5.  due to stans position within a large area of convective activity and thunderstorms the hurricanes effects were far-reaching and widespread across central america flash floods generated by the hurricane caused severe crop losses particularly to coffee crops overall stan caused at least 1,668deaths across six countries with many others unaccounted for most of these fatalities occurred in guatemala and were mostly caused by mudslides triggered by torrential rainfall the floods in guatemala destroyed entire towns and disrupted exportation of petroleum in mexico the heavy rains triggered additional mudslides and caused rivers to overflow flooding nearby villages despite being relatively far from stan as opposed to other countries el salvador was also severely affected by the hurricane the santa ana volcano erupted while stan was producing heavy rains in the country which contributed to the damage already wrought by mudslides transportation in the country was disrupted across the region stan caused in damages primarily due to torrential rainfall  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  3.1 mexico  3.2 honduras  3.3 guatemala  3.4 el salvador  4 retirement  5 see also  6 references  7 external links  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  hurricane stan originated from a tropical wave that was first identified by the national hurricane center off the west coast of africa on September17, 2005. traveling westward the wave remained weak barely being notable by September22 convection began to increase however wind shear in the region prevented this development from continuing the system entered the caribbean sea several days later a region with more favorable conditions for cyclonic development intermittent convection formed around the wave as it moved west-northwestward before the development maintained itself.1 on October1, the system had become sufficiently organized for the nhc to classify it as tropical depression Twenty,2 with the center of circulation situated roughly 135mi southeast of cozumel Mexico.1  located to the south of a low to mid-level tropospheric ridge the depression tracked towards the west-northwest within a few hours of being warned upon the system further intensified into tropical storm Stan.1 this followed the development of a strong convective banding feature to the southeast of the storms center.3 around 1000UTC cdt on October2, stan made its first landfall near punta hualaxtoc mexico roughly 35mi south of tulum with winds of 40mph over the following 18hours, the weak storm traversed the southern portion of the yucatn peninsula upon entering the gulf of mexico on October3, stan had weakened to a tropical depression1 however convection began to redevelop over the storms center,4 allowing the system to re-attain tropical storm status.1  tropical rainfall measuring mission estimate of rainfall from hurricane stan september 29 october 5  a strong area of high pressure over the western gulf of mexico forced the storm to turn southwestward back to the mexican coastline.1 increasingly deep cloud cover formed over the storm in response to a favorable environment over the bay of campeche late on October3, forecasters at national hurricane center noted a statistical rapid intensity index indicating a 49 chance of stan undergoing rapid intensification before its final landfall.5 this intensification did take place within 12hours before the hurricane moved onshore overnight the structure of stan rapidly improved with a banding eye-feature developing within unusually deep convection with cloud-top temperatures measured at 90C by infrared satellites.6 following this development national hurricane center upgraded the storm to a Category1 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale around 1200UTC on October4, stan made landfall near punta roca partida with winds of 80mph the storm also attained its lowest barometric pressure of 977mbar 28.85inHgat this time not long after moving over the mountainous terrain of central mexico stan rapidly weakened to a tropical depression and fully dissipated early on October5 over the state of Oaxaca.1  preparationsedit  some 100,000 inhabitants of the sierra de los tuxtlas region on the gulf coast were evacuated from their homes and incidents of mild flooding as well as wind damage as uprooted trees and roofs ripped off houses were reported from coastal areas of veracruz including the port of veracruz boca del ro san andrs tuxtla santiago tuxtla minatitln and coatzacoalcos as well as state capital xalapa further inland the armed forces evacuated the inhabitants of a dozen or so towns on the coastal plain between world heritage site tlacotalpan in the west

torrential rainstorms dropped upwards of 20inches of rain causing severe flash floods mud slides and crop damage to the coffee crop which was close to harvest over portions of mexico and central america including guatemala el salvador nicaragua honduras and costa rica most of the rainstorms were non-tropical in nature and impossible to relate to the hurricane however the impact of the larger weather system can be considered as a whole  hundreds were reported missing and were feared dead throughout the region one estimate put the death toll above 2,000 in guatemala alone the final death toll will likely never be known due to the extensive decomposition of bodies in the mud note that only 80-100 of the deaths were estimated to have been as a result of stan the rest were not caused by stan itself but were the result of the large system of non-tropical rains that had spawned the hurricane.8  most of the reported fatalities were as a result of the flooding and mudslides although eight of the deaths in nicaragua were as a result of a boat carrying migrants from ecuador and peru that ran ashore a large portion of the figure comes from one village alone as a mudslide completely destroyed the village of panabaj in guatemalas solol department  mexicoedit  as a tropical storm stan brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the yucatan peninsula flash flooding took place in several areas however no loss of life was reported.9  hurricane stan making landfall in veracruz  as the system progressed inland towards the sierra madre del sur to the west of the isthmus of tehuantepec the states of oaxaca and chiapas were affected with torrential rains areas of chiapas near the guatemalan border were hit hard particularly the coastal border town of tapachula in tapachula the river overflowed its banks and caused tremendous damage the destruction of all the bridges leading in and out of the town meaning that it was only accessible through the air the state government reported that 33 rivers broke their banks and that an indeterminate number of homes upwards of 20 bridges and other infrastructure were smashed in the storms wake  some areas in the sierra norte in the central state of puebla were also flooded three people died in a mudslide at xochiapulco hill  in addition pemex evacuated 270 employees from its oil platforms in the gulf of mexico although no damage was reported and the plants were restarted  the ministry of the interior declared states of emergency in the worst hit municipalities of five states chiapas hidalgo oaxaca puebla and veracruz according to mexican president vicente fox hurricane stan wrought roughly 20billion pesos usd in damage throughout the country.10  hondurasedit  throughout honduras heavy rains produced by hurricane stan resulted in six fatalities and roughly in losses.7  guatemalaedit  landslides affecting infrastructure crops and water sources in guatemala  by october 11, 2005 at least 1,500 people were confirmed to have died and up to 3,000 were believed missing many communities were overwhelmed and the worst single incident appears to have occurred in panabaj an impoverished maya village in the highlands near lake atitln in solol department this volcanic lake was so overwhelmed by the torrential rains that many of the small mayan villages covering the shores experienced landslides from above some of the towns were so overwhelmed by the slides that the mayor has declared them graveyards and all people who are missing are counted as dead piedra grande a hamlet in the municipality of san pedro sacatepquez was also destroyed floods and mudslides obliterated the community of about 1,400 people and it was feared that most or all of the population of the community lost their lives the government stated that it did not know what was going on in the southwest of the country and particularly in the san marcos department because a vital bridge was destroyed at el palmar quetzaltenango cutting the region off from the rest of the country there were reported petrol shortages including in quetzaltenango  el salvadoredit  the eruption of the santa ana volcano located near the capital san salvador on october 1, 2005 compounded the problems which led to even more destructive floods and mudslides from stan  a state of emergency was declared according to the director of el salvadors national emergency centre 300 communities were affected by the floods with over 54,000 people forced to flee their homes a state of emergency also was called for in guatemala by president scar berger where 36,559 people were reported in emergency shelters some looting was also reported a scene reminiscent of hurricane katrina five weeks previous  a spokesman for the salvadoran red cross said that emergency is bigger than the rescue capacity we have floods everywhere bridges about to collapse landslides and dozens of roads blocked by mudslides the pan-american highway was cut off by mudslides leading into the capital san salvador as well as several other roads 72 deaths were confirmed in el salvador  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  following the severe
