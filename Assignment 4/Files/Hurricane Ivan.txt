the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on september 2, 2004, tropical depression nine formed from a large tropical wave southwest of cape verde as the system moved to the west it strengthened gradually becoming tropical storm ivan on september 3 and reaching hurricane strength on september 5, 1,150 miles to the east of tobago later that day the storm intensified rapidly and by 5pm edt utc ivan became a category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 miles per hour the national hurricane center said that the rapid strengthening of ivan on september 5 was unprecedented at such a low latitude in the atlantic basin.12  the eye of hurricane ivan as seen from the international space station on september 11, 2004.  as it moved east ivan weakened slightly because of wind shear in the area.3 the storm passed over grenada on september 7, battering several of the windward islands as it entered the caribbean sea ivan reintensified rapidly and became a Category5 hurricane just north of the windward netherlands antilles and bonaire and aruba on september 9 with winds reaching 160mph ivan weakened slightly as it moved west-northwest towards jamaica as ivan approached the island late on september 10, it began a westward jog that kept the eye and the strongest winds to the south and west however because of its proximity to the jamaican coast the island was battered with hurricane-force winds for hours.1  after passing cuba ivan resumed a more northerly track and regained Category5 strength ivans strength continued to fluctuate as it moved west on september 11, and the storm attained its highest winds of 163mph as it passed within 30 miles of grand cayman ivan reached its peak strength with a minimum central pressure of 910 millibars on september 12. ivan passed through the yucatn channel late on september 13 while its eyewall affected the westernmost tip of cuba once over the gulf of mexico it weakened slightly to Category4 strength which it maintained while approaching the gulf coast of the united States.1  hurricane ivan at landfall in baldwin county alabama on the us gulf coast  just before it made landfall in the united states ivans eyewall weakened considerably and its southwestern portion almost disappearedcitation needed around 2am cdt september 16 utc ivan made landfall on the us mainland in gulf shores alabama as a Category3 hurricane with 120mph winds some hurricane information sources put the winds from hurricane ivan near 130mph upon landfall in alabama and northwestern Florida.45 ivan then continued inland maintaining hurricane strength until it was over central alabama ivan weakened rapidly that evening and became a tropical depression the same day still over alabama ivan lost tropical characteristics on september 18 while crossing virginia later that day the remnant low drifted off the us mid-atlantic coast into the atlantic ocean and the low pressure disturbance continued to dump rain on the united States.1  on september 20, ivans remnant surface low completed an anticyclonic loop and moved across the florida peninsula as it continued west across the northern gulf of mexico the system reorganized and again took on tropical characteristics.1 on september 22 the national weather service considerable and sometimes animated in-house discussion the demise of Ivan,6 determined that the low was in fact a result of the remnants of ivan and thus named it accordingly on the evening of september 23, the revived ivan made landfall near cameron louisiana as a tropical depression ivan finally dissipated on september 24 as it moved overland into Texas.1  recordsedit  ivan as a category 3 hurricane east of the windwards on september 5, 2004.  ivan set 18 new records for intensity at low latitudes when ivan first became a category 3 hurricane on september 3 utc it was centered near 10.2degrees north from the equator this is the most southerly location on record for a major hurricane in the atlantic basin.1 just six hours later ivan also became the most southerly Category4 hurricane on record in the atlantic basin when it reached that intensity while located at 10.6degrees north.7 finally at midnight on september 9 while centered at 13.7degrees north ivan became the most southerly Category5 hurricane on record in the atlantic basin.7 the latter record would not be surpassed until hurricane matthew in 2016, which reached Category5 intensity at 13.4degrees north.8 ivan was also tied with the hurricane as the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record attaining a minimum atmospheric pressure of 910 millibars inhg this record was later surpassed by hurricane maria of 2017 which attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 908 millibars inhg  ivan had held the world record of 33 32 consecutive six-hour periods of intensity at or above Category4 strength this record was broken two years later by pacific hurricanetyphoon ioke which had 36 consecutive six-hour periods at Category4 strength this contributed to ivans total accumulated cyclone energy of 70.38.9 the tornado outbreak associated with ivan spawned 120 tornadoes more than any other tropical cyclone worldwide  scientists from the naval research laboratory at stennis space center mississippi have used a computer model to predict that at the height of the storm the maximum wave height within ivans eyewall reached 131 feet  preparationsedit  caribbeanedit  by september 5, a hurricane watch was posted for barbados early on the following day a tropical storm watch was issued for grenada later that

power reported 489,000subscribers had lost electrical powerroughly half of its subscriber base  rainfall in the united states caused by ivan  elsewhere in the united statesedit  further inland ivan caused major flooding bringing the chattahoochee river near atlanta and many other rivers and streams to levels at or near 100-year records the delaware river and its tributaries crested just below their all-time records set by hurricane diane in 1955. locations in southern new hampshire and massachusetts received over 7inches of rainfall from the remnants of ivan causing flooding and mudslides in connecticut high winds moved in quickly and unexpectedly and a boater was killed when his trimaran capsized in 50-knot winds on long island Sound.42  in western north carolina many streams and rivers reached well above flood stage in an area that was heavily flood damaged just a week and a half prior from the remnants of hurricane frances causing many roads to be closed high winds

the system also spawned deadly tornadoes as far north as Maryland45 and destroyed seven oil platforms in the gulf of mexico while at sea while crossing over the mid-atlantic states ivans remnants spawned 117 tornadoes across the eastern united states with the 40tornadoes spawned in virginia on september 17 setting a daily record for the commonwealth.46 ivan then moved into the wheeling west virginia and pittsburgh area causing major flooding and gusty winds pittsburgh international airport recorded the highest 24-hour rainfall for pittsburgh recording 5.95 inches of rain.47 ivans rain caused widespread flooding the juniata river basin was flooded and the frankstown branch crested at its highest level ever.48 after ivan regenerated in the gulf of mexico it caused further heavy rainfall up to 8 inches in areas of louisiana and texas  canadaedit  on the morning of september 21, the remnant mid-level circulation of ivan combined with a frontal system this produced a plume of moisture over the canadian maritimes for four days producing heavy rainfall totaling 6.2 inches in gander newfoundland high winds of up to 89mph downed trees and caused power outages in newfoundland prince edward island and eastern nova scotia the system produced intense waves of up to 50 feet near cape bonavista the system killed two when it grounded a fishing vessel and was indirectly responsible for four traffic fatalities in Newfoundland.49  aftermathedit  grenadaedit  see also effects of hurricane ivan in the lesser antilles and south america grenada  grenada suffered serious economic repercussions following the destruction caused by ivan before ivan the economy of grenada was projected to grow by 4.7, but the islands economy instead contracted by nearly 3 in 2004. the economy was also projected to grow by at least 5 through 2007, but as of 2005update, that estimate had been lowered to less than 1. the government of grenada also admitted that government debt 130 of the islands gdp was in october 2004 and appointed a group of professional debt advisors in january 2005 to help seek a cooperative restructuring agreement with creditors.50  more than US150million was sent to grenada in 2004 to aid reconstruction following ivan but the economic situation remains fragile the international monetary fund reports that as enough as the present fiscal situation is it is unfortunately quite easy to envisage circumstances that would make it even more so furthermore in donor financing and tax revenues or events such as a further rise in global oil prices pose a grave risk.51  jamaicaedit  by two days after ivans passage usaids hurricane recovery program distributed emergency relief supplies for families who were displaced by the storm during phase one of the
