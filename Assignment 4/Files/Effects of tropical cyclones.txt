cause from 19701999  the main effects of tropical cyclones include heavy rain strong wind large storm surges at landfall and tornadoes the destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity its size and its location tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy as well as change the landscape near coastal areas by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast even well inland heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones paths being very hazardous to peoples life  after the cyclone has passed devastation often continues standing water can cause the spread of disease and transportation or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed hampering clean-up and rescue efforts nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones despite their devastating effects tropical cyclones are also beneficial by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward out at sea ships take advantage of their known characteristics by navigating through their weaker western half  when a cyclone hits it causes pst hazards pst is an acronym standing for primary secondary and tertiary a primary hazard involves destructive winds debris and storm surge secondary hazard is flooding fires and of course fresh water flooding finally tertiary hazards involves food prices that go majorly up and other long term

at seaedit  a mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6x1014 watts.1 tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves heavy rain and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks.2 generally after its passage a tropical cyclone stirs up ocean water lowering sea surface temperatures behind it.3 this cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone on rare occasions tropical cyclones may actually do the opposite 2005s hurricane dennis blew warm water behind it contributing to the unprecedented intensity of hurricane emily which followed it closely.4 hurricanes help to maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes and polar regions.5 were it not for the movement of heat poleward other means as well as hurricanes the tropical regions would be unbearably hot  north american colonizationedit  shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones such shipwrecks can change the course of history,6 as well as influence art and literature a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america in 1565.7 the sea venture was wrecked near bermuda in 1609 which led to the colonization of Bermuda8 and provided the inspiration for shakespeares the tempest  shippingedit  the dangerous semicircle is the upper-right corner with the arrow marking the direction of motion of a northern hemisphere storm note that typhoons etc are asymmetrical and semicircle is a convenient misnomer  mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones they split tropical cyclones in two based on their direction of motion and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the northern hemisphere left in the southern hemisphere sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm as the cyclones translation speed and its rotational wind are additive the other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle9 since weather conditions are lessened in this portion of the storm are still potentially quite hazardous the rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path the t those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.1011  upon landfalledit  the most significant effects of a tropical cyclone occur when they cross coastlines making landfall then it destroys ships and lives  strong windsedit  see also tropical cyclone windspeed climatology  strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges personal property and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states major hurricanes comprise just 21 of all land falling tropical cyclones but account for 83 of all damage.12 tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.13 tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a diaspora of the population of the region.14  storm surgeedit  the aftermath of hurricane katrina in gulfport mississippi katrina was the costliest tropical cyclone in united states history  see also storm surge  the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths.14 the relatively quick surge in sea level can move mileskilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales  heavy rainfalledit  see also tropical cyclone rainfall climatology  the thunderstorm activity in a tropical cyclone produces intense rainfall potentially resulting in flooding mudslides and landslides inland areas are particularly vulnerable to freshwater flooding due to residents not preparing adequately.15 heavy inland rainfall eventually flows into coastal estuaries damaging marine life in coastal estuaries.16 the wet environment in the aftermath of a tropical cyclone combined with the destruction of sanitation facilities and a warm tropical climate can induce epidemics of disease which claim lives long after the storm passes.14 infections of cuts and bruises can be greatly amplified by wading in sewage-polluted water large areas of standing water caused by flooding also contribute to mosquito-borne illnesses furthermore crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation.14  flooding in seminole county florida from tropical storm fay  although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the southwestern united states and parts of Mexico.17 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons.18 hurricane camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path,19 though it also killed 259people and caused usd in damage  on the other hand the occurrence of tropical cyclones can cause tremendous variability in rainfall over the areas they affect indeed cyclones are the primary cause of the most extreme rainfall variability in the world observed in places such as onslow and port hedland in subtropical australia where the annual rainfall can range from practically nothing with no cyclones to over 1,000 millimetres if cyclones are abundant  tornadoesedit  main article history of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes  the broad rotation of a land falling tropical cyclone often spawns tornadoes particularly in their right front quadrant while these tornadoes are normally not as strong as their non-tropical counterparts heavy damage or loss of life can still occur tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall.20  deathsedit  deaths per year from tropical cyclones  australia  521  united states  2522  east asia  74023  globally  1000022  during the last two centuries tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1.9million people worldwide it is estimated that 10,000people per year perish due to tropical cyclones.22 the deadliest tropical cyclone was the 1970 bhola cyclone which had a death toll of anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 lives  united statesedit  before hurricane katrina the average death rate for tropical cyclones in the united states was decreasing the main cause of storm-related fatalities was shifting away from storm surge and towards freshwater flooding.24 however the median death rate per storm had increased through 1979, with a lull during the 19801995 period this was due to greater numbers of people moving to the coastal margins and into harms way despite advances in warning strategies and reduction in track forecast error this increase in fatalities is expected to continue for as long as people migrate towards the shore.25  reconstruction and repopulationedit  aerial image of destroyed houses in tacloban following typhoon haiyan  while tropical cyclones may well seriously damage settlement total destruction encourages rebuilding for example the destruction wrought by hurricane camille on the gulf coast spurred redevelopment greatly increasing local property values.19 research indicates that the typical hurricane strike raises real house prices for a number of years with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence.26 however disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms hurricane katrina is the most obvious example as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after hurricane camille many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well  in isolated areas with small populations tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties to contribute to the founders effect as survivors repopulate their place for example around 1775, a typhoon hit pingelap atoll and in combination with a subsequent famine reduced the islands population to a low level several generations after the disaster as many as 10 of pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia.27 this is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.27  hurricane isabel effect on the north carolina outer banks  effects on natural resourcesedit  geomorphologyedit  tropical cyclones reshape the geology near the coast by eroding sand from the beach as well as offshore rearranging coral and changing dune configuration onshore their rain water gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts  coastal ridgesedit  waves and storm surges accompanying tropical cyclones erode undersea sands erode shell deposits break off corals from near shore reefs in their paths and carry all this detritus landwards in a rolling wave of material that is deposited onshore above highest astronomical tide as a ridge of sand shell and coral.28 for example each severe tropical cyclone Category45 on the saffir-simpson scale crossing northeast australias tropical coastline since the last significant change in sea levels 5000years ago has such ridges within the coastal landscape forming in some places series of ridges and a geomorphological record of highest magnitude cyclones hitting the coast over 3000 5000years.29  eyewitness accounts verify ridges of this kind are formed by severe tropical cyclones and two clear examples cited are the 18 kilometres long 35 metres wide 3.5 metres high coral shingle ridge deposited on funafuti atoll south pacific by cyclone bebe in october 1972, and the large coral shingle ridge deposited on jaluit atoll islands by typhoon ophelia in january 1958. in tropical northeast australia an intense tropical cyclone hit in march 1918 over the town of innisfail at which time there were eyewitness accounts of a 4.5 metres to 5.1 metres high ridge of pumice being deposited by that cyclones surge as it crossed the coast..28  limestone cave stalagmitesedit  when tropical cyclones cross land thin layers of calcium carbonate of composition unusual isotopic ratio of Oxygen-18 and Oxygen-16 are deposited onto stalagmites in limestone caves up to 300 kilometres from the cyclones path.29  as the cloud tops of tropical cyclones are high and cold and their air is humid their rainwater is in other words the rainfall contains significantly higher quantities of unevaporated Oxygen-18 than other tropical rainfall the isotopically lighter rainwater soaks into the ground percolates down into caves and within a couple of weeks Oxygen-18 transfers from the water into calcium carbonate before being deposited in thin layers or within stalagmites a succession of such events created within stalagmites maintain a record of cyclones tracking within a 300 kilometres radius of caves going back centuries millennia or even millions of years.30  at actun tunichil muknal cave in central belize researchers drilling stalagmites with a computer- controlled dental drill accurately identified and verified evidence of isotopically light rainfall for 11 tropical cyclones occurring over a 23-year period  at the chillagoe limestone caves in northeast australia kilometres inland from cairns researchers identified and matched evidence of isotopically light rainfall with 100years of cyclone records and from this have created a record of tropical cyclones from 2004 back to 1200 ad 800-year record.29  landscapesedit  severe tropical cyclones defoliate tropical forest canopy trees remove vines and epiphytes from the trees break tree crown stems and cause tree falls the degree of damage they do along their paths at a landscape level 10 kilometres can be catastrophic yet variable and patchy.31 trees break at 42ms, regardless of size and type.3233 stripping trees and scattering forest debris also provides fuel for wildfires such as a blaze that lasted three months in 1989 and burned 460 square miles of forest that had been stripped by hurricane Gilbert.34  wind velocity gradients or horizontal wind shear of cyclone the intensity of cyclone proximity to the cyclone and local scale cyclonic convection effects  degree of exposure exposure leeward acceleration or local topographic shelteringshading and  ecosystem species composition and forest structure  assessments of cyclone damage done to tropical rainforest landscapes in northeast australia have produced the following typology for describing and the variable impacts they have along their paths as follows35  severe and extensive closest to the centre of cyclone impact appears to be multidirectional and is evidenced by crowns of most trees having been broken smashed or windthrown  severe and localised closer to the cyclone centre than its edge direction of the destructive winds is clearly identifiable and severe canopy disruption is limited to the windward aspect of these forested areas  moderate canopy disturbance closer to cyclone edge than its centre most of the tree stems are still standing with only some treefalls and most of the damage is the defoliation of the canopy and branch breakage  slight canopy disturbance closest to cyclone edge occasional stem fall or branch breakage with most of the damage consisting of loss of foliage on the forest edges only subsequently followed by leaf damage and heavy leaf litter falls  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  tropical cyclones and climate change  list of wettest tropical cyclones by country  referencesedit  national oceanic
