historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on august 25, the us national hurricane center reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of disturbed weather that was located about 1,400km to the southeast of the cape verde Islands.1 during that day the depression gradually developed further as it moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure that was located to the north of the system before during the next day the nhc reported that the system had become a tropical storm and named it david becoming a hurricane on august 27, it moved west-northwestward before entering a period of rapid intensification which brought it to an intensity of 150mph on august 28. slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane ravaged the tiny windward island of dominica on the 29th.2 david continued west-northwest and intensified into a Category5 hurricane in the northeast caribbean sea reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175mph and minimum central pressure of 924 millibars on august 30. an upper-level trough pulled david northward into hispaniola as a Category5 hurricane on the august 31. the eye passed almost directly over santo domingo capital of the dominican republic with over a million people living there at the time the storm crossed over the island and emerged as a weak hurricane after drenching the islands.2  hurricane david shortly after landfall in florida on september 3  after crossing the windward passage david struck eastern cuba as a minimal hurricane on september 1. it weakened to a tropical storm over land but quickly re-strengthened as it again reached open waters david turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge and re-intensified to a Category2 hurricane while over the bahamas where it caused heavy damage despite initial forecasts of a projected landfall in miami florida the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near west palm beach florida on september 3. it paralleled the florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western atlantic ocean at new smyrna beach florida later on september 3. david continued to the north-northwest and made its final landfall just south of savannah georgia as a minimal hurricane on september 5. it turned to the northeast while weakening over land and became extratropical on the 6th over new york as an extratropical storm david continued to the northeast over new england and the canadian Maritimes.2 david intensified once more as it crossed the far north atlantic clipping northwestern iceland before moving eastward well north of the faroe islands on september 10.3  preparationsedit  in the days prior to hitting dominica david was originally expected to hit barbados and spare dominica in the process however on august 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150mph hurricane to make a direct hit on the southern part of Dominica.5 even as it became increasingly clear that david was headed for the island residents did not appear to take the situation seriously this can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent furthermore dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population this proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.56  some 400,000people evacuated in the united states in anticipation of David,2 including 300,000 in southeastern florida due to a predicted landfall between the florida keys and palm beach of those 78,000 fled to shelters while others either stayed at a friends house further inland or traveled northward making landfall during labor day weekend david forced the cancellations of many activities in the greater miami area.7  impactedit  region  deaths  damage  ref

been responsible for 2,068 deaths making it one of the deadliest hurricanes of the modern era it caused torrential damage across its path most of which occurred in the dominican republic where the hurricane made landfall as a category 5 hurricane  dominicaedit  during the storms onslaught david dropped up to 10inches of rain causing numerous landslides on the mountainous island.9 hours of hurricane-force winds severely eroded the coastlines and washed out coastal roads.5  damage was greatest in the southwest portion of the island especially in the capital city roseau which resembled an air raid target after the storms passage strong winds from hurricane david destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes woodon the island,6 leaving 75 percent of the population homeless,9 with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath.5 in addition the rainfall turned rivers into torrents sweeping away everything in their path to the sea.6 power lines were completely ripped out causing the water system to stop as well  most severely damaged was the agricultural industry the worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts of which about 75 percent of the crop was destroyed.9 banana fields were completely destroyed and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down citrus trees fared better due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees.5 in addition davids winds uprooted many trees on the tops of mountains leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.6  in all 56people died in dominica and 180 were injured.29 property and agricultural damage figures in dominica are unknown.2  lesser antillesedit  aside from dominica other islands in the lesser antilles experienced minor to moderate damage just to the south of dominica david brought martinique winds of up to 100mph and 140mph sustained gust in the northeast of the coast of the caravelle the capital fort-de-france reported wave heights of 15feet and experienced strong tropical storm sustained winds at 56mph and gust at 78mph davids strong winds caused severe crop damage mostly to bananas amounting to in 2007USD in losses though no deaths were reported the hurricane caused 20 to 30 injuries and left 500 homeless.9  guadeloupe experienced moderate to extensive damage on basse-terre island there the banana crop was completely destroyed and combined with other losses crop damage amounted to in 2005USD. david caused no deaths a few injuries and left several hundred homeless nearby marie-galante and les saintes reported some extreme damage while grande-terre had some moderate damages.9  the island of st croix in the us virgin islands experienced significant rainfall amounting to 1012inches but fairly minor damages  puerto ricoedit  total rainfall map of david in puerto rico  hurricane david was originally going to hit the south coast of the united states territory of puerto rico but a change in course in the middle of the night spared it the damage that the dominican republic suffered  though it did not hit puerto rico hurricane david passed less than 100miles south of the island bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island portions of southwestern puerto rico experienced sustained winds of up to 85mph while the rest of the island received tropical storm-force winds while passing by the island the hurricane caused strong seas10 and torrential rainfall amounting to 19.9inches in mayagez puerto rico and up to 20inches in the central mountainous region.2  despite remaining offshore most of the island felt davids effects agricultural damage was severe and combined with property damage the hurricane was responsible for in losses in 2005USD.29 following the storm the fema declared the island a disaster area in all hurricane david killed seven people in puerto rico four of which resulted from electrocutions.9  dominican republicedit  upon making landfall in the dominican republic david turned unexpectedly to the northwest causing 125mph winds in santo domingo and Category5 winds elsewhere in the country the storm caused torrential rainfall resulting in extreme river flooding.2 the flooding swept away entire villages and isolated communities during the storms onslaught a rail-mounted container crane collapsed in rio haina at the sea-land terminal many roads in the country were either damaged or destroyed from the heavy rainfall especially in the towns of jarabacoa san cristobal and Ban.9  nearly 70 of the countrys crops were destroyed from the torrential flooding.11 extreme river flooding resulted in most of the countrys 2,000 fatalities.2 one particularly deadly example of this was when a rampaging river in the mountainous village of padre las casas swept away a church and a school killing several hundred people who were sheltering there.11 the flooding destroyed thousands of houses leaving over 200,000 homeless in the aftermath of the hurricane.2 president antonio guzmn fernndez estimated the combination of agricultural property and industrial damage to amount to in 2005USD.11  neighboring haiti experienced very little from david due to the hurricanes weakened state upon moving through the country.2  bahamasedit  while passing through the bahamas david brought 7080mph winds to andros island as the eye crossed the archipelago david though still disorganized produced heavy rainfall in the country peaking at 8inches strong wind gusts uprooted trees and overall damage was minimal.12  united statesedit  total rainfall map of david in the united states east coast  david produced widespread damage across the united states amounting to in 2005USD. prior to the hurricanes arrival 400,000 evacuated from coastal areas in total david directly killed five in the united states and was responsible for ten indirect deaths.2  floridaedit  upon making landfall david brought a storm surge of only two-fourfeet due to its lack of strengthening and the obtuse angle at which it hit.2 in addition david caused strong surf and moderate rainfall amounting to a maximum of 8.92inches in vero Beach.11 though it made landfall as a Category2 storm the strongest winds were localized and the highest reported wind occurred in fort pierce with 70mph sustained and 95mph gusts.13  because the hurricane remained near the coastline hurricane david failed to cause extreme damage in florida the storms winds shattered windows in stores near the coast and caused property damage including blowing the frame of the palm beach jai alai fronton and downing the 186-foot wjno am radio tower in west palm beach into the intracoastal waterway a few roofs were torn off and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches of rainfall a 450-foot crane was even snapped in two at the st lucie nuclear power Plant.7 the hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state though none caused deaths or injuries.14 total damages in florida amounted to million million in 2005 usd of which million occurred in palm beach county mostly from crop damage.7 two journalists with today newspaper from brevard county followed the hurricane path from south florida to cocoa fl and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane  georgiaedit  hurricane david making landfall in georgia on september 4  hurricane david made landfall in georgia as a quickly weakening minimal hurricane bringing a threefivefoot storm surge and heavy surf its inner core remained away from major cities though savannah recorded sustained winds of 58mph and wind gusts of 68mph no major damage occurred in Savannah.15 high winds downed numerous power lines leaving many without power for up to twoweeks after the storm.16 offshore strong seas disrupted a portion of the coastal reef by moving a sunken ship 300feet overall hurricane david was responsible for minor damage and two casualties from its heavy surf.11  southeast mid-atlantic and new englandedit  upon entering south carolina david retained winds of up to hurricane force though the highest recorded was 43mph sustained in charleston and a 70mph wind gust in hilton head island numerous us navy ships that were in port at the charleston naval station sortied several of which the frigate USSBowenFF-1079 and the destroyer tender USSSierraAD-18 sustained severe damage riding the storm out at seacitation needed similar winds occurred in north carolina and lesser readings were recorded throughout the northeastern united states excluding a 174mph wind gust on mount washington in new hampshire in addition david dropped heavy rainfall along its path peaking at 10.73inches in cape hatteras north carolina with widespread reports of over fiveinches storm surge was moderate peaking at 8.8feet in charleston and up to fivefeet along much of the eastern united states coastline.2  overall damage was light in most areas though it was very widespread high winds and rain downed power lines in the new york city area leaving 2.5million people without electricity during the storms passage.2 david also caused minor to moderate beach erosion as well as widespread crop damage from the flooding.18 in addition the hurricane spawned numerous tornadoes while moving through the mid-atlantic and new england with associated prominent wind damage occurring even in inland communities in virginia eight tornadoes formed across the southeastern portion of the state of which six were F2s or greater on the fujita scale the tornadoes caused one death 19 injuries damaged 270 homes and destroyed three homes amounting to in 2005USD in losses in maryland davids outer bands formed seven tornadoes.19 in new castle county delaware an F2 tornado damaged numerous homes and injured five.20  aftermathedit  dominicaedit  immediately after the storm lack of power prevented communications and the outside world had little knowledge of the extent of the damage in dominica a citizen named fred white ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.5  in response to the severe agricultural damage the government initiated a food ration by two months after the storm assistance pledges amounted to over us from various groups around the world similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material or lack thereof for the affected citizens.5 the hurricane destroyed some important landmarks including a significant part of the ruins of the fort young which had stood since the 1770s.21  another occurrence less typical of the aftermath of other natural disasters was the looting in supermarkets seaports and homes what was not destroyed by the hurricanes was stolen in the weeks after the storm.6  hms fife royal navy county class destroyer was on its way back to the united kingdom when the hurricane struck and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island sailing through mountainous seas the fife docked in the main harbor at roseau without assistance and was the only outside help for several days the crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings the airstrip and restoring power and water the ships helicopter humphrey took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees the ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance this was the first time a royal navy ship had provided a public broadcast news servicecitation needed  united statesedit  despite the casualties and damages attributed to david the storms effects were not as bad as in other countries in particular south florida escaped relatively lightly because of this then nhc director neil frank was accused of overly stirring up panic before the arrival of david two local psychiatrists even claimed that the experience would make residents more complacent towards future storms however the nhc defended their methods with frank stating we hadnt public alarm and our predictions had been more accurate the consequences would have been disastrous.7 one reporter who covered hurricane david was dick baumbach a journalist with today newspaper now known as florida today he along with news photographer scott maclay followed the path of the hurricane from miami to central florida in cocoa beach baumbach decided to ride out the hurricane in his home with two other journalists while it was a difficult and trying experience all three reporters survived and ended up winning numerous awards the hurricane also interrupted the filming of the movie caddyshack that was taking place at the rolling hills country club in fort lauderdale  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  the name david was
