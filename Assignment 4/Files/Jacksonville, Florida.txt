ford from bernard romans 1776 map of florida  the area of the modern city of jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years on black hammock island in the national timucuan ecological and historic preserve a university of north florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the united states dating to 2500 BC.18 in the 16th century the beginning of the historical era the region was inhabited by the mocama a coastal subgroup of the timucua people at the time of contact with europeans all mocama villages in present-day jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the saturiwa centered around the mouth of the st johns River.19 one early map shows a village called ossachite at the site of what is now downtown jacksonville this may be the earliest recorded name for that area.20  replica of jean ribaults column claiming florida for france in 1562.  french huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st johns river in 1562, calling it the river of may because that was the month of his discovery ribault erected a stone column at the site claiming the newly discovered land for France.21 in 1564, ren goulaine de laudonnire established the first european settlement fort caroline on the st johns near the main village of the saturiwa philip ii of spain ordered pedro menndez de avils to protect the interest of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline on september 20, 1565, a spanish force from the nearby spanish settlement of st augustine attacked fort caroline and killed nearly all the french soldiers defending it.22 the spanish renamed the fort san mateo and following the ejection of the french st augustines position as the most important settlement in florida was solidified the location of fort caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the st johns river in 1964.23  spain ceded florida to the british in 1763 after the french and indian war and the british soon constructed the kings road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.242526 the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber as a result the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish.27 britain ceded control of the territory to spain in 1783, after being defeated in the american revolutionary war and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821, american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town laying out the streets and plats they soon named the town jacksonville after andrew jackson led by isaiah d hart residents wrote a charter for a town government which was approved by the florida legislative council on february 9, 1832.  civil war and the gilded ageedit  union army guard house on bay street in december 1864.  during the american civil war jacksonville was a key supply point

jacksonville proper the city changed hands several times between union and confederate forces in the skirmish of the brick church in 1862, confederates won their first victory in the state.28 however union forces captured a confederate position at the battle of st johns bluff and occupied jacksonville in 1862. slaves escaped to freedom in union lines in february 1864 union forces left jacksonville and confronted a confederate army at the battle of olustee going down to defeat  union forces retreated to jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war in march 1864 a confederate cavalry confronted a union expedition in the battle of cedar creek warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war.29  during reconstruction and the gilded age jacksonville and nearby st augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad president grover cleveland attended the sub-tropical exposition in the city on february 22, 1888 during his trip to Florida.30 this highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism the citys tourism however was dealt major blows in the late 19th

increase spending to fund new public building projects in the postwar economic boom mayor w haydon burns jacksonville story resulted in the construction of a new city hall civic auditorium public

level of poverty overall.37  given the postwar migration of residents businesses and jobs the citys tax base declined it had difficulty funding education sanitation and traffic control within the city limits in addition residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services such as sewage and building code enforcement in 1958, a study recommended that the city of

wanted more involvement in government after passage of civil rights legislation restored their ability to vote and whites in the suburbs who wanted more services and more control over the central city in 1964 all 15 of duval countys public high schools lost their accreditation this added momentum to proposals for government reform lower taxes increased economic development unification of the community better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government  when a consolidation referendum was held in 1967,
