the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the incipient tropical wave that became dennis was identified on June26, 2005, well-inland over Africa123 it later emerged over the atlantic ocean on June29 and moved briskly to the west.1 dry air initially inhibited development,45 though once this abated the wave was able to consolidate into a tropical depression on July4.1 the depression soon crossed grenada before entering the caribbean sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures fueled intensification.678 turning west-northwest the system achieved tropical storm status on July5 and hurricane status the following day.1 formation of a well-defined eye and central dense overcast signaled denniss intensification into a major hurricane on July7.19 throughout this phase the hurricane traversed the jamaica channel bringing deadly floods to both jamaica and Haiti.1  the powerful storm soon struck granma province cuba as a Category4 early on July8 violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage briefly weakening due to interaction with land dennis quickly regained its strength paralleling the western coast of cuba dennis attained its peak winds of 150mph later that day before making a second landfall in the country this time in matanzas Province.1 resumed interaction with the mountains of cuba caused significant weakening10 however once dennis emerged over the gulf of mexico on July9, it was able to quickly reorganize the hurricane reached Category4 strength for a third time on July10 as it approached florida attaining its lowest barometric pressure of 930mbar 27.46inHg.1 this ranked dennis as the strongest pre-august hurricane in the atlantic basin however this was eclipsed just six days later by hurricane emily which was the first july Category5 on record.1112 weakening ensued as the hurricane approached the florida panhandle ultimately making landfall over santa rosa island on July10 as a Category3. dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week traversing the mississippi river valley and ohio river valley before finally dissipating over ontario on July18.1  preparationsedit  caribbeanedit  in haiti officials evacuated residents along
