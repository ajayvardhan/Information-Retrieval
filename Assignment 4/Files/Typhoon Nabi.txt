brushing south korea the storm turned to the northeast passing over hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September8.  the typhoon first affected the northern marianas islands where it left US2.5million in damagenb 1 while damaging or destroying 114homes. the damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the united states government while passing near okinawa nabi produced

large area of convection persisted about 1,035km east of guam located within an area of moderate wind shear the system quickly organized while moving westward its track influenced by a ridge to the north.2 at 0000UTC on August29, a tropical depression formed from the system,3 classified by the joint typhoon warning center 3 as tropical depression 14W. in initial forecasts the agency anticipated steady strengthening,5 due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area.6 at 1200UTC on August29, the japan meteorological agency 4 upgraded it to a tropical storm.7 as such the jma named the storm nabinb 52 about 12hours later the jma upgraded nabi further to a severe tropical storm,3 after the convection organized into spiral rainbands.6 at 1800UTC, nabi intensified to typhoon status reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120kmh  on August31, nabi passed about 55km north-northeast of saipan in the northern mariana islands during its closest approach.8 the typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest on September1, the jtwc upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one-minute winds of 260kmh this is the equivalent of a Category5 on the saffir-simpson scale by contrast the jma estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175kmh on September2, with a barometric pressure of 925mbar while at peak intensity the typhoon developed a large 95km wide eye.9 for about 36hours, nabi maintained its peak winds during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA23 the philippine-based agency gave it the local name although the storm remained away from the country.2  typhoon nabi on september 3, 2005, as seen from the international space station  on September3, nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge.2 later that day the winds leveled off at 155kmh according to the jma on September5, nabi passed near kitadaitjima and yakushima part of the dait and sumi island groups offshore southern Japan.7 around that time the jtwc estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215kmh after turning due north nabi made landfall near isahaya nagasaki around 0500UTC on September6, after passing through the amakusa of Kumamoto.10 shortly thereafter the storm entered the sea of Japan.7 the typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid-latitude flow influenced by a low over the kamchatka Peninsula.11 at 1800UTC on September6, the jtwc discontinued advisories on nabi declaring it extratropical,12 although the jma continued tracking the storm on the next day nabi moved across northern hokkaido into the sea of okhotsk the jma declared the storm as extratropical on September8, which continued eastward until dissipating on September10 south of the aleutian Islands.7 the remnants of nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern alaska on September12.13  preparationsedit  typhoon nabi making landfall in kyushu on
