crossover from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean forming late on November20 in the southwestern caribbean sea otto was the fifteenth and final named storm seventh hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it quickly intensified into a strong tropical storm the next day and on November2324, rapidly strengthened into a category 3 major hurricane the first in the month of november since hurricane paloma in 2008, and the latest date an atlantic hurricane attained such intensity on record.1 otto made landfall in nicaragua at peak intensity on November24, thus becoming the latest hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin since 1851 when records began.1 traveling along the nicaraguacosta rica border the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging over the eastern pacific ocean becoming the final storm of the 2016 pacific hurricane season as well hostile environmental conditions inhibited reorganization and otto subsequently degenerated into an elongated trough on November26.  the hurricanes unusually southern formation in the caribbean sea led to impacts in countries rarely affected by tropical cyclones in particular panama and costa rica suffered extensive damage the storm claimed at least 23lives 10 in costa rica 9 in panama and 4 in nicaragua otto also dropped torrential rainfall across the affected regions some areas received up towards a months worth of rain in only a matter of a day which led to life-threatening flooding which in turn led to landslides after the storm had passed recovery efforts begun with the national mourning of the victims followed by clean-up efforts overall total economic losses from the hurricane exceeded US190million.  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations

storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on November12, the national hurricane center first noted the potential for a low pressure area to develop in the southwestern caribbean sea assessing a low probability for tropical cyclone formation within five days.2 after a convectively coupled kelvin wave and several nearby tropical waves interacted with each other in the aforementioned area atmospheric pressure in that region began falling on November14,3 resulting in a broad low pressure area forming north of colombia on november 15.1 the low moved slowly and erratically with a disorganized structure and light winds,4 disrupted by unfavorable upper-level conditions.5 on November19, the convection increased and became better organized amid marginally favorable conditions.6 the hurricane hunters flew into the system on November20, observing a well-defined circulation and the system became a tropical depression at 1800UTC that day.1  a series of microwave satellite images depicting the inner structure of hurricane otto as it traversed central america note that despite crossing land its eye remained largely intact  the nascent depression meandered over the southwestern caribbean sea its path to the north blocked by a ridge.7 thunderstorm activity continued to pulse over the center,8 and the inner core of convection became more organized the depression intensified into a tropical storm by 0600UTC on November21, receiving the name Otto.1 the storm had well-established outflow to the northeast fueled by warm water temperatures of around 84F after the convection organized into a central dense overcast otto became a strong tropical storm with 70mph winds and maintained that intensity for about a day on november 23, the storm reached hurricane intensity and began a period of rapid intensification reaching category 2 intensity by 0600UTC the following day with winds of 105mph six hours later otto reached its peak intensity as a category 3 major hurricane with winds of 115mph becoming the latest major hurricane on record in the satellite era.110 at 1730UTC, otto made landfall over the indio maz biological reserve in southeastern nicaragua roughly 12 miles northwest of the nicaraguacosta rica border at peak intensity this marked the southernmost landfall of a hurricane in central america since reliable records began eclipsing hurricane ireneolivia of 1971 by 30 to 35 miles to 55km.1  after landfall ottos structure remained well-organized as it moved roughly parallel to the costa rica-nicaraguan border although cloud tops warmed indicating diminishing convection.11 despite moving over land the hurricanes eye remained well-defined and intact as it traverse nicaragua and costa Rica.1 otto was the first atlantic hurricane on record to have its eye cross over costa Rica,10 and the first hurricane-force system to traverse the nation.1 around 0330UTC on November25, the eye of otto emerged over the eastern pacific near the gulf of papagayo completing a rare crossover from the atlantic to eastern pacific basinthe first such occurrence in which an atlantic tropical cyclone retained its name after a change in nhc naming policy in 2000.1 concurrently the system weakened to a tropical storm continuing to move westwards due to the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north otto steadily weakened as it moved away from central america unfavorable environmental conditions hastened the systems demise and otto weakened to a tropical depression on November26. soon thereafter the system degraded into a trough roughly 490mi south of salina cruz mexico the remnant system continued to produce scattered convection for a few more days before dissipating entirely.1  preparations impact and aftermathedit  panamaedit  tropical storm

issued for the coast of nicaragua on november 22,14 which was upgraded into a warning the next day.15 schools were closed for the coming days as otto approached and about 10,000 were in the process of being evacuated.16 officials also feared that otto could damage the nations coffee crops which were close to being able to fully harvest.16  rainfall across nicaragua generally amounted to 3 to 6in to 152mm in southern and southwestern portions of the country a peak value of 6.35in was observed in el Castillo.1 throughout the country otto damaged 857houses, eight schools and two health facilities

damage the agriculture supply in the nation  otto was the first hurricane to pass directly over costa rica since records began.1 in costa rica some areas near the border with nicaragua observed over a months worth of rainfall20 three-day accumulations exceeded 8in in many areas the highest recorded total was 12.11in at the miravalles Volcano.1 the national meteorological institute of costa rica
