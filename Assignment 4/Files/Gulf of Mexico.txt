south by mexico and on the southeast by cuba the us states of texas louisiana mississippi alabama and florida border the gulf on the north which are often referred to as the coast in comparison with the us atlantic and pacific coasts or sometimes the coast in juxtaposition to the great lakes region being the coast one of the gulfs seven main areas is the gulf of mexico basin  the gulf of mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics.3 the gulfs basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles 930mi wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments it is connected to part of the atlantic ocean through the florida straits between the us and cuba and with the caribbean which it forms the american mediterranean sea via the yucatn channel between mexico and cuba with the narrow connection to the atlantic the gulf experiences very small tidal ranges the size of the gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters the basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters quadrillion imperial gallons 660 quadrillion us gallons 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi.4

in the gulf of mexico  the consensus among geologists367 who have studied the geology of the gulf of mexico is that prior to the late triassic the gulf of mexico did not exist before the late triassic the area now occupied by the gulf of mexico consisted of dry land which included continental crust that now underlies yucatn within the middle of the large supercontinent of pangea this land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central mexico through the marathon uplift in west texas and the ouachita mountains of oklahoma and to alabama where it linked directly to the appalachian mountains it was created by the collision of continental plates that formed pangea as interpreted by roy van arsdale and randel t cox this mountain range was breached in late cretaceous times by the formation of the mississippi Embayment.89  geologists and other earth scientists agree in general that the present gulf of mexico basin originated in late triassic time as the result of rifting within Pangea.10 the rifting was associated with zones of weakness within pangea including sutures where the laurentia south american and african plates collided to create it first there was a late triassic-early jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds second as rifting progressed through early and middle jurassic time continental crust was stretched and thinned this thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust which is half the typical thickness 35 kilometers of normal continental crust it was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the pacific ocean across central mexico and later eastward to the atlantic ocean this flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the gulf of mexico while the gulf of mexico was a restricted basin the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of louann salt and associated anhydrite evaporites initially during the late jurassic continued rifting widened the gulf of mexico and progressed to the point that sea-floor spreading and formation of oceanic crust occurred at this point sufficient circulation with the atlantic ocean was established that the deposition of louann salt ceased.671112  during the late jurassic through early cretaceous the basin occupied by the gulf of mexico experienced a period of cooling and subsidence of the crust underlying it the subsidence was the result of a combination of crustal stretching cooling and loading initially the combination of crustal stretching and cooling caused about 57km of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust because subsidence occurred faster than sediment could fill it the gulf of mexico expanded and deepened.61213  later loading of the crust within the gulf of mexico and adjacent coastal plain by the accumulation of kilometers of sediments during the rest of the mesozoic and all of the cenozoic further depressed the underlying crust to its current position about 1020km below sea level particularly during the cenozoic thick clastic wedges built out the continental shelf along the northwestern and northern margins of the gulf of Mexico.61213  to the east the stable florida platform was not covered by the sea until the latest jurassic or the beginning of cretaceous time the yucatn platform was emergent until the mid-cretaceous after both platforms were submerged the formation of carbonates and evaporites has characterized the geologic history of these two stable areas most of the basin was rimmed during the early cretaceous by carbonate platforms and its western flank was involved during the latest cretaceous and early paleogene periods in a compressive deformation episode the laramide orogeny which created the sierra madre oriental of eastern Mexico.14  in 2002 geologist michael stanton published a speculative essay suggesting an impact origin for the gulf of mexico at the close of the permian which could have caused the permiantriassic extinction event.15 however gulf coast geologists do not regard this hypothesis as having any credibility instead they overwhelmingly accept plate tectonics not an asteroid impact as having created the gulf of mexico as illustrated by papers authored by kevin mickus and others.371216 this hypothesis is not to be confused with the chicxulub crater a large impact crater on the coast of the gulf of mexico on the yucatn peninsula  today the gulf of mexico has the following 7 main areas14  gulf of mexico basin which contains the sigsbee deep and can be further divided into the continental rise the

although katrina cooled waters in its path by up to 4 c they had rebounded by the time of ritas appearance  although christopher columbus was credited with the discovery of the americas by europeans the ships in his four voyages never reached the gulf of mexico instead columbus sailed into the caribbean around cuba and hispaniola the first european exploration of the gulf of mexico was by amerigo vespucci in 1497. he followed the coastal land mass of central america before returning to the atlantic ocean via the straits of florida between florida and cuba in his letters vespucci described this trip and once juan de la cosa returned to spain a famous world map depicting cuba as an island was produced  in 1506, hernn corts took part in the conquest of hispaniola and cuba receiving a large estate of land and indian slaves for his effort in 1510, he accompanied diego velzquez de cullar an aide of the governor of hispaniola in his expedition to conquer cuba in 1518 velzquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of mexico for colonization  in 1517, francisco hernndez de crdoba discovered the yucatn peninsula this was the first european encounter with an advanced civilization in the americas with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the old world they also had reason to expect that this new land would have gold all of this encouraged two further expeditions the first in 1518 under the command of juan de grijalva and the second in 1519 under the command of hernn corts which led to the spanish exploration military invasion and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the conquest of mexico hernndez did not live to see the continuation of his work he died in 1517, the year of his expedition as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage and disappointed in the knowledge that diego velzquez had given precedence to grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to yucatn  in 1523, ngel de villafae sailed toward mexico city but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of padre island texas in 1554. when word of the disaster reached mexico city the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent villafae marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels villafae traveled to pnuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site which had already been visited from that community he arrived in time to greet garca de escalante alvarado nephew of pedro de alvarado commander of the salvage operation when alvarado arrived by sea on july 22, 1554. the team labored until september 12 to salvage the padre island treasure this loss in combination with other ship disasters around the gulf of mexico gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern gulf coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways as a result the expedition of tristn de luna y arellano was sent and landed at pensacola bay on august 15, 1559.  on december 11, 1526, charles v granted pnfilo de narvez a license to claim what is now the gulf coast of the united states known as the narvez expedition the contract gave him one year to gather an army leave spain be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast on april 7, 1528, they spotted land north of what is now tampa bay they turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot miruelo knew of sometime during these two days one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast but nothing else is known of it  in 1697, pierre le moyne diberville sailed for france and was chosen by the minister of marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the mississippi river and to colonize louisiana which the english coveted ibervilles fleet sailed from brest on october 24, 1698. on january 25, 1699, iberville reached santa rosa island in front of pensacola founded by the spanish he sailed from there to mobile bay and explored massacre island later renamed dauphin island he cast anchor between cat island and ship island and on february 13, 1699, he went to the mainland biloxi with his brother jean-baptiste le moyne de Bienville.17 on may 1, 1699, he completed a fort on the north-east side of the bay of biloxi a little to the rear of what is now ocean springs mississippi this fort was known as fort maurepas or old biloxi a few days later on may 4, pierre le moyne sailed for france leaving his teenage brother jean-baptiste le moyne as second in command to the french commandant  shipwrecksedit  the mardi gras shipwreck around the early-19th century about 35 miles off the coast of louisiana in 4,000 feet meters of water she is believed to have been a privateer or trader the shipwreck whose real identity remains a mystery lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the okeanos gas gathering company in may 2007, an expedition led by texas am university and funded by oggc under an agreement with the minerals management service boem was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the louisiana state museum as part of the project educational outreach nautilus productions in partnership with boem texas am university the florida public archaeology Network18 and veolia environmental

southeast of the entrance to the mississippi river when the explosion destroyed the hold vented through the b and c decks and damaged the engines the radio compartment and the steering gear after the attack she was under escort by the uss PC-566, captained by lcdr herbert g claudius en route to new orleans the uss PC-566 began dropping depth charges on a sonar contact sinking the U-166. the badly damaged robert e lee first listed to port then to starboard and finally sank within about 15 minutes of the attack one officer nine crewmen and 15 passengers were lost ironically the passengers aboard the robert e lee were primarily survivors of previous torpedo attacks by german U-boats.21 the wrecks precise location was discovered during the c c marine survey that located the U-166.  the german submarine U-166 was a type ixc u-boat of nazi germanys kriegsmarine during world war ii the submarine was laid down on december 6, 1940 at the seebeckwerft of deutsche schiff- und maschinenbau ag deschimag at wesermnde bremerhaven as yard number 705, launched on november 1, 1941 and commissioned on march 23, 1942 under the command of oberleutnant zur see hans-gnther kuhlmann after training with the 4th u-boat flotilla U-166 was transferred to the 10th u-boat flotilla for front-line service on june 1, 1942. the u-boat sailed on only two war patrols and sank four ships totalling 7,593gross register tonsGRT.22 she was sunk on july 30, 1942 in gulf of Mexico.23  in 2001 the wreck of U-166 was located in 5,000 feet m of water less than two miles from where it had attacked the robert e lee an archaeological survey of the seafloor prior to construction of a natural gas pipeline led to the discoveries by c c marine archaeologists robert a church and daniel j warren the sonar contacts consisted of two large sections lying approximately 500 feet apart at either end of a debris field that indicated the presence of a U-boat.24  geographyedit  gulf beach near sabine pass  the

northernmost tip of quintana roo the mexican portion of the gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles on its southeast quadrant the gulf is bordered by cuba it supports major american mexican and cuban fishing industries the outer margins of the wide continental shelves of yucatn and florida receive cooler nutrient-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as upwelling which stimulates plankton growth in the euphotic zone this attracts fish shrimp and squid.29 river drainage and atmospheric fallout from industrial coastal cities also provide nutrients to the coastal zone  the gulf stream a warm atlantic ocean current and one of the strongest ocean currents known originates in the gulf as a continuation of the caribbean current-yucatn current-loop current system other circulation features include the anticyclonic gyres which are shed by the loop current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the bay of campeche the bay of campeche in mexico constitutes a major arm of the gulf of mexico additionally the gulfs shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets a number of rivers empty into the gulf most notably the mississippi river and rio grande in the northern gulf and the grijalva and usumacinta rivers in the southern gulf the land that forms the gulfs coast including many long narrow barrier islands is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach  the gulf of mexico is an excellent example of a passive margin the continental shelf is quite wide at most points along the coast most notably at the florida and yucatn peninsulas the shelf is exploited for its oil by means of offshore drilling rigs most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the bay of campeche another important commercial activity is fishing major catches include red snapper amberjack tilefish swordfish and various grouper as well as shrimp and crabs oysters are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds other important industries along the coast include shipping petrochemical processing and storage military use paper manufacture and tourism  the gulfs warm water temperature can feed powerful atlantic hurricanes causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with hurricane katrina in 2005. in the atlantic a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation however the gulf is shallower when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.30  the gulf is considered aseismic however mild tremors have been recorded throughout history 5.0 or less on the richter magnitude scale earthquakes may be caused by interactions between sediment loading on the sea floor and adjustment by the crust.31  2006 earthquakeedit  main article 2006 gulf of mexico earthquake  on september 10, 2006, the us geological survey national earthquake information center reported that a magnitude 6.0 earthquake occurred about 250 miles west-southwest of anna maria florida around 1056 am edt the quake was reportedly felt from louisiana to florida in the southeastern united states there were no reports of damage or injuries.3233 items were knocked from shelves and seiches were observed in swimming pools in parts of Florida.34 the earthquake was described by the usgs as an intraplate earthquake the largest and most widely felt recorded in the past three decades in the region.34 according to the september 11, 2006 issue of the tampa tribune earthquake tremors were last felt in

legislation on march 13, 2009, the clcs accepted mexicos arguments for extending its continental shelf up to 350 nm into the western polygon since this would extend mexicos continental shelf well into

unique subspecies and making them as one of the most endangered whales in the world.37 the gulf of mexico yields more finfish shrimp and shellfish annually than the south and mid-atlantic chesapeake and new england areas combined.4  the smithsonian institution gulf of mexico holdings are expected to provide an important baseline of understanding for future scientific studies on the impact of the deepwater horizon oil spill.38 in congressional testimony dr jonathan coddington associate director of research and collections at the smithsonians national museum of natural history provides a detailed overview of the gulf collections and their sources which museum staff have made available on an online map the samples were collected for years by the former minerals management service the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement to help predict the potential impacts of future oilgas explorations since 1979, the specimens have been deposited in the national collections of the national museum of natural History.39  see also list of invasive marine fish in the gulf of mexico  pollutionedit  dead zone in the gulf of mexico  the major environmental threats to the gulf are agricultural runoff and oil drilling  there are frequent tide algae blooms40 that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore this has especially been plaguing the southwest and southern florida coast from the florida keys to north of pasco county florida  the gulf contains a hypoxic dead zone that runs east-west along the texas-louisiana coastline in july 2008, researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008, the area roughly doubled in size and now stretches from near galveston texas to near venice louisiana it is now about 8,000 square miles nearly the record.41 poor agricultural practices in the northern portion of the gulf of mexico have led to a tremendous increase of nitrogen and phosphorus in neighboring marine ecosystems which has resulted in algae blooms and a lack of available oxygen occurrences of masculinization and estrogen suppression were observed as a result an october 2007 study of the atlantic croaker found a disproportioned sex ratio of 61 males to 39 females in hypoxic gulf sites this was compared with a 52 to 48 male-female ratio found in reference sites showing an impairment of reproductive output for fish populations inhabiting hypoxic coastal zones.42  there are 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells beneath the gulf these have generally not been checked for potential environmental problems.43  ixtoc i explosion and oil spilledit  main articles ixtoc i and ixtoc i oil spill  in june 1979, the ixtoc i oil platform in the bay of campeche suffered a blowout leading to a catastrophic explosion which resulted in a massive oil spill that continued for nine months before the well was finally capped this was ranked as the largest oil spill in the gulf of mexico until the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010.  deepwater horizon explosion and oil spilledit  main articles deepwater horizon explosion and deepwater horizon oil spill  on april 20, 2010, the deepwater horizon oil platform located in the mississippi canyon about 40 miles off the louisiana coast suffered a catastrophic explosion it sank a day-and-a-half later.44 it was in the process of being sealed with cement for temporary abandonment to avoid environmental problems.43 although initial reports indicated that relatively little oil had leaked by april 24, it was claimed by bp that approximately 1,000 barrels of oil per day were issuing from the wellhead about 1-mile below the surface on the ocean floor.45 on april 29, the us government revealed that approximately 5,000 barrels per day five times the original estimate were pouring into the gulf from the wellhead.46 the resulting oil slick quickly expanded to cover hundreds of square miles of ocean surface posing a serious threat to marine life and adjacent coastal wetlands and to the livelihoods of gulf coast shrimpers and fishermen.47 coast guard rear adm sally brice ohare stated that the us government will be
