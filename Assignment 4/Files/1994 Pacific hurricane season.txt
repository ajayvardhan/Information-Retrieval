cyclone season  pacific hurricane seasons  1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996  the 1994 pacific hurricane season was the final season of the eastern north pacifics most recent active string of hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1981. the season officially started on may 15, 1994, in the eastern pacific and on june 1, 1994, in the central pacific and lasted until november 30, 1994. these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean the first tropical cyclone formed on june 18, while the last system dissipated on october 26.1 this season twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes a total of 10 hurricanes occurred including five major hurricanes  of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms hurricanes emilia gilma john and olivia all reached a pressure below 930millibars. longevity-wise no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as hurricane john which lasted 31 days elsewhere hurricane rosa caused four casualties in mexico as the basins lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane and later was responsible for flooding in texas  contents  1 season summary  2 systems  2.1 tropical storm aletta  2.2 tropical storm bud  2.3 hurricane

eastern pacific region to north america nineteen tropical depressions formed of which seventeen became tropical storms nine further intensifying into hurricanes and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of Category3 intensity or higher on the saffir simpson Scale.1 these numbers are slightly above the long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes.2  in the central pacific hurricane centers area of responsibility to the international date line three depressions two tropical storms and one hurricane formed overall there were eleven tropical cyclones eight tropical storms five hurricanes and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the central pacific region.3 these numbers are well above the long-term average of four tropical cyclones two hurricanes one tropical storm and two depressions.4 the exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an el nio ongoing at the time.5  the only named storm to make landfall this year was hurricane Rosa,1 which killed four people in western Mexico6 and forced over 400 to be evacuated.7 other notable storms include hurricane olivia a high-end category 4 system,1 the three Category5 hurricanes emilia gilma and john both john and hurricane li existed in two of the three basins and west of the pacific Ocean.8  this season marked the end of the northeastern pacifics most recent active period which began in 1982,9 and includes the five most active pacific hurricane seasons.19 beginning in 1995, multi-decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane activity.10 since then pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal11 the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997, where a strong el nino event was observed.9  the 1994 pacific hurricane season set several records first three hurricanes reached Category5 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane Scale,8 setting a record later tied in 2002.1 hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history.12 eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central pacific a record shared with the 1992 season until the 2015 season broke the record.5 finally of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific three of them occurred this season.3  the season began with the formation of tropical depression one-e on june 18 and ended with the dissipation of tropical depression nona on october 26.1 no named systems formed in may three in june four in july five in august six in september two in october and none in November.1 the total length of the season from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last was 130 days.13  accumulated cyclone energy

tropical depression one-e formed from an area of disturbed weather on june 18. it strengthened to tropical storm aletta the next day it continued intensifying and reached its peak intensity on june 20. vertical wind shear began to weaken the storm thereafter the weakening trend continued weakening aletta to a depression on june 21. the system dissipated june 23. alettas remnant low however could be tracked on satellite images for days following the storm the low finally dissipated north of Hawaii.14 aletta never affected land and no damage or casualties were reported.15  tropical storm

california peninsula the depression headed west-northwest gradually turned to the northwest and strengthened into tropical storm bud on june 27. early the next day bud peaked in intensity shear caused by a nearby upper level low slowly weakened bud later on june 28, a second center of circulation developed the two centers started a fujiwhara interaction the second center then became dominant and the first one vanished this confused structure is similar to what happened to 1993s tropical storm arlene this confused structure also weakened bud to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the same day the second center formed bud then headed westward over cool waters and dissipated on june 29.16 tropical storm bud spent its entire life over the open ocean far from land areas no casualties or damage was reported.17  hurricane carlottaedit  category 2hurricaneSSHWS  duration  june 28 july 5  peak intensity  105mph 967mbarhPa  the tropical depression that would be carlotta formed on june

miles southwest of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula developed a circulation and became tropical depression four-e convection increased and the depression strengthened into tropical storm daniel upper-level outflow improved and daniel peaked in intensity on july 9. daniel slowly declined as it continued westward it entered the central pacific on july 11. wind shear weakened daniel as it approached the big island and by july 15 had degenerated into an open wave.20  when daniel was approaching hawaii moderate surf of 4 to 6 feet to 1.8m impacted the south and southeast shores of the big island on july 13 and 14. daniels remnants also passed about 100 miles south of south point hawaii on july 15. that day they caused rainfall on windward slopes of the big island locally reaching 5 inches no reports of damage or casualties were received.21  hurricane emiliaedit  category 5hurricaneSSHWS  duration  july 16 july 25  peak intensity  160mph 926mbarhPa  main

moved west-northwest and strengthened into a hurricane.22 it entered the central pacific on july 17. it continued intensifying reaching Category5 intensity on july 19,8 the first Category5 pacific hurricane since ava emilia started weakening quickly on july 21. it weakened to a tropical storm on july 23 and dissipated two days later.8  emilia passed south of the hawaiian islands producing swells of 6 to 10 feet to 3.0m in height near the puna and ka coasts winds caused minor damage and rain was moderate.8 no one was killed.23  tropical storm fabioedit  tropical stormsshws  duration

tropical depression on july 21. it headed westward and out to sea strengthening into a tropical storm the next day gilma rapidly strengthened and became a hurricane exactly one day after it was named it continued to intensify as it entered the central pacific shortly after entering the central pacific gilma reached Category5 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the second of the season.26 it then suddenly weakened for unexplained reasons and weakened into a tropical storm on july 27. it became a depression three days after that and dissipated on july 31.8 hurricane gilma had minor impact on johnston atoll that atoll received light rain wind gusts to near gale force,27 and surf.8 no casualties or damage were reported.27  hurricane gilma was the second most-intense pacific at the time as of 2016, it remains the ninth-most intense gilma is also the strongest july storm in the eastern or central Pacific.1  hurricane liedit  category 1hurricaneSSHWS  duration  july 31 august 12 basin  peak intensity  75mph 1007mbarhPa  a tropical disturbance southwest of cabo san lucas organized into tropical depression eight-e on july 31.28 it headed west-northwest without strengthening much and crossed into the central pacific on august 2.29 eight-e developed a second center of circulation which became dominant,30 and then became bound up in the intertropical convergence zone.31 eight-e then became disorganized with multiple centers of circulation,32 and advisories were discontinued on august 5. the depressions remains continued their westward path well south of the hawaiian islands the depression regenerated on august 8. it soon strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Li,8 which is hawaiian for li approached the dateline on its generally westward heading just before crossing it intensified into a minimal Category1 hurricane it crossed the dateline on august 12 and became a storm in the 1994 pacific typhoon season.8 wind shear from a tropical upper-tropospheric trough weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed the dateline and the joint typhoon warning center downgraded li with its first advisory.34 li stayed a tropical storm until august 16, where it weakened into a tropical depression the system then began recurving and dissipated on august 18.35 a weakening tropical depression li caused showers on wake island other than there li had no impact on any land and no casualties or damage were reported.8  hurricane li is one of only seven tropical cyclones to exist on all three tropical cyclone basins in the pacific ocean it is also one of only six systems to form as a depression in the east pacific but be named in the central the others are lala iniki lana ela and Ulika.1  tropical storm hectoredit

became tropical storm hector quickly and as it paralleled the coast of mexico it began to weaken dissipating on august 10. no damage was reported anywhere.36  tropical storm hector was forecast to approach the baja california peninsula a tropical storm watch was issued for part of the peninsula on august 8. it was lifted later the same day.37 hectors most significant impact was rain the tropical storm dumped rain along a discontinuous zone of coastal and inland mexico the highest point maxima were 7.87 inches at cerro de ortegaixtlahua and 7.60 inches at CaduanoSantiago.38 no damage or casualties were reported.37  tropical depression one-cedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  august 9 august 14  peak intensity  35mph  an area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on august 9 while located 740 miles southeast of hilo hawaii the depression moved westward without organizing and dissipated on august 14.8  moisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of hawaii totaling to over 15 inches the flooding closed all major roads in hilo and was considered the worst flooding in 40years. the rainfall destroyed two homes and damaged 214, 14 severely it also damaged roads and businesses damage throughout the island totaled to 2017USD.39 flooding occurred in maui as well where landslides blocked portions of the hana Highway.40 one-cs point

that was part of the intertropical convergence zone developed several centers of circulation after it organized it separated from the itcz and became tropical depression eleven-e on august 10 while the system was about 690 miles south-southeast of the southern tip of the baja california Peninsula.41 it was upgraded to tropical storm ileana at the second advisory,42 at the same time as john the next storm.43 an eye appeared and ileana became a hurricane on august 12. it began weakening almost immediately thereafter as it passed over cooler waters and encountered increasing wind shear ileana was a tropical storm on august 13, and the next day it was a dissipating swirl low-level clouds located about 520 miles west of punta Eugenia.41 although ileana paralleled the coast of mexico watches and warnings were not issued because winds of tropical storm-force were not expected to affect land no one was killed and there was no damage reported in association with this cyclone.44  hurricane johnedit  category 5hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 11 september 10  peak intensity  175mph 929mbarhPa  main article hurricane john  tropical depression ten-e formed on august 11 south of mexico it headed generally westward and was upgraded into a tropical storm twelve hours after it formed and was named john john fluctuated in strength as it headed west always managing to stay at tropical storm strength on august 20, steady intensification began and john was a major hurricane when it entered the central pacific it continued westward reaching Category5 intensity on august 23. it passed around 245 miles south of hawaii and passed just north of johnston atoll on august 26.45 john stayed at hurricane intensity until it crossed the dateline on august 28, becoming a typhoon of the 1994 pacific typhoon season.8 after weakening into a tropical storm john recurved looped and recurved again.46 it reintensified and was a hurricane when it recrossed the dateline to reenter the central pacific john headed north-northeast until it went extratropical on september 10,8 thirty one days after it formed.1  ahead of the hurricane the 1100 people at johnston atoll evacuated on the atoll john caused 2017USD in damage no deaths were reported other than on johnston hurricane john had minor effects in hawaii its remnants also affected Alaska.8  hurricane john was the longest lasting and farthest traveling tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history.12 it is also one of six tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the pacific ocean an uncommon west-to-east dateline crosser and one of the few tropical cyclone to cross the dateline more than once.1  tropical depression twelve-eedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  august 12 august 15  peak intensity  35mph 1006mbarhPa  on august 14, an area of convection organized enough to be considered a tropical depression it was steered by johns circulation and it was never expected to strengthen much because it was close to cool waters.47 the cyclone drifted north then northeast north again northwest and then west.48 the national hurricane center declared the depression dissipated on august 15.49 the depression had no effects anywhere.48  hurricane kristyedit  category 2hurricaneSSHWS  duration  august 28 september 5  peak intensity  105mph 992mbarhPa  on august 28, tropical depression thirteen-e formed about 1,300 miles southwest of cabo san lucas mexico it was named tropical storm kristy on august 30. as it crossed into the central pacific a banding-type eye formed and it became a hurricane.50 twelve hours later it reached Category2 intensity kristy weakened steadily from that point due to wind shear it passed about 300 miles south of hawaii and dissipated on september 5.8 the lowest central pressure of kristy is unknown the last estimate was made when kirsty was still a tropical storm.1  as it approached the hawaiian islands a high surf advisory and a high wind warning were issued for the big island of hawaii no damage or deaths were reported in association with this system.51 its remnants crossed 180th meridian very early on september 7 and was absorbed by a tropical depression which became typhoon

depression five in the atlantic became tropical depression fourteen-e on september 3. it quickly became tropical storm lane a high pressure ridge centered itself north of lane keeping the storm on a westward track this brought lane into very favorable conditions and lane intensified when the tropical storm reached hurricane strength it entered a phase of rapid intensification reaching winds of about 135mph making it a category four hurricane the high pressure ridge shifted eastward and allowed lane to enter unfavorable conditions lane dissipated on september 10.52  tropical storm meleedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  september 6 september 9  peak intensity  40mph  a tropical disturbance became tropical depression two-c on september 6. it reached tropical storm strength the next day being named Mele.8 the name mele means in the hawaiian language and is also the hawaiian form of mele headed west-northwest and weakened back into a tropical depression on september it dissipated later that day without incident.8  tropical storm miriamedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  september 15 september 21  peak intensity  45mph 1002mbarhPa  miriam formed from a weak disturbance on september 15. it strengthened slightly into tropical storm miriam and dissipated on september 21, having led an uneventful life without impact in an interesting occurrence the low-level remnants of miriam were still visible for weeks after the storm dissipated near 140W.54  tropical storm normanedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  september 19 september 22  peak intensity  40mph 1004mbarhPa  a tropical depression formed on september 19, and became tropical storm norman the next day after tracking northwest it began to turn north in response to a trough and convection began to diminish norman dissipated on september 22 without having ever affected land.55  hurricane oliviaedit  category 4hurricaneSSHWS  duration  september 22 september 29  peak intensity  150mph 923mbarhPa  hurricane olivia ultimately formed from a disturbance that had separated from the intertropical convergence zone and become distinct by september 19. the disturbance slowly headed westward and it organized into a tropical depression on september 22 while located about 720 miles south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula the depression headed west-northwestwards and strengthened into tropical storm olivia on september 22. it steadily intensified and was a hurricane on september 24. it then rapidly strengthened into a powerful major hurricane it slowly curled to the northwest as it was observed by noaa research aircraft.56 olivia peaked in intensity on september 25. meanwhile a large cyclone off the extreme southern part of california induced a northward path as olivia started a small anticyclonic loop wind shear began to weaken the hurricane when olivia was finished the loop it had weakened to a tropical storm it then headed westward it weakened into a tropical depression on september 28 and dissipated the next day no impact was reported.57  at the time olivia was the third-most intense pacific hurricane on record it has since dropped to eleventh the storm also had the lowest barometric pressure of a category 4 pacific hurricane on record in 2001, hurricane juliette joined olivia as the most intense cat 4 on record in 2014, hurricane odile beat both storms when it attained a minimum pressure of 918mbars. olivia was also the most intense september hurricane since hurricane linda beat olivia olivia remains the third most intense september hurricane.1  tropical storm pauledit  tropical stormsshws  duration  september 24 september 30  peak intensity  45mph 1003mbarhPa  a nearly stationary cluster of thunderstorms and convection that had

rosa north and then northeast rosa intensified quickly peaking at Category2 intensity just before landfall near la concepcin on the morning of october 14. rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of mexico and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the united states spreading moisture.60  on october 12, a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from culiacn to manzanillo and the baja california peninsula south of latitude 24N. at the same time a tropical storm warning was issued from manzanillo to tepic on october 14, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast between culiacn and cabo corrientes jalisco and a tropical storm warning south of cabo corrientes to manzanillo all watches and warnings were lifted later that day.61  four deaths two in each of nayarit and durango were reported four people were missing in sinaloa all of the deaths were due to drowning more than 100,000people had their homes damaged in nayarit telephone poles and power lines were downed in sinaloa rain caused landslides and flash-flooding in mountainous areas.6 in jalisco mudslides forced the evacuation of 400 people from two coastal villages.62 the highest rainfall total in mexico was 14.09 inches at mesa de pedro Pablo.63 the moisture rosa sent into the united states was a contributing factor in record rains in parts of southeastern texas from october 15 to 19. those rains caused flooding that killed 22 people destroyed over 3000 homes and caused US700million in damage.64  tropical storm nonaedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  october 21 october 26  peak intensity
