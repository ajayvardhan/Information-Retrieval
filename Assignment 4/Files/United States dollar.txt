constitution provides that the congress has the power coin money.13 laws implementing this power are currently codified at 31 U.S.C.5112. section 5112 prescribes the forms in which the united states dollars should be issued.14 these coins are both designated in section 5112 as tender in payment of debts.14 the sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar the pure silver dollar is known as the american silver eagle section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins which have values ranging from one cent to 100 dollars.14 these other coins are more fully described in coins of the united states dollar  the constitution provides that regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.15 that provision of the constitution is made specific by section 331 of title 31 of the united states Code.16 the sums of money reported in the are currently being expressed in us dollars example see the 2009 financial report of the united states Government.17 the us dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the united states  the word is one of the words in the first paragraph of section 9 of article i of the constitution there is a reference to the spanish milled dollar a coin that had a monetary value of 8 spanish units of currency or reales in 1792 the us congress passed a coinage act section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins including or unitseach to be of the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver section 20 of the act provided the money of account of the united states shall be expressed in dollars or units and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the united states shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation in other words this act designated the united states dollar as the unit of currency of the united states  unlike the spanish milled dollar the us dollar is based upon a decimal system of values in addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar cent or one-hundredth of a dollar dime or one-tenth of a dollar and eagle or ten dollars with prescribed weights and composition of gold silver or copper for each it was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the half union exist however only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10, while and are largely unknown to the general public though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies and gasoline prices are usually in the form of per gallon eg more commonly written as when currently issued in circulating form denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as us coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as federal reserve notes the exception of gold silver and platinum coins valued up to as legal tender but worth far more as bullion both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today although the note form is significantly more common in the past money was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar currency and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of as the eagle discontinued in the 1930s. the term eagle was used in the coinage act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars and subsequently was used in naming gold coins paper currency less than one dollar in denomination known as currency was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as in 1854, james guthrie then secretary of the treasury proposed creating and gold coins which were referred to as a union and Union,18 thus implying a denomination of 1

small-sized notes introduced that year measure 6.14 by 2.61 by 0.0043 inches by 66.29 by 0.11mm. when the current smaller sized us currency was introduced it was referred to as philippine-sized currency because the philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency  etymologyedit  further information dollar  in the 16th century count hieronymus schlick of bohemia began minting coins known as joachimstalers german thal or nowadays usually tal cognate with in english named for joachimstal the valley where the silver was mined joachims valley now jchymov then part of the kingdom of bohemia now part of the czech Republic.19 joachimstaler was later shortened to the german taler a word that eventually found its way into danish and swedish as daler norwegian as dalar and daler dutch as daler or daalder ethiopian as hungarian as tallr italian as tallero and english as dollar.19 alternatively thaler is said to come from the german coin guldengroschen guilder being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder minted from the silver from joachimsthal  the coins minted at joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places one such example was a dutch coin depicting a lion hence its dutch name leeuwendaler english lion dollar  the leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 stuivers it was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation thus it was more advantageous for a dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade  the leeuwendaler was popular in the dutch east indies and in the dutch new netherland colony york and circulated throughout the thirteen colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries it was also popular throughout eastern europe where it led to the current romanian and moldovan currency being called leu  among the english-speaking community the coin came to be popularly known as lion dollar and is the origin of the name dollar.20 the modern american-english pronunciation of dollar is still remarkably close to the 17th-century dutch pronunciation of daler.21  by analogy with this lion dollar spanish pesos with the same weight and shape as the lion dollar came to be known as spanish dollars.21 by the mid-18th century the lion dollar had been replaced by the spanish dollar the famous of eight which was distributed widely in the spanish colonies in the new world and in the Philippines.22 eventually dollar became the name of the first official american currency  nicknamesedit  see also slang terms for money united states  the colloquialism like the british word pl for the pound sterling is often used to refer to dollars

originally applied specifically to the 19th century demand note dollars created by abraham lincoln to finance the costs of the civil war for the North.24 the original note was printed in black and

real or peso of 1768  the symbol usually written before the numerical amount is used for the us dollar well as for many other currencies the sign was the result of a late 18th-century evolution of the scribal abbreviation for the peso the common name for the spanish dollars that were in wide circulation in the new world from the 16th to the 19th centuries these spanish pesos or dollars were minted in spanish america namely in mexico city potos bolivia and lima peru the p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to  another popular explanation is that it is derived from the pillars of hercules on the spanish coat of arms of the spanish dollar these pillars of hercules on the silver spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an  yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters u and s written or printed one on top of the other this theory popularized by novelist ayn rand in atlas Shrugged,29 does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the united States.30  historyedit  see also history of the united states dollar  obverse of rare 1934 federal reserve note featuring a portrait of president william mckinley  reverse of a federal reserve note  the american dollar coin was initially based on the value and look of the spanish dollar used widely in spanish america from the 16th to the 19th centuries the first dollar coins issued by the united states mint 1792 were similar in size and composition to the spanish dollar minted in mexico and peru the spanish us silver dollars and later mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the united states and the spanish dollar and mexican peso remained legal tender until the coinage act of 1857. the coinage of various english colonies also circulated the lion dollar was popular in the dutch new netherland colony york but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the english colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable thus they were sometimes referred to as dollars.31  the us dollar was first defined by the coinage act of 1792, which specified a to be based in the spanish milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains of standard silver and an to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains of gold depending on purity.32 the choice of the value 371 grains arose from alexander hamiltons decision to base the new american unit on the average weight of a selection of worn spanish dollars hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains a new spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight and so the new us dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the spanish dollar  the same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars and the dollar at 110 eagle it called for 90 silver alloy coins in denominations of 1, 12, 14, 110, and 120 dollars it called for 90 gold alloy coins in denominations of 1, 12, 14, and 110 eagles the value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods this allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nations economy.33  the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents as is the custom now34 although today by law only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states currency.35 in fact the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency a practice compared to the policies of european monarchs.36 the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century before that side of coinage used profile faces and striding seated and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime and the dollar  for articles on the currencies of the colonies and states see connecticut pound delaware pound georgia pound maryland pound massachusetts pound new hampshire pound new jersey

continental currency  during the american revolution the thirteen colonies became independent states freed from british monetary regulations they each issued sd paper money to pay for military expenses the continental congress also began issuing currency denominated in spanish dollars the dollar was valued relative to the states currencies at the following rates  5 shillings georgia  6 shillings connecticut massachusetts new hampshire rhode island virginia  712 shillings delaware maryland new jersey pennsylvania  8 shillings new york north carolina  3212 shillings south carolina  continental currency depreciated badly during the war giving rise to the famous phrase worth a continental.37 a primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between congress and the states which continued to issue bills of credit additionally neither congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds.38 the currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar to 1000 continental dollars  silver and gold standardsedit  from 1792, when the mint act was passed the dollar was defined as 371.25 grains g of silver many historianswho erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver however there is no evidence of congress making this law this has to do with alexander hamiltons suggestion to congress of a fixed 151 ratio of silver to gold respectively the gold coins that were minted however were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the congressional standard of the silver dollar 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains in 1837 ratiocitation needed  in 1862, paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals due to the civil war silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated this disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the war of 1812. the use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the articles of confederation from 1777 to 1788. with no solid backing and being easily counterfeited the continentals quickly lost their value giving rise to the phrase worth a continental this was a primary reason for the state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts clause in article 1, section 10 of the united states constitution  in order to finance the war of 1812, congress authorized the issuance of treasury notes interest-bearing short-term debt that could be used to pay public dues while they were intended to serve as debt they did function a limited extent as money treasury notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the panic of 1837 and the panic of 1857, as well as to help finance the mexicanamerican war and the civil war  in addition to treasury notes in 1861, congress authorized the treasury to borrow million in the form of demand notes which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals however by december 1861, the union governments supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily the following february congress passed the legal tender act of 1862, issuing united states notes which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest but were legal tender meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs however silver and gold coins continued to be issued resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through greshams law in 1869, supreme court ruled in hepburn v griswold that congress could not require creditors to accept united states notes but overturned that ruling the next year in the legal tender cases in 1875, congress passed the specie payment resumption act requiring the treasury to allow us notes to be redeemed for gold after january 1, 1879. the treasury ceased to issue united states notes in 1971.  the gold standard act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains of gold equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters and the half dollar was reduced to 40 silver silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. gold coins were confiscated by executive order 6102 issued in 1933 by franklin roosevelt the gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at this standard persisted until 1968.  between 1968 and 1975, a variety of pegs to gold were put in place eventually culminating in a sudden end on august 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the nixon shock the last peg was per ouncecitation needed before the us dollar was let to freely float on currency markets  according to the bureau of engraving and printing the largest note it ever printed was the gold certificate series 1934. these notes were printed from december 18, 1934, through january 9, 1935, and were issued by the treasurer of the united states to federal reserve banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the treasury these notes were used for transactions between federal reserve banks and were

valuable today for their numismatic value and for gold and silver coins their precious metal value from 1965 to 1970 the kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel however since 1992, the us mint has produced special silver proof sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes quarters and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions in addition an experimental coin was also minted in 1879, but never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination  the coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the panama-pacific international exposition celebrating the opening of the panama canal only 1,128 were made 645 of which were octagonal this remains the only us coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest us coin ever produced  a gold coin was produced in high relief during 2015, although it was primarily produced for collectors not for general circulation.40  from 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny nickel dime quarter half dollar and dollar the nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged in its design from its original version every year since 1866, the nickel has been 75 copper and 25 nickel except for 4 years during world war ii when nickel was needed for the war  due to the pennys low value some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage.4142  collector coinsedit  the united states mint produces proof sets specifically for collectors and speculators silver proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime quarter and half dollar containing 90 silver starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the mint also produced proof sets containing the years commemorative coins alongside the regular coins another type of proof set is the presidential dollar proof set where four special coins are minted each year featuring a president because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on december 13, 2011, by us treasury secretary timothy f geithner future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors.43  2007 had

main article coins of the united states dollar  the first united states dollar was minted in 1794. known as the flowing hair dollar contained 416 grains of silver silver and 10.75 copper as specified by section 1344 of the coinage act of 1792. it was designated by section 9 of that act as having value of a spanish milled dollar  dollar coins have not been very popular in the united States.45 silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935 a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size featuring president dwight d eisenhower was minted from 1971 through 1978. gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century the susan b anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979 these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters due to their nearly equal size their milled edge and their similar color minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 pieces were struck in 1981, but as with all past us coins they remain legal tender as the number of anthony dollars held by the federal reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted additional anthony dollars were struck in 1999. in 2000, a new coin featuring sacagawea sacagawea dollar was introduced which corrected some of the problems of the anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the anthony dollar however this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing bill and is rarely used in daily transactions the failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.46  in february 2007, the us mint under the presidential coin act of 2005,47 introduced a new us presidential dollar coin based on the success of the state quarters series the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations starting with george washington on the obverse side the reverse side features the statue of liberty to allow for larger more detailed portraits the traditional inscriptions of pluribus unum god we trust the year of minting or issuance and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face this feature similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the british 1 coin is not usually associated with us coin designs the inscription has been eliminated with the statue of liberty serving as a sufficient replacement in addition due to the nature of us coins this will be the first time there will be circulating us coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse side jeffersonnickel franklin d rooseveltdime washingtonquarter kennedyhalf dollar and eisenhowerdollar another unusual fact about the new coin is grover cleveland will have two coins with two different portraits issued due to the fact he was the only us president to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.48  early releases of the washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the philadelphia mint to florida and tennessee banks highly sought after by collectors and trading for as much as each within a week of discovery the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions pluribus unum in god we trust 2007 p the mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly philadelphia although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying down lettering error coins.49 some cynics also erroneously point out that the federal reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years whereas coins are more permanent the fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones as most vending

to issue federal reserve notes those notes are of the united states and be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the treasury department of the united states in the city of washington district of columbia or at any federal reserve bank.51 federal reserve notes are designated by law as tender for the payment of debts.52 congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes including the united states Note53 and the federal reserve bank note the federal reserve note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s.  currently printed denominations are and notes above the denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. these notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime it was the latter usage that prompted president richard nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use with the advent of electronic banking they became less necessary notes in denominations of and were all produced at one time see large denomination bills in us currency for details with the exception of the bill was only issued as a series 1934 gold certificate and was never publicly circulated thus it is illegal to own these notes are now collectors items and are worth more than their face value to collectors  though still predominantly green post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations as a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note except the and the current version of the bill it also plans larger higher-contrast numerals more color differences and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period.54  means of issueedit  the monetary base consists of coins and federal reserve notes in circulation outside the federal reserve banks and the us treasury plus deposits held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks the adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400 billion dollars in 1994, to 800 billion in 2005, and over 3000 billion in 2013.55 the amount of cash in circulation is increased decreased by the actions of the federal reserve system eight times a year the 12-person federal open market committee meets to determine us monetary policy.56 every business day the federal reserve system engages in open market operations to carry out that monetary policy.57 if the federal reserve desires to increase the money supply it will buy securities as us treasury bonds anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars conversely it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars to take dollars out of circulation.58  when the federal reserve makes a purchase it credits the sellers reserve account the federal reserve this money is not transferred from any existing fundsit is at this point that the federal reserve has created new high-powered money commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the federal reserve to fulfill those requests the federal reserve places an order for printed money from the us treasury Department.59 the treasury department in turn sends these requests to the bureau of engraving and printing print new dollar bills and the bureau of the mint stamp the coins  usually the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target in other instances monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold for example in the case of the united states the federal reserve targets the federal funds rate the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight the other primary means of conducting monetary policy include discount window lending lender of last resort fractional deposit lending in the reserve requirement moral suasion certain market players to achieve specified outcomes mouth operations monetary policy

price index starting from 1913  the 6th paragraph of section 8 of article 1 of the us constitution provides that the us congress shall have the power to money and to the value of domestic and foreign coins congress exercised those powers when it enacted the coinage act of 1792. that act provided for the minting of the first us dollar and it declared that the us dollar shall have value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current.60  the table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that in a particular year could be purchased with the table shows that from 1774 through 2012 the us dollar has lost about 97.0 of its buying power.61  the decline in the value of the us dollar corresponds to price inflation which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.62 a consumer price index is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households the united states consumer price index published by the bureau of labor statistics is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the united States.63 it reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses.64 a graph showing the us cpi relative to 19821984 and the annual year-over-year change in cpi is shown at right  the value of the us dollar declined significantly during wartime especially during the american civil war world war i and world war II.65 the federal reserve which was established in 1913, was designed to furnish an currency subject to changes of quantity over short periods which differed significantly from previous forms of high-powered money such as gold national bank notes and silver coins.66 over the very long run the prior gold standard kept prices stablefor instance the price level and the value of the us dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s. the federal reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the us dollar and price stability reversing the inflation caused by the first world war and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30 deflation in us prices in the 1930s.67  under the bretton woods system established after world war ii the value of gold was fixed to per ounce and the value of the us dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold rising government spending in the 1960s, however led to doubts about the ability of the united states to maintain this convertibility gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the united states would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by president nixon resulting in the shock.68  the value of the us dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold and it fell upon the federal reserve to maintain the value of the us currency the federal reserve however continued to increase the money supply resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the us dollar in the 1970s. this was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked phillips curve and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign.68 between 1965 and 1981, the us dollar lost two thirds of its value.61  in 1979, president carter appointed paul volcker chairman of the federal reserve the federal reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s, and hence the value of the us dollar stabilized.68  over the thirty-year period from 1981 to 2009, the us dollar lost over half its value.61 this is because the federal reserve has targeted not zero inflation but a low stable rate of inflationbetween 1987 and 1997, the rate of inflation was approximately 3.5, and between 1997 and 2007 it was approximately 2. the so-called moderation of economic conditions since the 1970s is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability.69  there is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation would mean a constant value for the us dollar over time or low stable inflation would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time as is the case now although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the us dollar,67 others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.70  exchange ratesedit  historical exchange ratesedit  currency units per us dollar averaged over the year  19702  19802  19852  19902  1993  1999
