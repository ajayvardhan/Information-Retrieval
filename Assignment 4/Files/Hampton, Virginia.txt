of hampton virginia  in december 1606, three ships carrying men and boys left england on a mission sponsored by a proprietary company headed by captain christopher newport they sailed across the atlantic ocean to north america after a long voyage they first landed at the entrance to the chesapeake bay on the south shore at a place they named cape henry henry frederick prince of wales the elder son of their king  during the first few days of exploration they identified the site of old point comfort they originally named comfort as a strategic defensive location at the entrance to the body of water that became known as hampton roads this is formed by the confluence of the elizabeth nansemond and james rivers the latter is the longest river in virginia  weeks later on may 14, 1607, they established the first permanent english settlement in the present-day united states about 25 miles further inland from the bay which became the site of fortifications during the following 200 years  slightly south near the entrance to hampton river the colonists seized the native american community of kecoughtan under virginias governor sir thomas gates the colonists established their own small town with a small anglican church now as st johns episcopal church on july 9, 1610. this came to be known as part of hampton claims to be the oldest continuously occupied english settlement in the united States.9 hampton was named for henry wriothesley 3rd earl of southampton an important leader of the virginia company of london for whom the hampton river hampton roads and southampton county were also named the area became part of elizabeth cittie in 1619, elizabeth river shire in 1634, and was included in elizabeth city county when it was formed in 1643. by 1680, the settlement was known as hampton and it was incorporated as a town in 1705 and became the seat of elizabeth city county  in the latter part of august 1619, an english ship flying a dutch flag the white lion appeared off shore from point comfort its cargo included 20 plus africans captured from the slave ship sao joao bautista these were the first africans to come ashore on english-occupied land in what would become the united states john rolfe the widower of pocahontas wrote in a letter that he was at point comfort and witnessed the arrival of the first africans although these first bantu men from angola were considered indentured servants their arrival marked the beginning of slavery in north america two of the first africans to arrive at old point comfort in 1619 were antoney and isabella their child the first of african descent born in north america was born baptized january 1624.  shortly after the war of 1812, the us army built a more substantial stone facility at old point comfort it was called fort monroe in honor of president james monroe the new installation and adjacent fort calhoun a man-made island across the channel were completed in 1834.  fort monroe hampton and the surrounding area played several important roles during the american civil war although most of virginia became part of the confederate states of america fort monroe remained in union hands it became notable as a historic and symbolic site of early freedom for former slaves under the provisions of contraband policies and later the emancipation proclamation after the war former confederate president jefferson davis was imprisoned in the area now known as the casemate museum on the base  the ruins of hampton in 1862  to the south of fort monroe the town of hampton had the misfortune to be burned during both the american revolutionary war and the american civil war from the ruins of hampton left by evacuating confederates in 1861, slaves owned by confederates and under a degree of union protection built the grand contraband camp the first self-contained african american community in the united states a number of modern-day hampton streets retain their names from that community the large number of contrabands who sought the refuge of fort monroe and the grand contraband camp led to educational efforts which eventually included establishment of hampton university site of the famous emancipation oak  the original site of the native americans kecoughtan settlement was near the present site of a hampton roads transit facility.10 to the south of present-day hampton a small unrelated incorporated town also named kecoughtan many years later and also located in elizabeth city county was annexed by the city of newport news in 1927. it is now part of that citys east end  hampton was incorporated as a city in 1849.1 on march 30, 1908, hampton was separated from elizabeth city county and became an independent city.11 however it remained the county seat and continued to share many services with the county on july 1, 1952, following approval of voters of each locality by referendum the city of hampton the incorporated town of phoebus and elizabeth city county merged into the independent city of Hampton.11 it was the first of a series of political consolidations in the hampton roads region during the third quarter of the 20th century  fort monroeedit  fort monroe

aviation training research and development for nearly a hundred years from early prop planes and zeppelins to rocket parts and advanced fighters its proximity to norfolk means that hampton has long been home to many navy families together many air force and navy families in the hampton area experienced significant losses in war and peacetime due to family members in combat and peacetime military accidents  langley afb during the vietnam waredit  in particular during the vietnam war langley air force base was a designated base and thousands of air force families were transferred to hampton from all over the world to wait while their husbands and fathers served in vietnam thousands of navy families associated with naval bases in norfolk next door also waited in hampton during this era vietnam was a very high casualty war for air force and navy pilots types of planes experienced a 50 casualty rate and naval rats who fought on the rivers of the mekong delta experienced high casualties as well there accumulated over time in the hampton area a high concentration of families of unnaccounted for wartime casualties.13 in many cases hampton-stationed military families of in action or of war pilots and sailors spent many years in the area waiting to find out what had happened to their missing or captured airmen and sailors the service and in some cases sacrifice of these pilots airmen sailors and their families despite not having lifelong connections to the area are a poignant and inspiring part of hamptons history.1314  geographyedit  according to the united states
