august 16. the wave axis tracked steadily westward and on august 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low by august 27, the wave axis was located over cuba with the area of convection located between florida and the bahamas after tracking northwestward the disturbance crossed southern florida and after entering the gulf of mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development it tracked slowly westward at 5mph and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on august 29 while located about 230miles south-southwest of new orleans Louisiana.1  with a ridge of high pressure to its north the depression tracked westward favorable conditions persisted for several days prior to the arrival of the depression and as such the depression quickly intensified into tropical storm anita the storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm moist tropical air anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on august 301 this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967.2 initially it threatened to strike texas though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned anita to the west-southwest the hurricane developed a well-defined eye and hurricane anita began to rapidly intensify late on september 1 after attaining major hurricane status during a two-day period up to its peak intensity anita deepened at a rate of 2mbar per hour and on september 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175mph while located just offshore northeastern mexico making anita a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane Scale.1  hurricane anita maintained its strength as it approached land and at 1100UTC on september 2 it made landfall on soto la marina tamaulipas about 145miles south of brownsville texas or 80miles north of tampico mexico moving ashore with a pressure of 926mbar, anita was the third most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation and was the most intense hurricane to hit from the gulf of Mexico.23 it rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of mexico and on september 3, about 25hours after moving ashore anita emerged into the eastern pacific ocean as a tropical depression reclassified as tropical depression eleven the system continued to the west and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures the depression gradually lost its deep convection and on september 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the baja california Peninsula.4  preparationsedit  hurricane anita near its mexico landfall  shortly after first developing one oil company evacuated its oil rigs off of texas and louisiana by helicopter with several other companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers.5 ultimately 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms.1 the threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern louisiana the national hurricane center advised small craft along the northern gulf coast to remain at port.5 initially anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the texaslouisiana border as a result schools in cameron parish louisiana were closed,6 and on august 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern louisiana and northeastern texas coastlines after the track shifted further to the south the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between brownsville and just south of corpus christi Texas.1 an emergency shelter was opened in brownwood texas and army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations.7 an official from the national weather service recommended evacuation for all residents east of galveston texas living in an area below 5feet above sea level about 20,000 left cameron Louisiana.8 in all about 58,000people evacuated coastal locations in louisiana and Texas.1  though the national hurricane center did
