waterston  bookthermodynamics  v  t  e  in thermodynamics an isentropic process is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible.123456 the work transfers of the system are frictionless and there is no transfer of heat or matter such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes.7  the word is occasionally though not customarily interpreted in another way reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its etymology this is contrary to its original and customarily used definition in this occasional reading it means a process in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged for example because work done on the system includes friction internal to the system and heat is withdrawn from the system in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction so as to leave the entropy unchanged.8  contents  1 background  2 isentropic processes in thermodynamic systems  2.1 isentropic efficiencies of

and is the change in entropy the equal sign refers to a reversible process which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit never actually occurring in physical reality.910 for an isentropic process which by definition is reversible there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is adiabatic in an irreversible process of transfer of energy as work entropy is produced within the system consequently in order to maintain constant entropy within the system energy must be removed from the system as heat during the process  for reversible processes an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally the system from its surroundings temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process in which the system is thermally to a constant-temperature heat bath  isentropic processes in thermodynamic systemsedit  t-s vs temperature diagram of an isentropic process which is a vertical line segment  the entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic a process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process written or some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are pumps gas compressors turbines nozzles and diffusers  isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systemsedit  most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic processthe parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency.12  isentropic efficiency of turbines  isentropic efficiency of compressors  isentropic efficiency of nozzles  for all the above equations  is the specific enthalpy at the entrance state  is the specific enthalpy at the exit state for the actual process  is the specific enthalpy at the exit state for the isentropic process

cycle 1-2 isentropic compression in a compressor  note the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics real systems are not truly isentropic but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes  isentropic flowedit  in fluid dynamics an isentropic flow is a fluid flow that is both adiabatic and reversible that is no heat is added to the flow and no energy transformations occur due to friction or dissipative effects for an isentropic flow of a perfect gas several relations can be derived to define the pressure density and temperature along a streamline  note that energy can be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation as long as it doesnt happen as heat exchange an example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow  for an isentropic flow entropy density can vary between different streamlines if the entropy density is the same everywhere then the flow is said to be homentropic  derivation of the isentropic relationsedit  for a closed system the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added  the reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is  where is the pressure and is the volume the change in enthalpy is given by  then for a process that is both reversible and adiabatic no heat transfer occurs and so all reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic this leads to two important observations  and  next a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas for any transformation of an ideal gas it is always true that  and  using the general results derived above for and then  and   so for an ideal gas the heat capacity ratio can be written as  for an ideal gas is constant hence on integrating the above equation assuming a perfect gas we get  ie  using the equation of state for an ideal gas  proof  as nr constant itself so we can divide both sides by and still have constant term in the rhs  ultimate result  also for constant mole  and  thus
