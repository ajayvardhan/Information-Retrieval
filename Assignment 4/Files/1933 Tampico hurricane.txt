westward across the tropical atlantic ocean in mid-september on September16, it was estimated that a tropical depression developed about 185mi east-northeast of tobago it moved west-northwestward through the lesser antilles passing about 14mi south of grenada however the system was very weak and the island reported east winds of only 12mph after entering the caribbean sea the depression intensified into a tropical storm on September18, and a day later it became a hurricane on September20 it passed to the south of jamaica while quickly strengthening at 0000UTC on September21, a ship in the eye reported a barometric pressure of 929mbar ordinarily the pressure reading would suggest winds of 153mph however observations from the ship indicated the hurricane was smaller than normal with a radius of maximum winds of 8mi as a result the peak winds were estimated at 160mph or a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane Scale.3  after peaking in intensity the hurricane continued to the northwest early on September22, it passed about 50mi 2 south of cozumel before making landfall on the yucatn peninsula.34 its landfall intensity was unknown the atlantic hurricane reanalysis in 2012 suggested that the storm could have retained Category5 status until landfall although local observations did not validate the theory in the original analysis of the season the landfall intensity was estimated at 105mph as a compromise the 2012 reanalysis estimated the hurricane struck land with winds of 140mph the cyclone rapidly weakened while crossing the yucatn peninsula and on September23 it emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 65mph it quickly reintensified into a hurricane while moving toward the northeast mexican coastline at around 0000UTC on September25, the hurricane made its final landfall just south of tampico tamaulipas with winds of 110mph this was based on a ship in the eye reporting a pressure of 960mbar within 12hours, the storm dissipated over land.3  impactedit  while passing south of jamaica the hurricane produced high surf in Kingston.4 heavy rains from the storm affected much of the island which disrupted travel and caused one mudslide.5 in cozumel offshore the yucatn peninsula winds reached 76mph from the southeast.3 there the hurricane destroyed a fishing pier and several houses.6 while the storm crossed the peninsula progreso yucatn reported east winds of 55mph offshore progreso the storm capsized a boat killing one person.6  before the hurricane made its final landfall the threat of heavy rainfall prompted evacuations around Tampico,6 just 10days after another hurricane hit the same region.4 near tampico a ship reported winds of 81mph and a station in tampico recorded winds of 53mph high winds cut power lines and blew off or heavily damaged the roofs of half of the citys houses.78 a high accompanying storm surge washed away many people from their homes,79 and several barges were washed away.8 the harbor was filled with debris after the storm rendering it unusable.10 portions of the city were flooded up to 15ft deep.11 according to news reports the hurricane damaged about 75 of Tampico.7 majority of the damage was to poorly constructed houses,8 although a large hospital in tampico was also destroyed,12 killing 87people.13 roads were blocked throughout the city and the river was closed to boating.8 the rail line was impacted which disrupted relief supplies from reaching the region.10 outside of the city the hurricane increased levels along the pnuco and tames rivers,11 which remained above flood stage for several days.14 west of tampico the hurricane flooded the entire city of crdenas san luis potos killing 20 and injuring 200people.8 in pnuco veracruz about 5,000people were left homeless.10 in san luis potos state 30people were killed when a dam burst heavy rainfall in monterrey caused rivers to flood damage spread as far as the west coast of Mexico.12 throughout the country air travel was disrupted and several train lines were washed out,8 leaving three trains missing.12  initial news reports suggested a death toll of up to 5,000people, and the storm was considered greatest disaster in recent mexican history.7 two days after the storm dissipated the death toll was set at 54, with 850people injured and potentially thousands that were buried.10 search and rescue teams dug through the debris of the tampico to find survivors and victims.15 in 1997, the national hurricane center listed the death toll between 184200,16 and damage was estimated at  in the aftermath of the storm food and medical supplies rapidly diminished.10 after the storm dissipated doctors and nurses traveled to the city to assist in the aftermath while trains carried food and water.7 a train from monterrey to tampico carried food medicine and soldiers to assist in rebuilding but was delayed by ongoing flooding.14 military planes were utilized to transport aid.13 martial law was declared in tampico following the storm and officials imposed a 7 pm curfew uninjured citizens helped clear the roads president abelardo l rodrguez asked the governors of the mexican states to send aid and for residents
