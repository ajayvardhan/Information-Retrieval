war had begun delegates from some unionist counties of northwestern virginia decided to break away from virginia although they included many secessionist counties in the new state.12 west virginia was admitted to the union on june 20, 1863, and was a key border state during the war west virginia was the only state to form by separating from a confederate state the first to separate from any state

mound builder cultures survive especially in the areas of present-day moundsville south charleston and romney the artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of village societies they had a tribal trade system culture that crafted cold-worked copper pieces  in the 1670s during the beaver wars the powerful iroquois five allied nations based in present-day new york and pennsylvania drove out other american indian tribes from the region in order to reserve the upper ohio valley as a hunting ground siouan language tribes such as the moneton had previously been recorded in the area  a century later the area now identified as west virginia was contested territory among anglo-americans as well with the colonies of pennsylvania and virginia claiming territorial rights under their colonial charters to this area before the american revolutionary war some speculative land companies such as the vandalia Company,14 and later the ohio company and indiana company tried to legitimize their claims to land in parts of west virginia and kentucky but failed with the federal settlement of the pennsylvania and virginia border dispute which resulted in the creation of kentucky kentuckians satisfied and the inhabitants of a large part of west virginia were grateful.15  the crown considered the area of west virginia to be part of the british virginia colony from 1607 to 1776. the united states considered this area to be the western part of the state of virginia was commonly referred as trans-allegheny virginia from 1776 to 1863, before the formation of west virginia its residents were discontented for years with their position in virginia as the government was dominated by the planter elite of the tidewater and piedmont areas the legislature had electoral malapportionment based on the counting of slaves toward regional populations and the western white residents were underrepresented in the state legislature more subsistence and yeoman farmers lived in the west and they were generally less supportive of slavery although many counties were divided on their support the residents of this area became more sharply divided after the planter elite of eastern virginia voted to secede from the union during the civil war  residents of the western and northern counties set up a separate government under francis pierpont in 1861, which they called the restored government most voted to separate from virginia and the new state was admitted to the union in 1863. in 1864 a state constitutional convention drafted a constitution which was ratified by the legislature without putting it to popular vote west virginia abolished slavery by a gradual process and temporarily disenfranchised men who had held confederate office or fought for the confederacy  west virginias history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain numerous and vast river valleys and rich natural resources these were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles

knights of the golden horseshoe expedition which the states golden horseshoe competition for 8th graders was named had penetrated as far as pendleton county however modern historians interpret the original accounts of the excursion as suggesting that none of the expeditions horsemen ventured much farther west of the blue ridge mountains than harrisonburg virginia john van metre an indian trader penetrated into the northern portion in 1725. the same year german settlers from pennsylvania founded new mecklenburg the present shepherdstown on the potomac river and others followed  king charles ii of england in 1661, granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the potomac and rappahannock rivers known as the northern neck thomas fairfax 6th lord fairfax of cameron ultimately took possession of this grant and in 1746, a stone was erected at the source of the north branch potomac river to mark the western limit of his grant a considerable part of this land was surveyed by the young george washington between 1748 and 1751. the diary kept by washington recorded that there were already many squatters largely of german origin along the south branch potomac river  christopher gist a surveyor in the employ of the first ohio company which was composed chiefly of virginians explored the country along the ohio river north of the mouth of the kanawha river between 1751 and 1752. the company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, though they were hindered by native american resistance few native americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state but the region was a common hunting ground crossed by many trails during the french and indian war north american front of the seven years war in europe indian allies of the french nearly destroyed the scattered british settlements  shortly before the american revolutionary war in 1774 the crown governor of virginia john murray 4th earl of dunmore led a force over the mountains a body of militia under then-colonel andrew lewis dealt the shawnee indians under hokoleskwa a crushing blow during the battle of point pleasant at the

the shawnee had returned to war joining the chickamauga a band of cherokee known for the area where they lived native american attacks on settlers continued until after the american revolutionary war during the war the settlers in western virginia were generally active whigs and many served in the continental army however claypools rebellion of 17801781, in which a group of men refused to pay taxes imposed by the continental army showed war-weariness in what became west virginia  trans-allegheny virginiaedit  see also history of slavery in west virginia  for more details on this topic see virginia  a celebration at a slave wedding in virginia 1838  social conditions in western virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state the population was not homogeneous as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of pennsylvania and included germans protestant scotch-irish and settlers from the states farther north counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east virginians during the american revolution the movement to create a state beyond the alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of was presented to congress on the grounds that the mountains presented an almost impassable barrier to the east the rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable and time only increased the social political economic and cultural differences tuckahoe-cohee between the two sections of virginiacitation needed  a convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for virginia against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains required a property qualification for suffrage this effectively disenfranchised some of the poorer yeoman farmers in addition it gave the slave-holding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the states representation in the us house of representatives as a result every county beyond the alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution which nevertheless passed because of eastern support the eastern planter elite dominated the legislature and saw to their own interestscitation needed  the virginia constitutional convention of 185051, the reform convention addressed a number of issues important to western virginians it extended the vote to all white males 21 years or older the governor lieutenant-governor the judiciary sheriffs and other county officers were to be elected by public vote the composition of the general assembly was changed representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the basis of the census of 1850, counting whites only the senate representation was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats with the west receiving twenty and the east thirty senators this was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the general assembly to reapportion representation on the basis of white population in 1865, or else put the matter to a public referendum but the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value except for slaves slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only a fraction of their true value small farmers however had all their assets animals and land taxed at full value despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new constitution most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties who did not like the compromises made for the west.19  given these differences many in the west had long contemplated a separate state in particular men such as lawyer francis h pierpont from fairmont had long chafed under the political domination of the tidewater and piedmont slave-holders in addition to differences over the abolition of slavery he and allies felt the virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west such as turnpikes and railroads.20  separation from virginiaedit  see also state of kanawha and west virginia in the american civil war  francis h pierpont a leader during the second wheeling convention  on october 24, 1861, when voters from 41 counties voted to form a new state voter turnout was 34. the name was subsequently changed from kanawha to west Virginia.21  abraham lincoln walks at midnight a statue on the grounds of the west virginia state capitol  harpers ferry it appeared in 2005 changed hands a dozen times during the american civil war and was annexed by west virginia  statehood vote of october 24, 1861  west virginia was the only state in the union to separate from a confederate state during the american civil War.22 in richmond on april 17, 1861, the virginia secession convention of 1861 voted to secede from the union but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner ultimately became west virginia only voted 17 in favor of the ordinance of secession and 30 voted against,23 with 2 abstentions.24 almost immediately after that vote a mass meeting at clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in wheeling on may 13, 1861. when this first wheeling convention met 425 delegates from 25 counties were present though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area,25 but soon there was a division of sentiment  some delegates led by john s carlile favored the immediate formation of a new state while others led by waitman willey argued that as virginias secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum happened on may 23, such action would constitute revolution against the united States.26 the convention decided that if virginians adopted the secession ordinance which there was little doubt another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in wheeling in june 1861. on may 23, 1861, secession was ratified by a large majority in virginia as a whole but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the Ordinance.27  the second wheeling convention met as agreed on june 11 and declared that since the secession convention had been called without popular consent all its acts were void and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices the wheeling conventions and the delegates themselves were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia.28 of its 103 members 33 had been elected to the virginia general Assembly29 on may 23. this included some hold-over state senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and some who vacated their offices to convene in wheeling other members chosen even more irregularlysome in mass meetings others by county committee and still others were seemingly self-appointed30 an act for the reorganization of the government was passed on june 19. the next day convention delegates chose francis h pierpont as governor of virginia and elected other officers to a rival state government and two us senators and carlile to replace secessionists before adjourning the federal government in washington dc promptly recognized the new government and seated the two new senators thus there were two state governments in virginia one pledging allegiance to the united states and one to the confederacy  the second wheeling convention had recessed until august 6, then reassembled on august 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable at the october 24, 1861 election 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against the election results were questioned since the union army then occupied the area and union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent confederate sympathizers from voting.31 this was also election day for local offices and elections were also held in camps of confederate soldiers who elected rival state officials such as robert e cowan most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the northern panhandle.32 over 50,000 votes had been cast on the ordinance of secession yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19,000.33 in ohio county home to wheeling only about one-quarter of the registered voters cast votes.34 in most of what would become west virginia there was no vote at all since as two-thirds of the territory of west virginia had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to richmond votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.35  despite that controversy delegates many methodist ministers met to write a new constitution for the new state beginning on november 26, 1861. during that constitutional convention a mr lamb of ohio county and a mr carskadon claimed that in hampshire county out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state the rest were cast illegally by union soldiers.36 one of the key figures was rev gordon battelle who also represented ohio county and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools as well as to limit movement of slaves into the new state and to gradually abolish slavery the education proposal succeeded but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on february 18, 1862. the new constitution was more closely modeled on that of ohio than of virginia adopting a township model of government rather than the cliques of virginia which carlile criticized and a compromise demanded by the kanawha region lawyers benjamin smith and brown allowed counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railroads or other improvement organizations.37 the resulting instrument was ratified for and 514 against on april 11, 1862.  on may 13, 1862 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state an application for admission to the union was made to congress introduced by senator waitman willey of the restored government of virginia however sen carlile sought to sabotage the bill first trying to expand the new states boundaries to include the shenandoah valley and then to defeat the willey amendment at home.38 on december 31, 1862, an enabling act was approved by president abraham lincoln admitting west virginia on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution rev battelle had urged in the wheeling intelligencer and also written to lincoln while many felt that west virginias admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional lincoln issued his opinion on the admission of west virginia finding that body which consents to the admission of west virginia is the legislature of virginia and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient.39  the convention was reconvened on february 12, 1863, and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met the revised constitution was adopted on march 26, 1863 and on april 20, 1863, president lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on june 20, 1863. meanwhile officers for the new state were chosen while gov pierpont moved his pro-union virginia capital to union-occupied alexandria where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all of the remaining virginia counties within the federal lines  the question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the supreme court of the united states in the following manner berkeley and jefferson counties lying on the potomac east of the mountains in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized government of virginia voted in favor of annexation to west virginia  many voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the confederate army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer when they returned the virginia general assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866, brought suit against west virginia asking the court to declare the counties a part of virginia which would have declared west virginias admission as a state unconstitutional meanwhile on march 10, 1866, congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer the supreme court decided in favor of west virginia in 1870.40  during the civil war union general george b mcclellans forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating at the battle of rich mountain and union control was never again seriously threatened despite an attempt by robert e lee in the same year in 1863, general john d imboden with 5,000 confederates raided a considerable portion of the state and burned pierponts library although senator willey escaped their grasp bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended the eastern panhandle counties were more affected by the war with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands  the area that became west virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and confederate armies,41 approximately 22,00025,000 each in 1865, the wheeling government found it necessary to strip voting rights from returning confederates in order to retain control james ferguson who proposed the law said that if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes.42 the property of confederates might also be confiscated and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the confederacy was adopted the addition of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the united states constitution caused a reaction the democratic party secured control in 1870, and in 1871, the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated the first steps toward this change had been taken however by the republicans in 1870. on august 22, 1872, an entirely new constitution was adopted  beginning in reconstruction and for several decades thereafter the two states disputed the new states share of the pre-war virginia governments debts which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements such as canals roads and railroads under the virginia board of public works virginiansled by former confederate general william mahoneformed a political coalition based upon this the readjuster party although west virginias first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the virginia debt negotiations opened by virginia in 1870 were fruitless and in 1871, virginia funded two-thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to west virginia the issue was finally settled in 1915, when the supreme court of the united states ruled that west virginia owed

than any other single economic activity  saltpeter caves had been employed throughout appalachia for munitions the border between west virginia and virginia includes the trail a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were rendered and sold to the government the trail stretched from pendleton county to the western terminus of the route in the town of union monroe county nearly half of these caves are on the west virginia side including organ cave and haynes cave in the late 18th-century, saltpeter miners in haynes cave found large animal bones in the deposits these were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier colonel john stuart to thomas jefferson the bones were named megalonyx jeffersonii or great-claw and became known as jeffersons three-toed sloth it was declared the official state fossil of west virginia in 2008. the west virginia official state rock is bituminous coal,44 and the official state gemstone is silicified mississippian fossil lithostrotionella coral.45  the limestone also produced a useful quarry industry usually small and softer high-calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime this lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes for many years a specific portion of the c o railroad carried limestone rock to clifton forge virginia as an industrial flux  salt mining had been underway since the 18th century though it had largely played out by the time of the american civil war when the red salt of kanawha county was a valued commodity of first confederate and later union forces in years following more sophisticated mining methods would restore west virginias role as a major producer of salt  however in the second half of the 19th century there was an even greater treasure not yet developed bituminous coal it would fuel much of the industrial revolution in the us and the steamships of many of the worlds navies  the residents native americans and early european settlers had long known of the underlying coal and that it could be used for heating and fuel however for a long time very small mines were the only practical development after the war with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding us and export markets as the anthracite mines of northwestern new jersey and pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period investors and industrialists focused new interest in west virginia geologists such as dr david t ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining

virginias southern tier from norfolk had sights clearly set on the mountain state where the owners had large land holdings their railroad was renamed norfolk and western and a new railroad city was developed at roanoke to handle planned expansion after its new president frederick j kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam which kimballs wife named pocahontas the nw redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it soon the nw was also shipping from new coal piers at hampton roads  in 1889, in the southern part of the state along the norfolk and western rail lines the important coal center of bluefield west virginia was founded the of the pocahontas coalfield this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades it shares a sister city with the same name bluefield in virginia  in the northern portion of the state and elsewhere the older baltimore and ohio railroad and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities the bo developed coal piers in baltimore and at several points on the great lakes other significant rail carriers of coal were the western

although the deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme in secret collusion each declined to negotiate favorable rates with page nor did they offer to purchase his railroad as they had many other short-lines however if the co and nw presidents thought they could thus kill the page project
