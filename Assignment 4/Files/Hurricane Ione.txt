one of the first tropical cyclone forecast models was developed ione was chosen as one of the candidates to test out its reliability the errors associated with ione were significant as the model did not forecast ione to make landfall in north carolina forcing the storm eastward to the south of the state.16  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  hurricane bonnie  list of atlantic hurricanes
