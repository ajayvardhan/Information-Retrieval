all but two of their planned tasks swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the stations hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in kaleris spacesuit kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuits visor.11 the spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes the excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for kaleri  honours and awardsedit  hero of the russian federation august 1992 for
