 yucatn peninsula  us gulf coast the florida panhandle  ohio river valley  ontario  part of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane opal was a Category4 hurricane that caused severe damage along the northern gulf coast of the united states in october 1995. opal was the ninth hurricane and the strongest of the abnormally active 1995 atlantic hurricane season it crossed the yucatn peninsula while still a tropical depression on september 27, then strengthened and moved northward in the gulf becoming the most powerful category 4 atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall october 4 in the florida panhandle near pensacola as a 115-mph hurricane opal devastated the pensacolapanhandle area with a 15-ft storm surge and traveled up the entire state of alabama becoming a tropical storm in tennessee opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-atlantic states before dissipating  throughout the storms path from central america into the ohio valley 63 people died in storm-related events losses attributed to opal exceeded much of which took place in the united states the name was retired in 1996, replaced by for the 2001 season  contents  1 meteorological history  2

storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of hurricane opal were linked using satellite imagery and synoptic analyses to a tropical wave that left the western coast of africa on September11.1 ten days later the disturbance had crossed the central atlantic and had reached the lesser Antilles.2 continuing to track westward the disturbance showed little signs of organization before entering the western caribbean sea on September23. there the wave became entangled with a broad area of low-pressure east of nicaragua and the combined system drifted west-northwestward toward the yucatn peninsula even then the disturbance lacked any significant development however a burst of thunderstorm activity occurred near the storms center on September27, prompting the national hurricane centernhc to declare the system a tropical depression at 1800UTC that day at the time the depression was centered 80mi south-southeast of cozumel Mexico.1  the primordial depression meandered across the yucatn peninsula during the three days following tropical cyclogenesis due to the lack of dominant steering currents despite remaining over land for an extended period the depression developed organized rainbands and ships in the region reported weather conditions that were suggestive of a stronger system as a result the nhc upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity at 1200UTC on September30 while the storm was over the north-central coast of yucatn this classification resulted in the tropical cyclone being named opal which also made it the first atlantic storm to be given a name starting with the letter O.3 over the next two days opal would enter the gulf of mexico and track slowly west-southwestward into the bay of campeche there the storm strengthened into a hurricane at 1200UTC on October2. shortly afterward a primitive eye began to form at the same time a strong trough tracking across the united states caused opal to slowly turn northeastward.1  after clearing the bay of campeche opal accelerated towards the united states gulf coast the combination of warm sea surface temperatures associated with an unusually warm pocket of warm ocean waters and an upper-level high pressure area over the gulf of mexico resulted in a highly conductive environment for intensification.14 after a significant reorganization in opals internal structure the hurricane was able to rapidly intensify in these favorable conditions at 1200UTC on October4, opal reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 916 hpa making it a Category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale the tropical cyclones eye measured 12mi at peak intensity as the storm was beginning an eyewall replacement cycle the progression of this cycle resulted in opals gradual weakening thereafter at 2200UTC that day opal made landfall between pensacola beach florida and cape san blas as a Category3 hurricane with winds of 115mph weakening quickened as opal moved further inland degenerating into a tropical depression over tennessee less than a day after landfall the diffusing cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards these extratropical remnants tracked towards the northeast before they were last noted along the northern coast of lake ontario in Quebec.1  preparationsedit  hurricane opal near peak intensity on October4  although opal was a weak system located over the yucatn peninsula at the time 350people evacuated from grand isle louisiana on September28 after rough surf associated with the distant cyclone began to threaten louisiana highway 1the only thoroughfare connecting grand isle with the louisianan mainland.5 the following day oil companies operating offshore oil drilling platforms in the gulf of mexico began evacuating workers from the rigs to land.6 on October1, a coastal flood watch was issued for portions of the united states coast due to the risk of storm surge from opal the united states coast guard issued an advisory for boaters in the gulf of mexico to use caution or remain in port where possible the next day the galveston texas emergency operations center opened to monitor the tropical cyclone and deliberate upon potential preparations for the city.7 meanwhile the launch space shuttle columbias STS-73 mission set for October5 was postponed due to opals anticipated effects.8  on october 3, a voluntary evacuation order was placed on plaquemines parish louisiana due to the risks of potential storm surge schools were also closed by noon that day across the parish.9 voluntary evacuation orders for the florida panhandle which would ultimately be the most heavily affected area also began the same day with several counties giving evacuation orders farther west a mandatory evacuation order was placed on mobile county alabama by then-governor fob james just before noon october 4 with the hurricane near landfall escambia okaloosa and santa rosa counties halted evacuations instead ordering those still within vulnerable areas to seek shelter instead however the large amount of evacuees led to severe traffic congestion escambia county officials estimated that of thousands were still on evacuation routes within the county only a few hours before opal made landfall mass evacuations in some other counties concluded during the afternoon of october 4, though many evacuees in other locations were unable to reach safe areas prior to the onset of gale-force winds.10  an estimated 100,000people evacuated from the united states gulf coast ahead of opal with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and over half of evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties in their post-storm assessment the federal emergency management agencyfema noted that the landfalls of hurricane allison and hurricane erin on the florida panhandle earlier in the year produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for hurricane opalsome people may have taken a and see approach that resulted in complacency while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane regardless the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic and the failure to clear hurricane evacuation routes of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for opal traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while raising fears that stranded evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force winds.10  the post-landfall watches and warnings released in accordance with opal were a flash flood warning released on october 5 for portions of alabama northern georgia and the western parts of north carolina and south Carolina.11 the warning also included eastern tennessee a flash flood watch was also in effect for portions of the upper ohio valley the mid-atlantic region the central appalachians and the lower great lakes wind warnings were in effect for northwestern south carolina all the way to western new York.11 a gale watch was also in effect for lake erie lake ontario and the southern sections of the st lawrence seaway  six hours later the gale warnings over lake erie lake ontario and the southern sections of the st lawrence seaway were upgraded into a storm warning for erie alone the gale warning for the other two sections remained the shoreline of lake erie was under a beach erosion warning from buffalo new york to ripley new York.12 the storm prediction center released a tornado watch for northern and central new jersey and portions of new york and connecticut on october 6.13  significant non-surge areas of escambia county florida south of us 98 were included in evacuation areas because of the potential for isolation by flooding.14  tropical cyclone watches and

about 20 percent of its annual rainfall in four days.16 across campeche and tabasco more than 42,000 people were forced to evacuate as rivers overtopped their banks.17 according to notimex an estimated 100,000 people evacuated due to the storm.18 by October1, an estimated 500,000acres of crops had been destroyed by the floods.17 in san francisco de campeche flood waters reached a depth of 6ft governor jorge salomon ordered the closure of all government offices businesses and schools by October2 in light of the extensive flooding.19 at least 60towns across the state were isolated by flooding by october 3, agricultural losses in campeche alone were estimated in the billions of pesos of millions of dollars.20 at least 19 people perished across mexico while another 31 were killed in Guatemala.15  floridaedit  about 200 miles of floridas coastline felt effects from hurricane Opal.21  rainfalls in florida peaked at 15.45 inches in ellyson 7.27 inches at pensacola and 6.64 inches at hurlburt field the highest gust recorded was a 145mph gust at hurlburt field lower gusts were 115 miles per hour at eglin air force base and an 88mph gust at pensacola pns the highest sustained winds were 84mph at hurlburt field and 80mph at eglin air force base the two reported storm surges were 5 feet to 6 feet above normal at apalachicola and 2 feet to 4 feet above normal at Sarasota.1 opal brought heavy surge to the area 8 feet to 15 feet in some areas comparing itself to hurricane eloise which struck the same area at near equal strength in 1975.  damage from hurricane opal  opal caused about US5.1billion in damage making it the third costliest hurricane at the time most of the structural damage occurred near the coastline on the florida panhandle due to intense surge amazingly enough nearly a mile of us highway 98 near eglin air force base was completely destroyed the pavement was nearly replaced by mounds of sand left behind after storm surge.22 opal also spawned an F2 tornado that killed a young woman in florida none died as a direct result of storm surge this is quite unusual considering the strength and landfall location of opal okaloosa island fort walton beach was overwhelmed by storm surge numerous homes were under 3 feet to 10 feet of water residents were not allowed to return to the island until the homes could be secured a humver tour was arranged by the national guard so home owners could see the damage but the homeowners were not allowed off the bus sand dunes along the stretch of us 98, normally 25 feet high were removed by wind and surge where once the ocean was obscured from view by the dunes for miles a flat open space opened up along us highway 98.  us gulf coastedit  the peak rainfall from opal in alabama was 19.42 inches 3 miles

persons in public shelters occurred in plaquemines parish where 1,600people were placed in public shelters.26 although no direct injuries occurred from the hurricane an indirect injury is attributed to the hurricane in a freak accident a jefferson parish employee was injured while attempting to lower a large flag on october 4. the employee who was holding onto a rope attached a flag was tossed

a debris flow in the poplar cove area of macon County.36 a flash flood from rainfall amounts typically ranged from four to six inches and closed roads and bridges were the result the most serious flooding apparently occurred in avery county where evacuations were required and tanks of propane were found floating in the banner elk River.37  three deaths also occurred in the state a man in
