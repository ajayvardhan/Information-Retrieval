e  a season is a division of the year1 marked by changes in weather ecology and amount of daylight seasons result from earths orbit around the sun and earths axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane.23 in temperate and polar regions the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the earths surface variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate and plants to be dormant  red and green trees in autumn  during may june and july the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun the same is true of the southern hemisphere in november december and january it is earths axial tilt that causes the sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux however due to seasonal lag june july and august are the warmest months in the northern hemisphere while december january and february are the warmest months in the southern hemisphere  in temperate and subpolar regions four calendar-based seasons are generally recognized spring summer autumn or fall and winter ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions prevernal vernal estival serotinal autumnal and hibernal many tropical regions have two seasons the rainy wet or monsoon season and the dry season some have a third cool mild or harmattan season seasons often held special significance for agrarian societies whose lives revolved around planting and harvest times and the change of seasons was often attended by ritual  a deciduous tree in winter  the six ecological

effectsedit  illumination of the earth at each change of astronomical season  fig 1  this diagram shows how the tilt of the earths axis aligns with incoming sunlight around the winter solstice of the northern hemisphere regardless of the time of day the earths rotation on its axis the north pole will be dark and the south pole will be illuminated see also arctic winter in addition to the density of incident light the dissipation of light in the atmosphere is greater when it falls at a shallow angle  main article effect of sun angle on climate  axis tiltedit  the seasons result from the earths axis of rotation being tilted with respect to its orbital plane by an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees.4 tilt is also known as of the ecliptic  regardless of the time of year the northern and southern hemispheres always experience opposite seasons this is because during summer or winter one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun fig 1 than the other and this exposure alternates as the earth revolves in its orbit for approximately half of the year around march 20 to around september 22, the northern hemisphere tips toward the sun with the maximum amount occurring on about june 21. for the other half of the year the same happens but in the southern hemisphere instead of the northern with the maximum around december 21. the two instants when the sun is directly overhead at the equator are the equinoxes also at that moment both the north pole and the south pole of the earth are just on the terminator and hence day and night are equally divided between the northern and southern hemispheres around the march equinox the northern hemisphere will be experiencing spring as the hours of daylight increase and the southern hemisphere is experiencing autumn as daylight hours shorten  the effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in day length and altitude of the sun at noon culmination of the sun during a year the low angle of sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are spread over a larger area of the earths surface so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity between this effect and the shorter daylight hours the axial tilt of the earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres  a deciduous tree in winter  illumination of earth by sun at the

the south far left northern solstice  play media  animation of earth as seen daily from the sun looking at UTC0200, showing the solstice and changing seasons  two images showing the amount of reflected sunlight at southern and northern summer solstices respectively m  elliptical earth orbitedit  compared to axial tilt other factors contribute little to seasonal temperature changes the seasons are not the result of the variation in earths distance to the sun because of its elliptical orbit.5 in fact earth reaches perihelion point in its orbit closest to the sun in january and it reaches aphelion point from the sun in july so the slight contribution of orbital eccentricity opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the northern hemisphere.6 in general the effect of orbital eccentricity on earths seasons is a 7 variation in sunlight received  a tree in summer  orbital eccentricity can influence temperatures but on earth this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors research shows that the earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun this is because the northern hemisphere has more land than the southern and land warms more readily than sea.6 any noticeable intensification of the southern hemispheres winters and summers due to earths elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the southern hemisphere.7  maritime and hemisphericedit  seasonal weather fluctuations also depend on factors such as proximity to oceans or other large bodies of water currents in those oceans el nioenso and other oceanic cycles and prevailing winds  a deciduous tree in autumn  in the temperate and polar regions seasons are marked by changes in the amount of sunlight which in turn often causes cycles of dormancy in plants and hibernation in animals these effects vary with latitude and with proximity to bodies of water for example the south pole is in the middle of the continent of antarctica and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans the north pole is in the arctic ocean and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water the result is that the south pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the north pole during the northern winter  the cycle of seasons in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that in the other when it is summer in the northern hemisphere it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa  tropicsedit  in tropical and subtropical regions there is little annual fluctuation of sunlight however there are seasonal shifts of a rainy global-scale low pressure belt called the intertropical convergence zone as a result the amount of precipitation tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature when the convergence zone is north of the equator the tropical areas of the northern hemisphere experience their wet season while the tropics south of the equator have their dry season this pattern reverses when the convergence zone migrates to a position south of the equator  mid-latitude thermal lagedit  in meteorological terms the summer solstice and winter solstice the maximum and minimum insolation respectively do not fall in the middles of summer and winter the heights of these seasons occur up to seven weeks later because of seasonal lag seasons though are not always defined in meteorological terms  in astronomical reckoning by hours of daylight alone the solstices and equinoxes are in the middle of the respective seasons because of seasonal lag due to thermal absorption and release by the oceans regions with a continental climate which predominate in the northern hemisphere often consider these four dates to be the start of the seasons as in the diagram with the cross-quarter days considered seasonal midpoints the length of these seasons is not uniform because of the elliptical orbit of the earth and its different speeds along that orbit.8  four-season calendar reckoningedit  calendar-based reckoning defines the seasons in absolute rather than relative terms accordingly if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer additionally the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another most calendar-based methods use a four-season model to identify the warmest and coldest seasons which are separated by two intermediate seasons  a deciduous tree in autumn  meteorologicaledit  animation of seasonal differences especially snow cover through the year  meteorological seasons are reckoned by temperature with summer being the hottest quarter of the year and winter the coldest quarter of the year in 1780 the societas meteorologica palatina became defunct in 1795, an early international organization for meteorology defined seasons as groupings of three whole months as identified by the gregorian calendar ever since professional meteorologists all over the world have used this definition.9 therefore for temperate areas in the northern hemisphere spring begins on 1 march summer on 1 june autumn on 1 september and winter on 1 december for the southern hemisphere temperate zone spring begins on 1 september summer on 1 december autumn on 1 march and winter on 1 June.1011 in australasia the meteorological terms for seasons apply to the temperate zone that occupies all of new zealand new south wales victoria tasmania the south-eastern corner of south australia and the south-west of western australia and the south east queensland areas south of brisbane  australasian seasons  season  start date  end date  summer  1 december  28 February12  autumn  1 march  31 may  winter  1 june  31 august  spring  1 september  30 november  a tree in summer  in sweden and finland meteorologists use a non-calendar based definition for the seasons based on the temperature spring begins when the daily averaged temperature permanently rises above 0C, summer begins when the temperature permanently rises above summer ends when the temperature permanently falls below and winter begins when the temperature permanently falls below 0C. here means that the daily averaged temperature has remained above or below the limit for seven consecutive days this implies two things first the seasons do not begin at fixed dates but must be determined by observation and are known only after the fact and second a new season begins at different dates in different parts of the country in great britain the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50F in a defined sequence of days this almost always occurred in march however with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter  surface air temperature  diagram was calculated 21. of each month  calculation based on data published by jones et al  the picture shows figure 7 as published by jones et al.13

at least to the julian calendar used by the ancient romans it continues to be used on many modern gregorian calendars worldwide although some countries like australia new zealand and russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning the precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of cancer and capricorn for the solstices and the times of the suns transit over the equator for the equinoxes or a traditional date close to these times.15  the following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of apsides of earths elliptical orbit the orbital ellipse eccentricity exaggerated for effect goes through each of the six earth images which are sequentially the perihelion point to the sun on anywhere from 2 january to 5 january the point of march equinox on 19, 20 or 21 march the point of june solstice on 20 or 21 june the aphelion point from the sun on anywhere from 4 july to 7 july the september equinox on 22 or 23 september and the december solstice on 21 or 22 december  note distances are exaggerated and not to scale  these seasons are not of equal length because of the elliptical nature of the orbit of the earth as discovered by johannes kepler from the march equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the june solstice then 93.65 days until the september equinox 89.85 days until the december solstice and finally 88.99 days until the march equinox  variation due to calendar misalignmentedit  the times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern gregorian calendar but fall about six hours later every year amounting to one full day in four years they are reset by the occurrence of a leap year the gregorian calendar is designed to keep the march equinox no later than 21 march as accurately as is practical also see gregorian calendar seasonal error  the calendar equinox in the calculation of easter is 21 march the same date as in the easter tables current at the time of the council of nicaea in ad 325. the calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 march from nicaea to the date of the reform the years 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500, which would not have been leap years in the gregorian calendar amount to nine days but astronomers directed that ten days be removed  currently the most common equinox and solstice dates are march 20, june 21, september 22 or 23 and december 21 the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses this shift is a full day in about 128 years mainly by the century year rules of the gregorian calendar and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late this also means that in many years of the twentieth century the dates of march 21, june 22, september 23 and december 22 were much more common so older books teach older people may still remember these dates  note that all the times are given in utc speaking the time at greenwich ignoring british summer time people living farther to the east and australia whose local times are in advance will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later for example in tonga an equinox occurred on september 24, 1999, a date which will not crop up again until 2103. on the other hand people living far to the west whose clocks run behind utc may experience an equinox as early as march 19.  change over timeedit  over thousands of years the earths axial tilt and orbital eccentricity vary milankovitch cycles the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward thus ten thousand years from now earths northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion the severity of seasonal change the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location will also change over time because the earths axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees  smaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the moon and the other planets  solaredit  the annual cycle of insolation energy shown in blue with key points for seasons quarter days and cross-quarter days along with months and zodiac houses the cycle of temperature in pink is delayed by seasonal lag  solar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons it was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval europe especially by the celts and is still ceremonially observed in some east asian countries summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least  the solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days which are about 34 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 67 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices thus the day of greatest insolation is designated as noted in william shakespeares play a midsummer nights dream which is set on the summer solstice on the celtic calendar the traditional first day of winter is 1 november the celtic origin of halloween spring starts 1 february the celtic origin of groundhog day summer begins 1 may the celtic origin of may day the first day of autumn is 1 august lughnasadh the celtic dates corresponded to four pagan agricultural festivals  the traditional calendar in china forms the basis of other such systems in east asia its seasons are traditionally based on 24 periods known as solar terms.16 the four seasons chn xi qi and dng are universally translated as and but actually begin much earlier with the solstices and equinoxes forming the midpoint of each season rather than their start astronomically the seasons are said to begin on lichun litstanding spring on about 4 february lixia on about 6 may liqiu on about 8 august and lidong on about 7 november these dates were not part of the traditional lunar calendar however and moveable holidays such as chinese new year and the mid-autumn festival are more closely associated with the seasons  six-season calendar reckoningedit  some calendars in south asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three the dates are fixed at even intervals of months  in the hindu calendar of tropical and subtropical india there are six seasons or ritu that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates vasanta greeshma varsha sharad hemanta winter and shishira or late

of the arctic circle or south of the antarctic circle will have one period in the summer when the sun does not set and one period in the winter when the sun does not rise at progressively higher latitudes the maximum periods of sun and night are progressively longer  for example at the military and weather station alert located at 823005N and 622020W, on the northern tip of ellesmere island canada 450 nautical miles or 830km from the north pole the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of february and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer by 21 march the sun is up for over 12 hours on 6 april the sun rises at 0522 utc and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 september at 0335 utc by october 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes and on october 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 February.17  first light comes in late january because the sky has twilight being a glow on the horizon for increasing hours each day for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon from mid-november to mid-january there is no twilight  in the weeks surrounding 21 june in the northern polar region the sun is at its highest elevation appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon eventually it does go below the horizon for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of october when it disappears for the last time until the following february for a few more weeks is marked by decreasing periods of twilight eventually from mid-november to mid-january there is no twilight and it is continuously dark in mid january the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon just minutes per day and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of february then on 6 april the sun remains above the horizon until mid october  non-calendar-based reckoningedit  seasonal changes regarding a tree over a year  ecologically speaking a season is a period of the year in which only certain types of floral and animal events happen flowers bloomspring hedgehogs hibernatewinter so if we can observe a change in daily floralanimal events the season is changing in this sense ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative if specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season dont normally occur in a particular region then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis  modern mid-latitude ecologicaledit  six seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons.18 mild oceanic regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than continental climates while the prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near to the sea for example prevernal crocus blooms typically appear as early as february in mild coastal areas of british columbia the british isles and western and southern europe the actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the northern hemisphere  prevernal or pre-spring begins february or late january temperate march temperate deciduous tree buds begin to swell migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats  vernal begins march temperate april temperate tree buds burst into leaves birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting  estival summer begins june in most temperate climates trees in full leaf birds hatch and raise offspring  serotinal summer generally begins mid to late august deciduous leaves begin to change color young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration the traditional season begins  autumnal generally begins mid to late september tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground birds migrate back to wintering areas  hibernal begins december temperate november temperate deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay migrating birds settled in winter habitats  tropical ecologicaledit  in the tropics where seasonal dates also vary it is more common to speak of the rainy wet or monsoon season versus the dry season for example in nicaragua the dry season to april is called and the rainy season to october is called even though it is located in the northern hemisphere in some tropical areas a three-way division into hot rainy and cool season is used there is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year however many regions as the northern indian ocean are subject to monsoon rain and wind cycles  floral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wetdry cycles than seasonal temperature variations with different species flowering emerging from cocoons at specific times before during or after the monsoon season thus the tropics are characterized by numerous within the larger seasonal blocks of time  in the tropical parts of australia in the northern parts of queensland western australia and the northern territory wet and dry seasons are observed in addition to or in place of temperate season names.19  indigenous ecologicaledit  see also indigenous australian seasons  indigenous people in polar temperate and tropical climates of northern eurasia the americas africa oceania and australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants animals and weather around them each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the growing seasons of plants in the tropical rainforests in australia some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year,10 as do the sami people in scandinavia many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region  designationsedit  as noted a variety of dates are used in different countries to mark the changes of seasons especially those that are calendar based these observances are often declared within their respective jurisdictions by the local or national media even when the weather or climate is contradictory.20 however they are mainly a matter of custom only and have not generally been proclaimed by governments north or south of the equator for civil purposes.2122 the met office in the uk uses a three-month definition eg declaring to be march april and May.23 at least one researcher writing in the bulletin of the american meteorological society compared various definitions to actual temperature changes and recommended this three-month definition for general use in the united States.24  see alsoedit  equinox  growing season  indian
