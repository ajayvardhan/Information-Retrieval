article name of mexico  depiction of the founding myth of mexico-tenochtitlan from the codex mendoza  mxihco is the nahuatl term for the heartland of the aztec empire namely,34 the valley of mexico and its people the mexica and surrounding territories this became the future state of mexico as a division of new spain prior to independence latium it is generally considered to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the aztec triple alliance as a result or vice versa after new spain won independence from spain representatives decided to name the new country after its capital mexico city this was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient mexica capital of mexico-tenochtitlan  traditionally the name tenochtitlan was thought to come from nahuatl tetl and nchtli pear and is often thought to mean the prickly pears among rocks however one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as bancroft dialogues suggests the second vowel was short so that the true etymology remains uncertain.35  the suffix is the nahuatl locative making the word a place name beyond that the etymology is uncertain it has been suggested that it is derived from mextli or mxihtli a secret name for the god of war and patron of the mexica huitzilopochtli in which case mxihco means where huitzilopochtli lives.36 another hypothesis suggests that mxihco derives from a portmanteau of the nahuatl words for and navel this meaning at the center of the moon might refer to tenochtitlans position in the middle of lake texcoco the system of interconnected lakes of which texcoco formed the center had the form of a rabbit which the mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the moon still another hypothesis suggests that the word is derived from mctli the goddess of maguey.37  the name of the city-state was transliterated to spanish as mxico with the phonetic value of the letter in medieval spanish which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative this sound as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative represented by a evolved into a voiceless velar fricative during the 16th century this led to the use of the variant mjico in many publications in spanish most notably in spain whereas in mexico and most other spanishspeaking countries mxico was the preferred spelling in recent years the real academia espaola which regulates the spanish language determined that both variants are acceptable in spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is Mxico.38 the majority of publications in all spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm even though the alternative variant is still occasionally usedcitation needed in english the in mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound but the consonant cluster  the official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed the declaration of independence signed on november 6, 1813 by the deputies of the congress of anhuac called the territory amrica septentrional america on two occasions and 18631867, the country was known as imperio mexicano empire all three federal constitutions 1857 and 1917, the current constitution used the name estados unidos Mexicanos39or the variant estados-unidos Mexicanos,40 all of which have been translated as mexican states the phrase repblica mexicana republic was used in the 1836 constitutional Laws.41  history  main article history of mexico  see also history of roman catholicism in mexico economic history of mexico and history of mexico city  pre-columbian mexico  main articles pre-columbian mexico and mesoamerican chronology  view of the pyramid of the moon and entrance to the quetzalpaplotl palace during its peak in the classic era teotihuacan dominated the valley of mexico and exerted political and cultural influence in other areas such as in the petn basin  the earliest human artifacts in mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the valley of mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago.42 mexico is the site of the domestication of maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo-indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BCE.43  in the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the mesoamerican culture area.44 in this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms the most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed.45  the earliest complex civilization in mexico was the olmec culture which flourished on the gulf coast from around 1500 bce olmec cultural traits diffused through mexico into other formative-era cultures in chiapas oaxaca and the valley of mexico the formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes.46 the formative-era of mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization  in the subsequent pre-classical period the maya and zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at calakmul and monte albn respectively during this period the first true mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the epi-olmec and the zapotec cultures the mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the classic maya hieroglyphic script.47  in central mexico the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of teotihuacan which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the maya area as well as north teotihuacan with a population of more than 150,000 people had some of the largest pyramidal structures in the pre-columbian Americas.48 after the collapse of teotihuacn around 600 ce competition ensued between several important political centers in central mexico such as xochicalco and cholula at this time during the epi-classic nahua peoples began moving south into mesoamerica from the north and became politically and culturally dominant in central mexico as they displaced speakers of oto-manguean languages  post-classic period 10001519 ad  mural by diego rivera depicting the view from

originated the modern usage of as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade custom religion and language to the mexica state and xcn tlahtlyn the triple alliance in 1843, with the publication of the work of william h prescott it was adopted by most of the world including 19th-century mexican scholars who considered it a way to distinguish present-day mexicans from pre-conquest mexicans this usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century.49  the aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered the aztec did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tributes were paid.50  the aztec of central mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico.51 the aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale along with this practice they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle.52 this distinct mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the spanish conquest in the 16th century over the next centuries mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to spanish colonial rule.53  conquest of the aztec triple alliance  further information spanish conquest of mexico  hernn corts and la malinche meet moctezuma ii the image is from the lienzo de tlaxcala created c 1550 by the tlaxcalans to remind the spanish of their loyalty and the importance of tlaxcala during the conquest  the spanish first learned of mexico during the juan de grijalva expedition of 1518. the natives kept colua colua and mexico mexico but we did not know what colua or mexico meant until encountering montezumas governor at the mouth of the rio de las Banderas.543336 the spanish conquest of the aztec empire began in february 1519 when hernn corts arrived at the port in veracruz with ca 500 conquistadores after taking control of that city he moved on to the aztec capital in his search for gold and other riches corts decided to invade and conquer the aztec empire.55  storming of the teocalli by cortez and his troops emanuel leutze painting 1848  when the spaniards arrived the ruler of the aztec empire was moctezuma ii who was later killed his successor and brother cuitlhuac took control of the aztec empire but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later.56 unintentionally introduced by spanish conquerors among whom smallpox was endemic the infectious disease ravaged mesoamerica in the 1520s. it killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity.57 other sources however mentioned that the death toll of the aztecs might have reached 15 million of a population of less than 30 million although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million.58 severely weakened the aztec empire was easily defeated by corts and his forces on his second return with the help of state of tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000.59 the native population declined 8090 by 1600 to 12.5 million any population estimate of pre-columbian mexico is bound to be a guess but 812 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation  smallpox was a devastating disease it generally killed aztecs but not spaniards who as europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity.60 the deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of christianity in mexico and the americas at first the aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the spanish rule.61 many of the surviving aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the christian god which resulted in their acceptance of catholicism and yielding to the spanish rule throughout Mexico.62  the territory became part of the spanish empire under the name of new spain mexico city was systematically rebuilt by corts following the fall of tenochtitlan in 1521. much of the identity traditions and architecture of mexico developed during the 300-year colonial period.63  viceroyalty of new spain  main article new

city in 1521 was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which mexico was known as nueva espaa spain the kingdom of new spain was created from the remnants of the aztec hegemonic empire subsequent enlargements such as the conquest of the tarascan state resulted in the creation of the viceroyalty of new spain in 1535. the viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern mexico central america as far south as costa rica and the western united states the viceregal capital mexico city also administrated the spanish west indies caribbean the spanish east indies philippines and spanish florida  the indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre-contact population the population decline was primarily the result of communicable diseases particularly smallpox introduced during the columbian exchange during the three hundred years of the colonial era mexico received between 400,000 and 500,000 europeans between 200,00064 and 250,000 Africans65 and between 40,000 and 120,000 Asians.66 the 18th century saw a great increase in the percentage of mestizos.67  colonial law with spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction cabildos and the spanish crown whereby upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people even those of pure spanish blood administration was based on the racial separation of the population among of spaniards amerindians and castas

guadalupe victoria became the first president of the newly born country central america including chiapas left the union in 1829 president guerrero abolished slavery.72 the first decades of the post-independence period were marked by economic instability which led to the pastry war in 1836. there was constant strife between liberales supporters of a federal form of government and conservadores who proposed a hierarchical form of governmentcitation needed  during this period the frontier borderlands to the north became quite isolated from the government in mexico city and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering with limited trade the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central governments actions in collecting customs resentment built up

stabilize and develop the frontier mexico encouraged immigration into present-day texas as they were unable to persuade people from central mexico to move into those areas they allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers who were primarily protestant english speakers from the united states within several years the anglos far outnumbered the tejano in the area itinerant traders traveled

million inhabitants235 making it the most populous spanish-speaking country in the world.236 between 2005 and 2010, the mexican population grew at an average of 1.70 per year up from 1.16 per year between 2000 and 2005.  even though mexico is a very ethnically diverse country research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of mexicos government to unify all mexicans under a single ethnic identity of the as a result since 1930 the only ethnic classification that has been included in mexican censuses has been that of peoples.237 even then across the years the government has used different criteria to count indigenous peoples with each of them returning considerably different numbers it is not until very recently that the mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered the afro-mexican and euro-mexican population that lives in the country  as of 2015update, the foreign-born population was 1,007,063.238 the majority of these individuals were born in the united states and mexico is home to the largest number of us citizens abroad.239 after americans the largest immigrant groups are guatemalans spaniards and colombians besides the spanish large immigrant-descended groups are the french germans lebanese and chinese mexico is the largest source of immigration to the united States.240 some 11.6 million residents of the united states have mexican citizenship as of 2014update.241  ethnicity and race  de espaol e india mestiza 1763,  miguel cabrera  de espaol y negra mulata 1763,  miguel cabrera  de negro e india zamba 1763,  miguel cabrera  depictions of the three main castas resulting from miscegenation of europeans africans and indigenous americans produced during the age of enlightenment the pinturas de castas attempted to categorize the racial diversity of mexico but some sets were also manifestations of early national self-pride wealth and order depicted through clothing mercantile goods and religious symbols challenged preconceived notions of new spain in Europe.242  mexico is ethnically diverse with people of several ethnicities being united under a single national identity.243 the core part of mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of cultures primarily european culture and indigenous cultures in a process known as mestizaje.243244 mexican politicians and reformers such as jos vasconcelos of the cosmic race and manuel gamio of indigenismo were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje.245  the large majority of mexicans have historically been classified as in modern mexican usage the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was during the colonial era resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity regardless of wheter they are of mixed ancestry or not.246 since the term carries a variety of different socio-cultural economic racial and biological meanings it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification thus it was abandoned by the government and is not in wide use in mexican society,117247 although its often used in literature about mexican social identities and on intellectual circles in the yucatn peninsula the word mestizo has historically had a different meaning being used to refer to the maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos.248 in chiapas the word is used instead of mestizo.249 according to encyclopdia britannica racially mestizo mexicans make up 50 to 67 of the countrys population.250  the total percentage of mexicos population who is indigenous varies considerably depending of the criteria used by the government on its censuses it is 5.4 if the hability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous,251 if racial self-identification is used its 14.9252253 and if people who considers themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 21.5.254 nonetheless all the censuses conclude that the majority of mexicos indigenous population is concentrated in the southern and south-eastern mexican states primarily in rural areas some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of y costumbres which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law according to the national commission for the development of indigenous peoples the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are255 yucatn at 59, quintana roo 39 and campeche 27, chiefly maya oaxaca with 48 of the population the most numerous groups being the mixtec and zapotec peoples chiapas at 28, the majority being tzeltal and tzotzil maya hidalgo 24, the majority being otomi puebla 19, and guerrero 17, mostly nahua peoples and the states of san luis potos and veracruz both home to a population that is 15 indigenous mostly from the totonac nahua and teenek groups.256 the absolute numbers of the indigenous population growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling.257 all of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average in all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations literacy rates are also much lower with 27 of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12. the indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average starting earlier and continuing longer however 55 of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary compared to 20 for the national average many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing.256  similarly to mestizo and indigenous peoples estimations for the percentage of european-descended mexicans within the mexican population vary considerably their numbers range from around 1020 according to the encyclopdia Britannica250 to as high as 47258259 according to a nationwide survey conducted by mexicos government made with the intent of having a precise outlook of the social and economic inequalities that exist between light skinned european looking mexicans and indigenous or african looking Mexicans,260 is the first time the mexican government has conducted an official population study that referenced mexicos white population in nearly a century  while during the colonial era most of the european migration into mexico was spanish in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non-spanish europeans immigrated to the country according to 20th and 21st century academics large scale intermixing between european immigrants and native indigenous peoples would produce a mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of mexicos population by the time of the mexican revolution.261 however according to church registers from the colonial times the majority of european men married with european women said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics such as european migrants who arrived to mexico being almost exclusively men.262 nowadays mexicos northern and western regions have the highest european populations with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly european ancestry.263  the afro-mexican population individuals as of 2015update264 is an ethnic group made up of descendants of colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-saharan african descent mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200,000 africans were taken there primarily in the 17th century the creation of a national mexican identity especially after the mexican revolution emphasized mexicos indigenous and european past it passively eliminated the african ancestors and contributions most of the african-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding mestizo europeanindigenous and indigenous populations through unions among the groups evidence of this long history of intermarriage with mestizo and indigenous mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census 64.9 of afro-mexicans also identified as indigenous it was also reported that 9.3 of afro-mexicans speak an indigenous language.265 the states with the highest self-report of afro-mexicans were guerrero of the population oaxaca and veracruz afro-mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the costa chica of oaxaca and costa chica of guerrero  during the early 20th century a substantial number of arabs Christians267 began arriving from the crumbling ottoman empire the largest group were the lebanese and an estimated 400,000 mexicans have some lebanese ancestry.268 smaller ethnic groups in mexico include south and east asians present since the colonial era during the colonial era asians were termed chino of ethnicity and arrived as merchants artisans and slaves.269 the largest group were filipinos and some 200,000 mexicans can trace filipino ancestry.270 modern asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century the chinese were the second largest immigrant group.271  official censuses  the first census in mexico that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census also known as the revillagigedo census it was mexicos known as new spain first national population census most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as prussian geographer alexander von humboldt while every author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country they dont seem to vary much with europeans ranging from 18 to 22 of new spains population mestizos ranging from 21 to 25, indians ranging from 51 to 61 and africans being between 6,000 and 10,000, the estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. it is concluded then that across nearly three centuries of colonization the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 1317 per century the authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates the reason for the indigenous populations numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the spanish colonists or being at war with them.272 anthropologist gonzalo aguirre beltrn goes beyond said numbers and splits the mestizo group into and calculating their numbers on more than one million 700,000 and 600,000 respectively.273 independent-era mexico eliminated the legal basis of the colonial caste system which led to exclude racial classification in the censuses to come  according to mexicos second census ever which considered race made right after the mexican revolution on 1921,274 59 of mexicos population was mestizo 29 was indigenous and only 9 was european with mestizos being the most numerous ethno-racial group in almost all the states.274 for a long time this census results have been taken as fact with extraofficial international publications such as the world factbook and encyclopdia britannica using them as a reference to estimate mexicos racial composition up to this day.275250 however in recent time mexican academics have subjected the census results to scrutiny claiming that such a drastic alteration on demographic trends in regards to the 1793 census is not possible and cite among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.276 said authors claim that the mexican society went through a cultural than biological mestizaje process sponsored by the state on its efforts to unify the mexican population which resulted on the inflation of the percentage of the mestizo mexican group at the expense of the identity of the other races that exist in Mexico.277  in recent times the mexican government has decided to conduct ethnic surveys and censuses again and has also widen the criteria to classify the ethnicies who were already considered an example being the indigenous mexican classification which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities andor spoke an indigenous language according to these recent surveys indigenous peoples amount to 21.5 of mexicos population people who declared to be partially indigenous,254 afro-mexicans are 1.2 of mexicos population people who declared to be partially African254 and european mexicans amount to 47 of mexicos population on appearance rather than on self-declared of ancestry.258259260 less numerous groups in mexico such as asians and middle easterners are also accounted for albeit their numbers do not vary significantly from previous estimations out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed that of mestizos is notably absent which may be consequence of the ethnic labels fluid and subjective definition which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that mexicans have to identify people with ethnic labels rather than ones.278  languages  main article languages of mexico  the country has the largest spanish-speaking population in the world with almost a third of all spanish native speakers.236279  almost all of the mexican population speaks spanish 99.3 according to the latest census280 nonetheless around 5.4 still speaks an indigenous language besides spanish the indigenous languages with the most speakers are nahuatl spoken by approximately 1.45 million people,281 yukatek maya spoken by some 750,000 people and the Mixtec282 and zapotec languages,283 each spoken by more than 400,000 people  the national institute of indigenous languages inali recognizes 68 linguistic groups and some 364 different specific varieties of indigenous languages.284 since the promulgation of the law of indigenous linguistic rights in 2003, these languages have had status as national languages with equal validity with spanish in all the areas and contexts in which they are spoken.285  in addition to the indigenous languages other minority languages are spoken by immigrant populations such as the 80,000 german-speaking mennonites in Mexico,286 and 5,000 speakers of the chipilo dialect of the venetian language spoken in chipilo puebla  arabic is the most commonly spoken foreign language in Mexico.287  urban areas  main article metropolitan
