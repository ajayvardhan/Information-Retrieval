senator from alachua county had opened a school in gainesville the gainesville academy in 1858. in 1866,19 roper offered his land and school to the state of florida in exchange for the east florida seminarys relocation to Gainesville.20  the second major precursor to the university of florida was the florida agricultural college established at lake city by jordan probst in 1884. florida agricultural college became the states first land-grant college under the morrill act in 1903, the florida legislature desiring to expand the schools outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins changed the name of florida agricultural college to the of florida a name the school would hold for only two years.21  of the state of floridaedit  in 1905, the florida legislature passed the buckman act which consolidated the states publicly supported higher education institutions the member of the legislature who wrote the act henry holland buckman later became the namesake of

the system it also abolished the six pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new of the state of

and an homage to the scottish and ulster-scots presbyterian heritage of the original founders of gainesville and alachua county most of whom were settlers from north carolina whose ancestors were
