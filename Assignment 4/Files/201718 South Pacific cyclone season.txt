201617, 201718, 201819, 201920  the 201718 south pacific cyclone season is the period of the year when most tropical cyclones form within the south pacific ocean to the east of 160E. the season officially runs from november 1, 2017 to april 30, 2018, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between july 1, 2017 and june 30, 2018 and would count towards the season total during the season tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the regional specialized meteorological center in nadi fiji and the tropical cyclone warning centers in brisbane australia and wellington new zealand the united states armed forces through the joint typhoon warning center will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for american interests rsmc nadi attaches a number and an f suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the jtwc designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a p suffix rsmc nadi tcwc wellington and tcwc brisbane all use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes while the jtwc estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period which are subsequently compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale  contents  1 seasonal forecasts  2 storm names  3 season effects  4 see also  5 references  6 external links  seasonal forecastsedit  sourcerecord  tropical

the cyclone season the fiji meteorological service australian bureau of meteorology new zealands metservice and national institute of water and atmospheric research and various other pacific meteorological services all contributed towards the island climate update tropical cyclone outlook that was released during october 2016.3 the outlook took into account the enso neutral conditions that had been observed across the pacific and analogue seasons that had enso neutral and weak la nina conditions occurring during the season.3 the outlook called for a near average number of tropical cyclones for the 201718 season with eight to ten named tropical cyclones to occur between 135E and 120W compared to an average of about 10.3 at least three of the tropical cyclones were expected to become category 3 severe tropical cyclones while two could become category 4 severe tropical cyclones they also noted that a category 5 severe tropical cyclone was not likely to occur during the season.3  in addition to contributing towards the island climate update outlook the fms and the bom issued their own seasonal forecasts for the south pacific region.24 the bom issued two seasonal forecasts for the southern pacific ocean for their self-defined eastern and western regions of the south pacific Ocean.4 they predicted that the western region between 142.5E and 165E, had a 48 chance of seeing activity above its average of 7 tropical cyclones the bom also predicted that the eastern region between 165E and 120W, had a 55 chance of seeing activity above its average of 4 tropical cyclones.4 within their outlook the fms predicted that between four and six tropical cyclones would occur within the basin compared to an average of around 7.1 cyclones.2 at least one of the tropical cyclones was expected to intensify into a category 3 or higher severe tropical cyclone.2 they also predicted that the main area for tropical cyclogenesis would be within the coral sea to the west of the international Dateline.2  both the island climate update and the fms tropical cyclone outlooks assessed the risk of a tropical cyclone affecting a certain island or territory.23 the island climate update outlook predicted that new caledonia tonga new zealand and papua new guinea had an above average chance of being impacted by a tropical cyclone or the.3 they also predicted that the solomon islands fiji and vanuatu had a near normal to normal risk of being impacted by one or more tropical cyclones.3 the southern cook islands american samoa samoa niue tokelau tuvalu as well as wallis and futuna were thought to have a below average chance of being impacted it was also considered unlikley that the northern cook islands french polynesia kiribati and the pitcairn islands would be affected by a tropical cyclone.3 the fmss outlook predicted that vanuatu new caledonia fiji as well as wallis and futuna had a normal chance of being impacted by a tropical cyclone.2 the outlook also predicted that the solomon islands tokelau samoa tonga niue cook islands and french polynesia had a reduced chance of being affected by a tropical cyclone.2 it was thought that there was a normal risk of vanuatu new caledonia fiji and samoa being impacted by at least one severe tropical cyclone while other areas such as the solomon islands tokelau samoa tonga niue and french polynesia had a reduced chance of being impacted by a severe tropical cyclone.2  storm namesedit  see also lists of tropical cyclone names  within the southern pacific a tropical depression is judged to have reached tropical cyclone intensity should it reach winds of 65kmh, and it is evident that gales are occurring at least halfway around the center with tropical depressions intensifying into a tropical cyclone between the equator and 25S and between 160E 120W named by the rsmc nadi however should a tropical depression intensify to the south of 25S between 160E and 120W it will be named in conjunction with rsmc nadi by tcwc wellington should a tropical cyclone move out of the basin and into the australian region it will retain its original name the next 10 names on the naming list are listed here below.5
