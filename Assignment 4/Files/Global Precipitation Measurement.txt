march 2017  global precipitation measurement is a joint mission between jaxa and nasa as well as other international space agencies to make frequent 23 hours observations of earths precipitation it is part of nasas earth systematic missions program and works with a satellite constellation to provide full global coverage the project provides global precipitation maps to assist researchers in improving the forecasting of extreme events studying global climate and adding to current capabilities for using such satellite data to benefit society.1 gpm builds on the notable successes of the tropical rainfall measuring mission which was also a joint nasa-jaxa activity  the project is managed by nasas goddard space flight center and consists of a gpm core observatory satellite assisted by a constellation of spacecraft from other agencies and missions.2 the core observatory satellite measures the two and three dimensional structure of earths precipitation patterns and provides a new calibration standard for the rest of the satellite constellation the gpm core observatory was assembled and tested at goddard space flight center and launched from tanegashima space center japan on a mitsubishi heavy industries h-iia rocket the launch occurred on february 28, 2014 at 337am jst on the first attempt.3 agencies in the united states japan india and france with eumetsat operate the remaining satellites in the constellation for agency-specific goals but also cooperatively provide data for GPM.2  contents  1 gpm core observatory instruments  1.1 dual-frequency precipitation radar

space flight center in march 2013. the silver disc and drum is the gpm microwave imager and the large block on the base is the dual-frequency precipitation radar  dual-frequency precipitation radar  the dpr is a spaceborne radar providing three-dimensional maps of storm structure across its swath including the intensity of rainfall and snowfall at the surface the dpr has two frequencies allowing researchers to estimate the sizes of precipitation particles and detect a wider range of precipitation rates the ku-band radar similar to the pr on trmm covers a 245km mile swath nested inside that the ka-band radar covers a 120km mile swath.4  gpm microwave imager  the gmi is a passive sensor that observes the microwave energy emitted by the earth and atmosphere at 13 different frequencypolarization channels these data allow quantitative maps of precipitation across a swath that is 885km miles wide this instrument continues the legacy of trmm microwave observations while adding four additional channels better resolution and more reliable calibration.4  precipitation data setsedit  gpm produces and distributes a wide variety of precipitation data products processing takes place at the precipitation processing system at nasa goddard space flight center as well as at the jaxa facility in japan data is provided at multiple of processing from raw satellite measurements to best-estimate global precipitation maps using combinations of all the constellation observations and other meteorological data all data from the mission is made freely available to the public on nasa websites.5 precipitation data is made available in a variety of formats spatial and temporal resolutions and processing levels which are accessible on the precipitation measurement missions access webpage.6 several data visualization and analysis tools have been made available to provide easy access for the science and applications communities which include the in-browser earth science data analysis tool Giovanni,7 a web API,8 and a 3D near-realtime global precipitation viewer.9  full-scale harness mockup model of the core gpm spacecraft being used for harness assembly

addition to maintaining social media accounts101112 and the gpm road to launch blog jaxa and nasa developed several outreach activities specific to this mission prior to launch that the public could participate in after launch a series of featured articles13 and videos14 were produced to highlight various scientific goals and discoveries of the mission and an weather blog is maintained to provide timely updates about the latest extreme precipitation events and natural disasters occurring around the world a precipitation education website15 is also maintained to provide teachers and students with lesson plans animations and other resources to teach about the water cycle earth science and the gpm mission  nasa socials  jaxa-nasa dc cherry blossom event  april 12, 2013, at nasas goddard
