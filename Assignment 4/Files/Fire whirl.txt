fire whirl  a fire whirl with flames in the vortex  a fire whirl also commonly known as a fire devil or many cases erroneously as a fire tornado firenado or fire twister is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash they usually start with a whirl of wind or smoke fire whirls may occur when intense rising heat and turbulent wind conditions combine to form whirling eddies of air these eddies can contract into a tornado-like vortex that sucks in burning debris and combustible gases  fire whirls are sometimes colloquially called fire tornadoes but are not usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base also even in such cases even those fire whirls are not classic tornadoes in that their vorticity derives from surface winds and heat-induced lifting rather than a tornadic mesocyclone aloft the literal fire tornado is a rare phenomenon much more powerful and destructive than the a typical fire whirl in which the wildfire generates a pyrocumulonimbus cloud that then spawns a tornado when this tornado forms in or enters the fire zone it fans flames enormously draws flame and burning debris into itself and scatters burning debris over a wide area  contents  1 formation  2 examples  3 classification  4 references  4.1 notes  4.2 bibliography  5 external links  formationedit  a fire whirl consists of a burning core and an rotating pocket of air a fire whirl can reach up to 2,000F often fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind which can turn into a vortex of fire this causes the tall and skinny appearance of a fire whirls core  most of the largest fire whirls are spawned from wildfires they form when a warm updraft and convergence from the wildfire are present.2 they are usually 10-50 meters tall a few meters wide and last only a few minutes however some can be more than a kilometer tall contain winds over 160 kmh and persist for more than 20 minutes.3  fire whirls can uproot trees up to 15 metres tall.4 these can also aid the ability of wildfires to propagate and start new fires as they lift burning materials such as tree bark these burning embers can be blown away from the fireground by the stronger winds aloft  examplesedit  another fire whirl  an extreme example of a fire tornado is the 1923 great kant earthquake in japan which ignited a large city-sized firestorm and produced a gigantic fire whirl that killed 38,000 people in fifteen minutes in the hifukusho-ato region of Tokyo.5  another example is the numerous large fire whirls tornadic that developed after lightning struck an oil storage facility near san luis obispo california on 7 april 1926, several of which produced significant structural damage well away from the fire killing two many whirlwinds were produced by the four-day-long firestorm coincident with conditions that produced severe thunderstorms in which the larger fire whirls carried debris 5 kilometers away.6  a fire whirl of reportedly uncommon size for new zealand wildfires formed on day three of the 2017 port hills fires in christchurch pilots estimated the fire column to be 100 metres high.7  classificationedit  there are currently three known types of fire whirls8  type 1 stable and centered over burning area  type 2 stable or transient downwind of burning area  type 3 steady or transient centered over an open area adjacent to an asymmetric burning area with wind  there is evidence suggesting that the fire whirl in the hifukusho-ato area during the great kanto earthquake of 1923, was of type 3.9  referencesedit  notesedit  fortofer jason september 2012 fire tornado spotted in australia national geographic  umscheid michael e monteverdi jp davies jm and analysis of an unusually large and long-lived firewhirl electronic journal of severe storms meteorology 1  grazulis thomas p 1993. significant tornadoes 16801991 a chronology and analysis of events st johnsbury vt the tornado project of environmental films ISBN1-879362-03-1.  billing p ed 1983. otways fire no 22 198283 aspects of fire behaviour research report No.20 victoria department of sustainability and environment retrieved 2012-12-19.  quintiere james g principles of fire behavior thomson delmar learning ISBN0-8273-7732-0.  hissong j e at oil-tank fire san luis obispo calif mon wea rev 54 1613.
