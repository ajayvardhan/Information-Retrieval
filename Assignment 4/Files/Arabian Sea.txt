trade routesedit  the arabian sea has been an important marine trade route since the era of the coastal sailing vessels from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium bce certainly the late 2nd millennium bce through the later days known as the age of sail by the time of julius caesar several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon water transport through the sea around the rough inland terrain features to its north  names routes and locations of the periplus of the erythraean sea  these routes usually began in the far east or down river from madhya pradesh with transshipment via historic bharuch traversed past the inhospitable coast of todays iran then split around hadhramaut into two streams north into the gulf of aden and thence into the levant or south into alexandria via red sea ports such as axum each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates  this southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern arabian peninsula and oman today was significant and the egyptian pharaohs built several shallow canals to service the trade one more or less along the route of todays suez canal and another from the red sea to the nile river both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge sand storms in antiquity later the kingdom of axum arose in ethiopia to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with europe via alexandria  major portsedit  the kochi port located on the south-west coast of india is the nearest indian

start in 1997, the omani container transhipment port has achieved consistent growth it is a key container transhipment hub on the arabian sea and is often used as the first port of call for vessels whose crew have just been released from the clutches of somali pirates following ransom payments for withheld vessels and crew the port also plays host as a supply base for the visiting warships that provide protective escorts for merchant shipping in the sea lanes from that dual role has emerged another one as an intelligence network both military and civilian to exchange information on possible pirate sightings and near misses also the international task force often uses the port as a base there is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port which makes it a

life is found nowhere else on the planet it has been described as the most alien-looking place on earth  masirah is an island off the east coast of oman the main industries here are fishing and traditional textile manufacturing formerly traditional ship building was important the rugged terrain of the island and surrounding rough coastline has led to the appearance of many wrecked dhows on the beaches of the island most of them well preserved by the salt water and intense heat the ocean bottom environment surrounding masirah is hostile as the majority of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock despite the poor quality ocean bottom the area is very productive with marine fisheries and any hard objects engines are immediately colonized by local fauna  see alsoedit
