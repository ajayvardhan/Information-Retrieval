2009.46  external audio  lin-manuel miranda talks once a pitch now a revolution interview with scott simon npr april 9, 2016  while on vacation from performing in his hit broadway show in the heights lin-manuel miranda bought a copy of alexander hamilton by ron chernow a biography of alexander hamilton at an airport after finishing the first few chapters miranda began to envision the life of hamilton as a musical and researched whether a stage musical of hamiltons life had been created all he found was that a play of hamiltons story had been done on broadway in 1917, starring george arliss as alexander Hamilton.47  miranda therefore began a project entitled the hamilton mixtape on may 12, 2009, miranda was invited to perform music from in the heights at the white house evening of poetry music and the spoken word instead he performed the first song from the hamilton mixtape a rough version of what would later become hamilton hamiltons opening number he spent a year after that working on shot another early number from the show.48  miranda performed in a workshop production of the show then titled the hamilton mixtape at the vassar reading festival on july 27, 2013.49 the

korins costumes by paul tazewell lighting by howell binkley and sound by nevin steinberg who all reprised their roles from the off-broadway production.55  the production was critically acclaimed by many theater analysts.15657  chicago  hamilton opened at the cibc theatre in chicago on october 19, 2016, following previews from september 27, 2016.58 it is currently booking through april 29, 2018.59 according to lead producer jeffrey seller the show may be in residence for two years or more.60 on its opening attended by author miranda the chicago production received strongly positive reviews.616263 miranda praised the chicago casts performance during a later television interview.64  us touring productions  plans for a national tour of hamilton emerged near the end of january 2016. the tour was initially announced with over 20 stops scheduled from 2017 through at least 2020.65 tickets to the tours run in san franciscoits debut citysold out within 24 hours of release the number of people who entered the online waiting room to purchase tickets surpassed 110,000.66 the first national touring production began preview performances at san franciscos shn orpheum theatre on march 10, 2017 and officially opened on march 23. the production ran in san francisco until august 5, when it transferred to los angeles hollywood pantages theatre for a run from august 11 to december 30, 2017.  just days after the first us tour began performances in san francisco news emerged that a second us tour of hamilton would begin in seattle for a six-week limited engagement before touring north america concurrently with the first tour.11 to distinguish the first and second touring productions the production team has labeled them respectively the tour and the tour.65  the angelica tour alone requires 14 truckloads of cargo and a core group of over 60 traveling cast crew and musicians.65 the production team insisted that each tour must be able to duplicate the original broadway shows choreography which literally revolves around two concentric turntables on the stage.65 this led to the construction of four portable sets two for each tour so that one set can be assembled well in advance at the next stop while the tour is still playing at the last stop.65  west end  cameron mackintosh will produce a london production which will re-open the victoria palace theatre undergoing a refurbishment following the closure of billy elliot the musical on december 21, 2017, following previews from december 6.10 initial principal casting was announced on january 26, 2017.20  box office and business  the musicals engagement at the off-broadway public theater was sold out.6  when the musical opened on broadway it had a multimillion-dollar advance in ticket sales reportedly taking in before its official opening.67 hamilton was the second-highest-grossing show on broadway for the labor day week ending september 6, 2015 only the lion King.68 as of september 2015, the show has been sold out for most of its broadway engagement.7  hamilton like other broadway musicals offers a lottery before every show twenty-one front row seats and occasional standing room are given out in the lottery chosen winners are able to purchase two tickets at each unlike other broadway shows hamiltons lottery process drew in large crowds of people that created a significant congestion problems for west 46th Street.69 even though many people were not able to win the lottery hamilton creator lin-manuel miranda prepared mini-performances right before the lotteries were drawn they were dubbed the shows due to the fact that if you won you gave a hamilton bill in exchange for seeing the show people were then able to experience a part of the show even when they did not win the lottery.70 the lottery was eventually placed online to avoid increasing crowds and dangerous traffic conditions.71 on its first day more than 50,000 people entered which resulted in the website crashing.72 trevor boffonewho in his essay on howlround wrote follows a long tradition of latinao the ancestors of present-day latinaos theatremaking that dates back to when the events in hamilton were happening the philosophy behind this is simple if the people wont come to the theatre then take the theatre to the people while el teatro campesinos it to the streets originated from a place of social protest Ham4Ham does so to create accessibility tap into social media and ultimately generate a free self-functioning marketing campaign in this way Ham4Ham falls into a lineage of accessibility as a latinao theatremaking aesthetic.73 following mirandas departure from the show on july 9, 2016, rory omalley then playing king george iii took over as the host of Ham4Ham.74 the Ham4Ham show officially ended on august 31, 2016, after over a year of performances though the lottery still continues daily.75  hamilton set a broadway box office record for the most money grossed in a single week in new york city in late november 2016, it grossed for an eight performance week the first show to break in eight performances.76  critical response  marilyn stasio in her review of the off-broadway production for variety wrote music is exhilarating but the lyrics are the big surprise the sense as well as the sound of the sung dialogue has been purposely suited to each character george washington a stately figure in jacksons dignified performance sings in polished prose but in the end mirandas impassioned narrative of one mans story becomes the collective narrative of a nation a nation built by immigrants who occasionally need to be reminded where they came from.77  the hamilton cast and crew greets president barack obama on july 18, 2015.  in his review of the off-broadway production jesse green in new york wrote conflict between independence and interdependence is not just the shows subject but also its method it brings the complexity of forming a union from disparate constituencies right to your ears few are the theatergoers who will be familiar with all of mirandas touchstones i caught the verbal references to rodgers and hammerstein gilbert and sullivan sondheim west side story and 1776, but other people had to point out to me the frequent hat-tips to hip-hop whether its a watershed a breakthrough and a game changer as some have been saying is another matter miranda is too savvy loves his antecedents too much to try to reinvent all the rules at once those duels by the waythere are three of themare superbly handled the highlights of a riveting if at times overbusy staging by the director thomas kail and the choreographer andy Blankenbuehler.78 although giving a positive review elisabeth vincentelli of the new york post was founded by hamilton himself wrote that hamilton and burrs lovehate relationship to drive the showpartly because miranda lacks the charisma and intensity of the man he portrays and that many of the numbers are exposition-heavy lessons as if this were rap the show is burdened with eye-glazingly dull stretches especially those involving george Washington.79  ben brantley in reviewing the broadway production in the new york times wrote am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit broadway show but hamilton directed by thomas kail and starring mr miranda might just about be worth it washington jefferson madisontheyre all here making war and writing constitutions and debating points of economic structure so are aaron burr and the marquis de lafayette they wear the clothes paul tazewell you might expect them to wear in a traditional costume drama and the big stage they inhabit has been done up david korins to suggest a period-appropriate tavern where incendiary youth might gather to drink brawl and plot revolution.1  david cote in his review of the broadway production for time out new york wrote love hamilton i love it like i love new york or broadway when it gets it right and this is so right a sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop well as rb britpop and trad showstoppers under-dramatized american history and mirandas uniquely personal focus as a first-generation puerto rican and inexhaustible wordsmith hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons hard the works human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing he chose hamilton as a critics pick and gave the production five out of five stars.3  a review in the economist notes that the production enjoys critical acclaim.80 barack obama joked that admiration for the musical is only thing

throughout the musical hamilton in various keys tempos and timbres depending on the context this is one example of how hamilton weaves melodic and lyrical reprises into later songs in the score in order to cue an emotional response  according to an article in the new yorker the show is achievement of historical and cultural reimagining the costumes and set reflect the period with frock coats and knee britches the set a wooden scaffold against exposed brick the warm lighting suggests candlelight.4 the musical is mostly sung and rapped all the way through with little dialogue isolated outside of the musical score.162100  casting diversity  miranda said that the portrayal of hamilton thomas jefferson george washington and other white historical figures by black and hispanic actors should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members cast looks like america looks now and thats certainly intentional he said a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.101 he noted telling the story of old dead white men but were using actors of color and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.102  the pro-immigration message of hamilton is at the forefront as the show revolves around the life of one of the founding fathers of america alexander hamilton and how he made his mark in american politics as an immigrant instead of being characterized as a white person alexander hamiltons immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show alongside with the virtue and prowess of hamilton working a lot harder by being a lot smarter by being a self-starter described in the shows opening in order to foster a positive image of immigrants.103 alongside this the casting of black latino and asian american leads allowed audiences to literally view america as a nation of immigrants with the intention of showing how irrelevant the founding fathers whiteness is to their claim on the country.104 is a story about america and the most beautiful thing about it is its told by such a diverse cast with a such diverse styles of music according to renee elise goldberry who played angelica schuyler have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us dont necessarily think is our own.105 miranda has stated that he is open to women playing the founding Fathers.106 casting for the british production is expected to feature predominantly black british artists.107108  historical accuracy  chronology and events  although hamilton was based on true events miranda did use some dramatic license in retelling the story for example while angelica did have a strong relationship with hamilton it was exaggerated in the show during angelica explains why hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him in particular she states a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich my father has no sons so im the one who has to social climb for one in actuality angelica had less pressure on her to do this philip schuyler actually had fifteen children including two sons who survived into adulthood of whom was new york state assemblyman philip jeremiah schuyler and angelica had eloped with john barker church three years before she met hamilton at her sisters wedding when she was already mother of two of her eight children with Church.109 miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if angelica is available but cannot marry him.110111112  in addition in act i burrs role in hamiltons life is overstated and much of the early interactions between the two men in the show are fictionalized for example while burr was present at the battle on monmouth burr did not serve as charles lees second in his duel with john laurens as seen in duel commandments lees second was evan Edwards113 hamilton also never approached burr to help write the federalist papers as portrayed in  during act i the character of aaron burr says that washington named her feral tomcat after him to which alexander hamilton replies true115 in fact it is false the idea of hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real alexander hamilton for centuries with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of tomcat as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century the story has been previously discredited by author stephen Knott,116 and refuted by historian and author michael e newton at the hamilton discoveries and findings talk held by the alexander hamilton awareness society at liberty hall university as part of the 2016 celebratehamilton events.117118  in act ii there are multiple inaccuracies throughout hamiltons decline probably due to time constraints and narrative arc while it is true that john adams and hamilton did not particularly get along john adams did not fire hamilton as told in the show hamilton tendered his resignation from his position as secretary of the treasury on december 1, 1794,119 two years before adams became president however hamilton remained close friends with washington and highly influential in the political sphere.120 in addition jefferson madison and burr did not approach hamilton about his affair it was actually james monroe frederick muhlenberg and abraham venable in december 1792.121 monroe was a close friend of jeffersons and shared the information of hamiltons affair with him in the summer of 1797, journalist james callender broke the story of hamiltons infidelity hamilton blamed monroe and the altercation nearly ended in a duel.122 with nothing left to do hamilton then published the reynolds pamphlet.123 in us all away george eacker and philip hamilton engage in a duel before the events of the 1800 presidential election the duel actually occurred in 1801, with philip hamilton dying on november 24. in the show eacker fires on philip at the count of seven while what happened in real-life is almost the opposite both men refused to fire for over a minute before eacker shot philip in the hips.124 lastly it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to burr and hamiltons duel burr did become jeffersons vice-president but when jefferson decided to not run with burr for reelection in 1804, burr opted to run for governor of new york instead burr lost to morgan lewis in a landslide afterwards a letter was published from charles d cooper to philip schuyler claiming that hamilton called burr dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government and that he knew of still more despicable opinion which general hamilton has expressed of mr Burr.125 this led to the letters between burr and hamilton as seen in the show in obedient servant  critical analysis and scholarship  the show has been critiqued for a simplistic depiction of hamilton and vilification of jefferson joanne b freeman a history professor at Yale,126 contrasted the shows hamilton to the hamilton was a mass of contradictions an immigrant who sometimes distrusted immigrants a revolutionary who placed a supreme value on law and order a man who distrusted the rumblings of the masses yet preached his politics to them more frequently and passionately than many of his more democracy-friendly fellows.127  australian historian shane white found the framing of the shows story stating that he and many historian colleagues like to imagine that hamilton is a last convulsion of the founding father mythology.128 according to white mirandas depiction of the founding of the united states new life into an older view of american history that centered on the founding fathers instead of joining the many historians who were to get away from the great men story by incorporating people african-americans native americans and women into a inclusive and nuanced historical narrative in which hamilton has a rather than leading role.128  rutgers university professor lyra monteiro criticized the shows multi-ethnic casting as obscuring a complete lack of identifiable enslaved or free persons of color as characters in the show.129 monteiro identified other commentators such as ishmael reed who criticized the show for making hamilton and other historical personages appear more progressive on racial injustice than they really were.129 according to reed reputation has been shored up as an abolitionist and someone who was opposed to slavery which reed stated was untrue.130  in the baffler policy analyst matt stoller criticized the musicals portrayal of hamilton as an idealist committed to democratic principles in contrast to what he characterized as the historical record of hamiltons reactionary anti-democratic politics and legacy.131 for example stoller cited hamilton as a leader involved in the newburgh conspiracy military coup plot against the continental congress in 1783 his development of a national financial system which in stollers view empowered the plutocratic elite and his use of military force indefinite detention and mass arrests against dissenters during the whiskey rebellion of 1791.131 in 2007, history writer william hogeland criticized chernows biography of hamilton on similar grounds in the boston Review.132  use in education  kqed news wrote of a number of intrepid us history teacherswho are harnessing the hamilton phenomenon to inspire their students.133 the cabinet rap battles provide a way to engage students with topics that have traditionally been considered uninteresting.133 an elective course for 11th and 12th graders on the musical hamilton was held at the ethical culture fieldston school in new York.133 kqed news added that is especially galvanizing for the student who believes that stories about 18th century america are distant and irrelevant as it shows the founding fathers were real humans with real feeling and real flaws rather than two-dimensional cutouts who devoted their lives to abstract principles.133 a high school teacher from the bronx noted his students were these songs the way they might sing the latest release from drake or Adele.134 one teacher focused on hamiltons ability to write his way out of trouble and toward a higher plane of existence writing is the clearest sign of scholarshipand the best way to rise up and alter your circumstance.135  hamiltons producers have made a pledge to allow 20,000 new york city public high school students from low-income families to get subsidized tickets to see hamilton on broadway by reducing their tickets to for students and the rockefeller foundation provided to further lower ticket prices to per student.136137 the gilder lehrman institute of american history created a study guide to accompany the student-ticket program.136137  the website educationworld writes that hamilton is praised for its revitalization of interest in civic education.138 northwestern university announced plans to offer course work in 2017 inspired by hamilton in history latino studies and interdisciplinary studies.139  in 2016, moraine valley community college started a hamilton appreciation movement straight outta hamilton hosting panels and events that talk about the musical itself and relate them to current events.140141  legacy and impact  bill  in 2015, the us department of the treasury announced a redesign to the bill with plans to replace hamilton with a then-undecided woman from american history because of hamiltons surging popularity almost exclusively due to the musical united states treasury secretary jack lew reversed the plans to replace hamiltons portrait instead deciding to replace andrew jackson with harriet tubman on the bill.142  hamilton the revolution  on april 12, 2016, miranda and jeremy mccarters book hamilton the revolution was released detailing hamiltons journey from an idea to a successful broadway musical it includes an inside look at not only alexander hamiltons revolution but the cultural revolution that permeates the show it also has footnotes from miranda and stories from behind the scenes of the show.143  hamiltons america  after premiering on the new york film festival on october 1, 2016, pbs great performances exhibited on october 21, 2016 the documentary hamiltons america directed by alex horwitz it even deeper into the creation of the show revealing mirandas process of absorbing and then adapting hamiltons epic story into groundbreaking musical theater further fleshing out the story is newly shot footage of the new york production with its original cast trips to historic locations such as mt vernon and valley forge with miranda and other cast members and a surprising range of interviews with prominent personalities experts politicians and musicians.144 the film featured interviews with american historians and hamilton authorities ron chernow and joanne b Freeman.145  2016 vice presidentelect pence controversy  following a performance on november 18, 2016, with vice president-elect mike pence in the audience brandon victor dixon addressed pence from the stage with a statement jointly written by the cast show creator lin-manuel miranda and producer jeffrey Seller.146 dixon began by quieting the audience and stated  vice president-elect pence we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us here at hamilton an american musical we really do we sirweare the diverse america who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us our planet our children our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights sir but we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our american values and to work on behalf of all of us all of us again we truly thank you truly for seeing this show this wonderful american story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors creeds and orientations.146  pence listened to the expression of concern about president-elect donald trumps upcoming administration and later expressed that he was not offended.147 however trump demanded an apology148 for what he described on twitter as the cast having Pence.149 this led to an online campaign called which became widely mocked as the show is already sold-out months in advance.150 trump was criticized by the washington post who noted the division between white and non-white america in the 2016 presidential election and suggested trump could have offered that he would be a president for all americansthat he would respect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed151 instead as presidential historian robert dallek expressed trumps twitter response was a act of divisiveness by an incoming president struggling to heal the nation after a bitter election,151 with the hamilton cast a proxy for those fearful of trumps policies and rhetoric jeffrey seller the shows lead producer said that while trump has not seen hamilton or inquired about tickets he is to attend.152  parodies  in april 2016, jeb the musical subtitled an american disappointment appeared on the internet with jeb bush in the place of alexander Hamilton,153154 with political figures like donald trump and chris christie holding supporting roles.155 a staged reading given as much preparation as jebs campaign was staged at northwestern university in june of that year.156 the parody was crowdsourced with contributions coming from a range of writers a number of writers were drawn from yale university boston university mcgill university and the university of michigan these writers met in a facebook group named Aesthetics.157  in 2016, gerard alessandrini the creator of forbidden broadway wrote the revue spamilton which premiered at the triad theater in new york and also played at the royal george theatre in chicago it parodies hamilton and other broadway shows and caricatures various broadway stars.158159  on october 12, 2016, the american sitcom modern family released the episode heights the episode features a scene where manny applies for college to do so he records a parody of hamilton as part of his application complete with rewritten lyrics to accompany to his own life it is revealed that most of the other applications are also hamilton parodies.160
