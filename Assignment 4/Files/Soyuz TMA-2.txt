lifeboat every six month with a visiting crew but not for crew exchange until the space shuttle columbia disaster the same was planned for soyuz TMA-2, a visiting crew consisting of commander gennady padalka and esa-astronaut pedro duque were to spend about one week at the station and then return with the previous soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft the third seat might have gone to the chilean klaus von storch as a chilean space agency chilena del espacio cosmonaut but even before the columbia disaster it looked like his flight would not happen and the seat would go to the russian cosmonaut oleg kotov or to deliver freight to the station  soyuz TMA-2 landing  during his stay on the station malenchenko became the first person to get married in space his bride was in texas where long distance
