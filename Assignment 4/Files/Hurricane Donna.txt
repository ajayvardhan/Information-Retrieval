the key largo national marine sanctuary by the hurricane.48 donna caused a significant negative impact on aquatic life in north florida bay marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion sports fishing in the area took a few months to recover juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about 60 miles offshore where they were subsequently captured by fishermen.49 a caspian tern was swept up the north american coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds to nova scotia which was witnessed four hours after the storm went by digby Neck.50  because of its devastating impacts and the high mortality associated with the hurricane the name was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was replaced by in 1964.51  see alsoedit
