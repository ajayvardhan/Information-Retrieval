from their temporary location on the stations pressurized mating adapter 1 prior to attachment to zvezda the panels are designed to shield zvezda from potential space debris impacts a total of 23 shields will eventually be installed onto the service Module.3  expedition 5  eva 2  korzun  sergei treshchev  26 august 2002  0527  26 august 2002  1048  5 hours 21 minutes  during expedition fives

japanese space agency materials exposure experiments housed on the outside of zvezda korzun and treshchev also installed devices on zvezda that will simplify the routing of tethers during future assembly spacewalks they improved future station amateur radio operations by adding two ham radio antennas on zvezda also korzun and treshchev installed the kromka hardware that was originally slated to take place during expedition fives first spacewalk kromka measures residue emissions from zvezdas jet thrusters.4  referencesedit  this article incorporatespublic domain material from websites or
