large bodies in elliptical orbits around their center of mass  an apsis plural apsides greek is an extreme point in an objects orbit the word comes via latin from greek and is cognate with apse.1 for elliptic orbits about a larger body there are two apsides named with the prefixes peri- meaning and ap- or apo- meaning from added to a reference to the thing being orbited  for a body orbiting the sun the point of least distance is the perihelion and the point of greatest distance is the aphelion  the terms become periastron and apastron when discussing orbits around other stars  for any satellite of earth including the moon the point of least distance is the perigee and greatest distance the apogee  for objects in lunar orbit the point of least distance is the pericynthion and the greatest distance the apocynthion perilune and apolune are also used.3  for any orbits around a center of mass there are the terms periapsis and apoapsis apapsis pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternatives  a straight line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse its greatest diameter for a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line at one of the two foci of the ellipse when one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus however whether or not this is the case both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the systems center of mass with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses historically in geocentric systems apsides were measured from the center of the earth however in the case of the moon the center of mass of the earthmoon system or earthmoon barycenter as the common focus of both the moons and earths orbits about each other is about 75 of the way from earths center to its surface  in orbital mechanics the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body however in the case of spacecraft the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the

distances between an orbit and its primary the radius of the central body has to be added and conversely  the arithmetic mean of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi-major axis a the geometric mean of the two distances is the length of the semi-minor axis b  the geometric mean of the two limiting speeds is  which is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius is  terminologyedit  the words and are often seen although periapsisapoapsis are preferred in technical usage  various related terms are used for other celestial objects the and and forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix is occasionally used for jupiter while has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the form is commonly used as a generic approach to planet term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis were used when referring to the Moon.4 regarding black holes the term periapomelasma a greek root was used by physicist geoffrey a landis in 1998 before periaponigricon a latin appeared in the scientific literature in 2002.5  terminology graphedit  the following suffixes are added to peri- and apo- to form the terms for the nearest and

and removed 2017 how and when to remove this template message  for the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earths eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycles  on a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22,000 to 26,000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession is closely related to the precession of the axis  currently the earth reaches perihelion in early january approximately 14 days after the december solstice at perihelion the earths center is about 69999832900000000000.98329 astronomical units or 147,098,070km from the suns center  the earth reaches aphelion currently in early july approximately 14 days after the june solstice the aphelion distance between the earths and suns centers is currently about 70111520976511193971.01671AU or 152,097,700km  astronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the vernal equinox not in terms of days and hours but rather as an angle of orbital displacement the so-called longitude of the pericenter for the orbit of the earth this is called the longitude of perihelion and in 2000 was about 282.895. by the year 2010, this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283.067.6  the dates and times of the perihelions and aphelions for several past and future years are listed in the following table7  year  perihelion
