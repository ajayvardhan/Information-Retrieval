advection  in physics engineering and earth sciences advection is the transport of a substance by bulk motion the properties of that substance are carried with it generally the majority of the advected substance is a fluid the properties that are carried with the advected substance are conserved properties such as energy an example of advection is the transport of pollutants or silt in a river by bulk water flow downstream another commonly advected quantity is energy or enthalpy here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy such as water or air in general any substance or conserved extensive quantity can be advected by a fluid that can hold or contain the quantity or substance  during advection a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk motion the fluids motion is described mathematically as a vector field and the transported material is described by a scalar field showing its distribution over space advection requires currents in the fluid and so cannot happen in rigid solids it does not include transport of substances by molecular diffusion  advection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of convection which is the combination of advective transport and diffusive transport  in meteorology and physical oceanography advection often refers to the transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean such as heat humidity moisture or salinity advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the hydrological cycle  contents  1

technically convection covers the sum of transport both by diffusion and by advection advective transport describes the movement of some quantity via the bulk flow of a fluid in a river or pipeline.12  meteorologyedit  in meteorology and physical oceanography advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean such as heat humidity or salinity and convection generally refers to vertical transport advection advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds convection and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the hydrological cycle  other quantitiesedit  the advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a probability density function at each point although accounting for diffusion is more difficultcitation needed  mathematics of advectionedit  the advection equation is the partial differential equation that governs the motion of a conserved scalar field as it is advected by a known velocity vector field it is derived using the scalar fields conservation law together with gausss theorem and taking the infinitesimal limit  one easily visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river as the river flows ink will move downstream in a via advection as the waters movement itself transports the ink if added to a lake without significant bulk water flow the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a diffusive manner which is not advection note that as it moves downstream the of ink will also spread via diffusion the sum of these processes is called convection  the advection equationedit  in cartesian coordinates the advection operator is   where is the velocity field and is the del operator that cartesian coordinates are used here  the advection equation for a conserved quantity described by a scalar field is expressed mathematically by a continuity equation  where is the divergence operator and again is the velocity vector field frequently it is assumed that the flow is incompressible that is the velocity field satisfies  and is said to be solenoidal if this is so the above equation can be rewritten as  in particular if the flow is steady then  which shows that is constant along a streamline hence so doesnt vary in time  if a vector quantity as a magnetic field is being advected by the solenoidal velocity field the advection equation above becomes  here is a vector field instead of the scalar field  solving the equationedit  a simulation of the advection equation where u t cos t is solenoidal  the advection equation is not simple to solve numerically the system is a hyperbolic partial differential equation and interest typically centers on discontinuous solutions are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle  even with one space dimension and a constant velocity field the system remains difficult to simulate the equation becomes  where is the scalar field being advected and is the component of the vector  treatment of the advection operator in the incompressible navier stokes equationsedit  according to Zang,3 numerical simulation can be aided by considering the skew symmetric form for the advection operator  where  and is the same as above  since skew symmetry implies only imaginary eigenvalues this form reduces the up and blocking often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities Boyd4.  using vector calculus identities these operators can also be expressed in other ways available in more software packages for more coordinate systems  this form also makes visible that the skew symmetric operator introduces error when the velocity field diverges solving the advection equation by numerical methods is very challenging and there is a large scientific literature about this  see alsoedit  conservation equation  convection  courant number  pclet number  overshoot  del  earths atmosphere  diffusion
