historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on july 6, a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa moving westward the disturbance gradually organized until July10, at which point convection became more concentrated and it is estimated tropical depression five formed in the central tropical atlantic that evening.1 late on July11, it strengthened and was named tropical storm emily initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the greater antilles emily instead moved almost due west toward the windward islands remaining a moderate tropical storm the storm languished while moving quickly west and struggled with maintaining its form contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind hurricane dennis had made portions of the caribbean sea warmer,2 and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development late on July13, emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing tobago and entering the eastern caribbean on July14, emily made landfall in northern grenada with 90mph winds.1  the intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storms central pressure as it entered the southeastern caribbean sea a region typically unfavorable for intensification hurricane emilys winds increased in reaction briefly bringing the storm to category 4 strength early on July15. during the day the storms strength fluctuated greatly dropping to a Category2 storm and then rebuilding to Category4. on July16, emily strengthened considerably making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of july with peak winds of 160mph the earliest known category 5 in the atlantic basin initially at this point emily was thought to have peaked as a Category4 storm but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a Category5 hurricane.1 the storm weakened slightly as it continued westward and remained a Category4 while passing south of jamaica and on July17, the cayman islands hurricane emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest weakening somewhat but remaining at Category4 until striking cozumel just before mainland landfall at playa del carmen at 0630UTC on July18. sustained winds were 135mph and the eyewall passed directly over cozumel  hurricane emily making landfall on July18, 2005  the center of circulation emerged over the gulf of mexico later that morning.1 passage over land disrupted the hurricanes center of circulation and it had weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75mph however several hours over the warm waters of the western gulf provided the energy needed for emily to regenerate and by midnight wind speeds were increasing the increase in wind speed stalled but the storm continued to become better organized emily started to show very symmetrical outflow but the hurricanes strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center however the outer wind radii subsided in the end and the inner core prevailed the result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core on the evening of July19. the pressure dropped about 30millibars and the winds went from 90mph to more than 125mph all within a few hours.1  further strengthening was expected by forecasters but did not come.1 the storms motion slowed and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast the storm made landfall around 1100UTC on July20 near san fernando in tamaulipas the storm had sustained winds of 125mph Category3 on the
