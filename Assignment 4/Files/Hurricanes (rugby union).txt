called the hurricanes the teams first coach was former all black frank oliver while bull allen was named as captain their first match played at palmerston north showgrounds against the auckland blues was the first ever super rugby match they lost it 3628. the team performed below expectations in the inaugural year of the competition and finished ninth in 1997 the team made the semi-finals losing in canberra to the act brumbies however the consistent form shown during this season would not be seen again for many years  expect the unexpected 19982002edit  following their 1997 season the hurricanes failed to qualify for the semi-finals until 2003. despite this they were still known for the attacking nature of their backline that included the all blacks stars tana umaga and christian cullen the team played with flair and could score at any moment whatever their position on the field giving rise to the teams catch cry of the unexpected however the team struggled for consistent performances and at crunch time in matches leading to patchy form and results  after the 1999 world cup jonah lomus contract with the nzru expired he was linked to many clubs around the world in rugby league as well as union and also the nfls dallas Cowboys.3 on 23 november 1999 it was announced that the winger had resigned from the nzru and agreed terms with the wellington rugby union despite a reported a 1.1million offer by Bristol.34 the move to the wellington union meant he could be included in the protected group of players for the hurricanes  the hurricanes also opened 2000 with a new stadium the highlights of that year included the victory over eventual champions the crusaders 4129, in front of a packed house at the end of the season the still had a mathematical chance of making the semis and only had to beat the bulls to stay in contention however the hurricanes played one of their worst games of the year losing the match to one of the worst performing teams at that point in the competitions history and lost the possibility of qualifying for the semi-finals the team finished eighth on the table  despite the wellington lions most of the hurricanes squad were chosen from winning the 2000 NPC,5 the hurricanes finished ninth in the final standings in 2001 one worse than the year before another ninth placing in 2002 resulted in graham mourie who had led the team since 2000, resigning.6  new era since 2003edit  this section needs expansion with information from 2006 onward you can help by adding to it 2011  the hurricanes playing the highlanders at westpac stadium in 2006  in spite of reports that colin cooper the then crusaders assistant-coach had said he was yet ready to jump ship and wanted to stay with the south island franchise,7 the hurricanes were able to lure him away from the champions and made him their head coach for the 2003 season  cooper along with newly appointed captain tana umaga helped to mould the inconsistent and ill-disciplined hurricanes into one of the top teams in the competition.8 2003 was the beginning of a new era for the hurricanes as they reached the semi-finals for just the second time in their history on the back of a strong seven-game winning streak mid-season their success came partly with the break-out year for mid-fielder maa nonu his strong performances and partnership with captain tana umaga pushed out former all black pita alatini and saw him score six tries en route to the all black squad the team also benefited from the steady hand of david holwell at first five-eighth and an improving and mobile forward pack hurricanes stalwart christian cullen would leave new zealand shores for irish club munster after his omission from the all blacks 2003 world cup squad despite scoring eight tries during the season  all black great jonah lomu was left out of the 2004 squad due to a life-threatening illness that would eventually result in a kidney transplant he would never again play for the hurricanes  the majority of the team was retained for 2005.9 including new centre conrad Smith.10 the hurricanes came back in 2005 to the form that saw them make the playoffs two years prior former new zealand colt flyhalf jimmy gopperth was the real of the season scoring 139 points which helped offset the departure of david holwell to ireland the hurricanes had tried to sign australian playmaker brock james who had starred the previous npc season for Taranaki11 and the blues and young star luke mcalister indicated that he would like to play in Wellington.12 with both daniel carter and aaron mauger at the crusaders capable of playing first five-eighth the team also made an attempt to lure andrew mehrtens to wellington without success  in 2006 two new teams entered the competition the bloemfontein-based cheetahs from south africa and the perth-based western force from australia creating the super 14. rodney sooialo was appointed captain of the hurricanes to succeed former all black captain tana Umaga.13 the team won all but four matches they made their first super rugby final but lost to the crusaders in a match played under thick fog following the match there was an incident in a nightclub involving chris masoe and tana umaga the club finances benefitted from on-pitch success with NZ1.36million profit on its 2006 turnover of NZ7.44million.  the hurricanes returned to the semi-finals in both 2008 and 2009, however were unable to capture the same success in subsequent seasons.14 2011 saw the arrival of mark hammett as coach and the departure of andrew hore maa nonu and piri weepu  the hurricanes finished 11th in the 2013 super rugby season  2015 saw the hurricanes finish first in the regular season topping the table with 66 points and a win-loss record of 142 in round robin play the hurricanes picked up the new zealand conference trophy after beating the highlanders after beating the brumbies in the semi-final the hurricanes lost the final against the highlanders 2114. it was the final super rugby match for conrad smith maa nonu and jeremy thrush all hurricanes that have played over 100 caps  on 8 december 2015, rugby world cup-winning hooker dane coles was named captain for the 2016 season rugby world cup-winning halfback tj perenara was named as vice-captain.15  2016 was a big year for the hurricanes finishing first overall on the points table despite sitting in 7th going into the final round of the regular season this saw them go into the quarter finals against the sharks winning 41-0 at westpac stadium they carried on to the semi finals playing the chiefs and winning 25-9 at westpac stadium the hurricanes played the lions in the final winning the game 20-3 at westpac stadium this was the first time in super rugby history that the hurricanes won the title it was victor vitos final and 100th game for the hurricanes  honoursedit  super 1214  runners-up  2006  playoff appearances  1997, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009  super rugby  new

franchise signing over its allegiance to the Chiefs.16  groundsedit  the hurricanes play the majority of their home matches at the 34,500 capacity westpac stadium on wellingtons waterfront the stadium is affectionately known as the cake-tin outside of wellington due to its shape it was opened in 2000 to replace athletic park where the team had been previously based central energy trust arena in palmerston north and mclean park in napier have also played host to hurricanes matches  in the initial years of the competition the hurricanes played once or occasionally twice away from their wellington base depending on whether they had five or six games per year such a policy was welcomed given the large geographic area that the team was drawn from however in recent years the team has seldom ventured from wellington despite the expansion to 14 and now 15 teams meaning two additional games per year  palmerston north  wellington  napier  central energy trust arena  westpac stadium

from the nzru to operate the club.17  whilst the nzru retains ownership of the team as well as control of the contracts of the players and head coach the licensee is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations hurricanes investment ltd partnership is a joint venture between the wellington rugby football union owning 50 per cent of shares with the remaining 50 per cent held by a
