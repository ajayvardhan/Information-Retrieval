kevin catchpole from popmatters gave the album six out of ten discs commenting that disappointing thing is how slight moments of innovation appear for fleeting seconds only then disappear into the ether it suggests a band that is capable of so much more if only it wanted to try.11 andy argyrakis of ccm magazine rated the album three stars out of five remarking how the release contains of uplifting and contemplative lyrics yet their piano pop surfaces on occasion there seems to be a gravitation toward gang-styled choruses and massive electronic beats which sometimes succeed but periodically appear too derivative of todays top 40.10  james christopher monger from allmusic gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars indicating how that begins innocuously enough with my hand a straight-up anthem generator-spawned arm-waver that pairs a safe circular entirely familiar chord progression with a melody that returns the favor description that applies to most if not all of the ten songs that follow before unleashing the albums first single dont die a digitized boot-stomper that leans hard on the kings of leonblack keys side of the fray spectrum flirtations with disco it away and pure killers-cloned electro-pop follow but the fray never sound as comfortable as they do when theyre dishing out relatively generic yet undeniably impassioned slabs of springsteen train goo goo dolls and coldplay-inspired open-highway treacle like last days and this Goes.9  track listingedit  all songs produced by stuart price dont die produced by price and ryan tedder  no  title
