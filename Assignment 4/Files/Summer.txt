solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons,12 but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice the time of maximal insolation or on the traditional date of june 21. a variable seasonal lag means that the meteorological center of the season which is based on average temperature patterns occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation.3 the meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of june july and august in the northern hemisphere and the months of december january and february in the southern hemisphere.45

definition of 1 june  days continue to lengthen from equinox to solstice and summer days progressively shorten after the solstice so meteorological summer encompasses the build-up to the longest day and a diminishing thereafter with summer having many more hours of daylight than spring reckoning by hours of daylight alone summer solstice marks the midpoint not the beginning of the seasons midsummer takes place over the shortest night of the year which is the summer solstice or on a nearby date that varies with tradition  where a seasonal lag of half a season or more is common reckoning based on astronomical markers is shifted half a season.6 by this method in north america summer is the period from the summer solstice 20 or 21 june in the northern hemisphere to the autumn equinox.789  reckoning by cultural festivals the summer season in the united states is commonly regarded as beginning on memorial day weekend last weekend in may and ending on labor day weekend first
