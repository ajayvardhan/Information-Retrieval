hurricane wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall additionally it made the third most intense atlantic hurricane landfall a cape verde-type hurricane that formed on august 13, 2007, dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern atlantic ocean through the saint lucia channel and into the caribbean it strengthened into a major hurricanenb 1 reaching Category5 status on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of jamaica on august 20. the storm made landfall on the yucatn peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm it crossed the peninsula and emerged into the bay of campeche weakened but still a hurricane it strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near tecolutla in the mexican state of veracruz on august 22. dean drifted to the northwest weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern united states dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure only behind cyclone george in the australian region and tied with felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds  the hurricanes intense winds waves rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US1.66billion. first impacting the islands of the lesser antilles deans path through the caribbean devastated agricultural crops particularly those of martinique and jamaica upon reaching mexico hurricane dean was a Category5 storm but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the caribbean islands it passed as a Category2 storm  through the affected regions clean up and repair took months to complete donations solicited by international aid organizations joined national funds in clearing roads rebuilding houses and replanting destroyed crops in jamaica where the damage was worst banana production did not return to pre-storm levels for over a year mexicos tourist industry too took almost a year to rebuild its damaged cruise ship infrastructure  dean was the first hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since hurricane andrew on august 24, 1992.2 deans Category5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than andrews even though dean was much larger

history of hurricane dean  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on august 11, 2007, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa,3 and encountering favorable conditions,4 quickly developed into tropical depression four about 520miles west-southwest of cape verde on august 13.5 the depression moved briskly westward,6 and was upgraded to tropical storm dean at 1500UTC on august 14.7 the storms intensity continued to build8 although dry air and cooler air inflow from the north were slowing structural development ragged bands formed on august 159 and the formation of a partial eyewall was observed later that day.10  image of hurricane dean at category 5 hurricane strength on august 18, 2007  intensification continued11 and the storm was upgraded to hurricane dean at 5am edt utc august 16.12 the deep-layered ridge to the north continued to steer the system west towards the caribbean Sea.13 the storm quickly strengthened to a Category2 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane Scale.1415 the storms development slowed slightly but16 a reconnaissance aircraft discovered a closed eyewall on august 17 as the storm passed through the lesser Antilles.17 data from the aircraft indicated that hurricane dean had strengthened to a Category3 hurricane18 and its trailing bands were still over the lesser Antilles.19 during the evening of august 17, dean strengthened into a Category4 hurricane20 and continued to steadily grow in both size and intensity through the night.21 on august 18 the presence of a double eyewall was noted,22 indicating an eyewall replacement cycle and causing short term fluctuations in intensity.23 these fluctuations did not affect the storms well defined satellite presentation.22 operationally dean was thought to have only been a Category4 on the 18th, but post-storm analysis shows that dean had become a 165miles per hour Category5 that day dean weakened very slightly on the morning of august 19 as it finished the eyewall replacement cycle and began to interact with the island of Jamaica24  hurricane dean passed south of jamaica on the evening of august 1925 and began to intensify again that night.26 its eyewall replacement cycle was thought to be completed.27 a concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of august 20, but did not last long the hurricane still tracking west-northwest under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered high pressure system to the north moved over waters with extremely high heat content and began to strengthen once again.28 the eyewall became even better defined during the day,29 and at 835pm ast on august 20 august 21, utc dean restrengthened to a category 5 hurricane the highest rating on the saffirsimpson hurricane Scale.30 it made landfall as a Category5 storm in quintana roos costa maya region 40mi northeast of the border between mexico and belize and weakened on its way over land reemerging on the western side of yucatn as a Category1 storm.31 dean regained strength as it crossed the gulf of mexico and made its second landfall as a Category2 storm on august 22, at around 1130 cdt near tecolutla veracruz to the south of tuxpan where after it moved westward losing strength and disintegrating over central mexico a small remnant circulation reached the pacific Ocean,32 eventually moving northwestward around an anticyclone roughly parallel to the mexican coast and finally back inland over the southwestern united States,33 where it completely dissipated on august 27.34  preparationsedit  hurricane deans smooth and well-predicted track gave unusually advance warning to all of the nations in its path and allowed them time to prepare for the storms impact.35 because of

hurricane through the saint lucia channel on august 17.17 it moved briskly between the lesser antillean islands of st lucia and Martinique,17 with its storm surge and rain bands reaching every island in the chain.35 damage was most severe in martinique where total damage was estimated at 400million and three indirect deaths while nearby guadaloupe suffered 400million of damage in st lucia damage was mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at US18million.35  martinique experienced 75mph winds with gusts to 105mph the torrential rainfall which reached 332mm caused flooding throughout

gusts of 200mph were reported the states tourist cities of cancn and cozumel were spared the worst of the storm but it wreaked havoc in the state capital chetumal 40mi south of landfall causing significant flooding.126 the town of majahual which had a population of 200, was totally destroyed by the storm storm surge and high winds severely damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings127 and had the strength to crumple steel girders.35 the waves tore away portions of the concrete docks at costa mayas popular cruise port and the harbor was closed to cruise ships for almost a year.127128 despite the storms tremendous intensity not a single death was attributed to its initial landfall owing mostly to the governments thorough preparations and forecasters ample warning.129130  following the second landfall on the veracruz coast two rivers in the mountains of the state of hidalgo overflowed and rain fell as far west as the pacific coast veracruz governor fidel herrera said there was

desert on the morning of august 27. las vegas received a daily record of 0.58in of rain with flash flooding and minor damage.146  aftermathedit  this royal caribbean ship freedom of the seas was the first cruise ship to visit jamaica after hurricane dean it called into ocho rios on august 22.  despite deans significant damage it did not have severe effects on infrastructure and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the western caribbean in anticipation of hurricane deans passage though by august 27 all were back on schedule except those with damaged ports in belize and the yucatn the lesser antilles and the greater antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines as their ports opened within days.128  lesser antillesedit  main article effects of hurricane dean in the lesser antilles  although hurricane dean was only a Category2 hurricane when its northern eyewall passed over martinique the wind and widespread flooding destroyed 70 of the islands sugar cane crop and all of its banana crop valued at 400million or 10 of GDP.147 remarkably the tourism industry withstood the storm well only a few hotels reported minor damage and the airport opened the day after the hurricane.128148149 other than landscaping damage all of the islands hotels were fully functional by the end of August.128  the french overseas minister christian estrozy and french prime minister francois fillon visited french caribbean island to assess the storms damage they estimated the storm left 600people homeless the brevity of their visit prompted some of martiniques famous writers including edouard glissant patrick chamoiseau and raphael confiant to write an open letter airing their
