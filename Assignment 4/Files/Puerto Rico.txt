archipelago which is now puerto rico is not well known unlike other indigenous cultures in the new world maya and inca which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies scant artifacts and evidence remain of the puerto ricos indigenous population scarce archaeological findings and early spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them the first comprehensive book on the history of puerto rico was written by fray igo abbad y lasierra in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first spaniards landed on the island.40  the first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years.41 an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the ferro man which was dated to around 2000 BC.42 the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.41  the igneri tribe migrated to puerto rico between 120 and 400AD from the region of the orinoco river in northern south america the arcaico and igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries  between the 7th and 11th centuries the tano culture developed on the island by approximately 1000AD, it had become dominant at the time of columbus arrival an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 tano amerindians led by the cacique ageyban inhabited the island they called it boriken meaning great land of the valiant and noble Lord.43 the natives lived in small villages each led by a cacique they subsisted by hunting and fishing done generally by men as well as by the womens gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit this lasted until columbus arrived in 1493.4445  spanish colony  further information captaincy general of puerto rico  juan ponce de len de campos valladolid spain puerto ricos first governor  conquest and early settlement  when columbus arrived in puerto rico during his second voyage on november 19, 1493, the island was inhabited by the tano they called it borikn in spanish transliteration columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of st john the baptist having reported the findings of his first travel columbus brought with him this time a letter from king Ferdinand46 empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the spanish empire and the christian faith juan ponce de len a lieutenant under columbus founded the first spanish settlement caparra on august 8, 1508. he later served as the first governor of the islandf eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico and san juan became the name of the main tradingshipping port  at the beginning of the 16th century the spanish people began to colonize the island despite the laws of burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population some tano indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization the population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of european infectious diseasesghijk  colonization the habsburgs  in 1520, king charles i of spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining tano population by that time the tano people were few in number.54 enslaved africans had already begun to compensate for the native labor loss but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony other nearby islands like cuba saint-domingue and guadeloupe attracted more of the slave trade than puerto rico probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the atlantic slave trade.55  from the beginning of the country the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses primarily in coastal ports and cities where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down with no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements particularly around san juan also forming lasting afro-creole communities meanwhile in the islands interior there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy this mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and in relative isolation set the pattern for what later would be known as the puerto rican jbaro culture by the end of the 16th century the spanish empire was diminishing and in the face of increasing raids from european competitors the colonial administration throughout the americas fell into a mentality imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the kings silver-laden atlantic fleet to the iberian peninsula san juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the atlantic by its powerful trade winds west indies convoys linked spain to the island sailing between cdiz and the spanish west indies the colonys seat of government was on the forested islet of san juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the spanish caribbean earning the name of the city the islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls such as la fortaleza castillo san felipe del morro and castillo san cristbal designed to protect the population and the strategic port of san juan from the raids of the spanish european competitors  hendricksz 1625 attack on san juan puerto rico  in 1625, in the battle of san juan the dutch commander boudewijn hendricksz tested the defenses limits like no one else before learning from francis drakes previous failures here he circumvented the cannons of the castle of san felipe del morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the san juan bay he then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the morros moat and high battlements historians consider this event the worst attack on san juan though the dutch set the village on fire they failed to conquer the morro and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until hendricksz deemed the cause lost hendrickszs expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy constructions of defenses for the san cristbal hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the morros artillery urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in spanish hands  late colonial period  hacienda la fortuna a sugar mill complex in puerto rico painted by francisco oller in 1885 museum  during the late 16th and early 17th centuries spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland north central and south american colonies with the advent of the lively bourbon dynasty in spain in the 1700s, the island of puerto rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention more roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities and coastal settlements like arecibo mayaguez and ponce began acquiring importance of their own separate from san juan by the end of the 18th century merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the mercantilist system which turned each colony solely toward the european metropole and limited contact with other nations us ships came to surpass spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the islands natural resources slavers which had made but few stops on the island before began selling more enslaved africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations the increasing number of atlantic wars in which the caribbean islands played major roles like the war of jenkins ear the seven years war and the atlantic revolutions ensured puerto ricos growing esteem in madrids eyes on april 17, 1797, sir ralph abercromby fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,00013,000 men,56 which included german soldiers and royal marines and 60 to 64 ships fierce fighting continued for the next days with spanish troops both sides suffered heavy losses on sunday april 30 the british ceased their attack and began their retreat from san juan by the time independence movements in the larger spanish colonies gained success new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in puerto rico helping to tilt the islands political balance toward the crown  the 16th-century fort castillo san felipe del morro in san juan puerto rico  in 1809, to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the european peninsular war the supreme central junta based in cdiz recognized puerto rico as an overseas province of spain this gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened spanish parliament cortes with equal representation to mainland iberian mediterranean islands and atlantic maritime spanish provinces islandscitation needed  ramn power y giralt the first spanish parliamentary representative from the island of puerto rico died after serving a three-year term in the cortes these parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814, and again from 1820 to 1823. they were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by ferdinand vii immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the islands ethnic european population and economy and expanded the spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the islandcitation needed  minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years with the revolt planned and organized by marcos xiorro in 1821 being the most important even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of puerto ricos folklore.57  politics of liberalism  the flag flown by fidel vlez and his men during the de yauco revolt  in the early 19th century puerto rico spawned an independence movement that due to harsh persecution by the spanish authorities convened in the island of st thomas the movement was largely inspired by the ideals of simn bolvar in establishing a united provinces of new granada and venezuela that included puerto rico and cuba among the influential members of this movement were brigadier general antonio valero de bernab and mara de las mercedes barbudo the movement was discovered and governor miguel de la torre had its members imprisoned or exiled.58  with the increasingly rapid growth of independent former spanish colonies in the south and central american states in the first part of the 19th century the spanish crown considered puerto rico and cuba of strategic importance to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies the spanish crown revived the royal decree of graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants mainly spaniards settled on the island in the period up until the american conquest printed in three languagesspanish english and frenchit was intended to also attract non-spanish europeans with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the crown hundreds of non spanish families mainly from corsica france germany ireland italy and scotland also immigrated to the island.59  free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and allegiance to the roman catholic Church.59 the offer was very successful and european immigration continued even after 1898. puerto rico still receives spanish and european immigration  the lares revolutionary flag  poverty and political estrangement with spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as grito de lares it began in the rural town of lares but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of san sebastin  leaders of this independence movement included ramn emeterio betances considered the of the puerto rican independence movement and other political figures such as segundo ruiz belvis slavery was abolished in puerto rico in 1873, provisions for periods of apprenticeship.60  abolition park in ponce puerto rico  leaders of grito de lares went into exile in new york city many joined the puerto rican revolutionary committee founded on december 8, 1895, and continued their quest for puerto rican independence in 1897, antonio mattei lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in yauco organized another uprising which became known as the intentona de yauco they raised what they called the puerto rican flag which was adopted as the national flag the local conservative political factions opposed independence rumors of the planned event spread to the local spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to spanish colonial rule.61  in 1897, luis muoz rivera and others persuaded the liberal spanish government to agree to grant limited self-government to the island by royal decree in the autonomic charter including a bicameral legislature.62 in 1898, puerto ricos first but short-lived quasi-autonomous government was organized as an province of spain this bilaterally agreed-upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the king of spain who held the power to annul any legislative decision and a partially elected parliamentary structure in february governor-general manuel macas inaugurated the new government under the autonomic charter general elections were held in march and the new government began to function on july 17, 1898.636465  american era  main article puerto rican campaign  in 1890, captain alfred thayer mahan a member of the navy war board and leading us strategic thinker published a book titled the influence of sea power upon history in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the british royal navy part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the caribbean which would serve as coaling and naval stations they would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the isthmus of panama to allow easier passage of ships between the atlantic and pacific oceans.66  the first company of puerto ricans enlisted in the us army 1899  william h seward the former secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson had also stressed the importance of building a canal in honduras nicaragua or panama he suggested that the united states annex the dominican republic and purchase puerto rico and cuba the us senate did not approve his annexation proposal and spain rejected the us offer of 160 million dollars for puerto rico and Cuba.66  since 1894, the united states naval war college had been developing contingency plans for a war with spain by 1896, the us office of naval intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in puerto rican waters except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named isle of pines renamed as isla de la juventud a recommendation dropped in later planning plans developed for attacks on spanish territories were intended as support operations against spains forces in and around Cuba.67 recent research suggests that the us did consider puerto rico valuable as a naval station and recognized that it and cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar a valuable commercial commodity which the united states lacked,68 before the

the jones act which granted puerto ricans born on or after april 25, 1898, us citizenship.75 opponents which included all of the puerto rican house of delegates who voted unanimously against it said

of us troops in the puerto rican campaign of the spanishamerican war until then celebrated as an annual puerto rico holiday  a shantytown along the martin pea channel  puerto rico adopted the name of estado libre asociado de puerto rico free state of puerto Rico94, officially translated into english as commonwealth for its body politic.m9596 united states congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of puerto rican life including citizenship the currency the postal service foreign policy military defense communications labor relations the environment commerce finance health and welfare and many others.97  during the 1950s and 1960s, puerto rico experienced rapid industrialization due in large part to operacin manos a la obra bootstrap an offshoot of fdrs new deal it was intended to transform puerto ricos economy from agriculture-based to manufacturing-based to provide more jobs puerto rico has become a major tourist destination as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing.98  referendums on statehood or independence  four referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the political status the 2012 referendum showed a majority of the voters in favor of a change in status with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum creating confusion as to the voters true desire congress decided to ignore the vote.99100  the first three plebiscites provided voters with three options statehood free association and independence the puerto rican status referendum 2017 in june 2017 was going to offer only two options statehood and independencefree association however a letter from the donald trump administration recommended adding the commonwealth the current status in the plebiscite the option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and no had won the trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the department of justice as well as adding a territorial status option.101 while 97 percent voted in favor of statehood the turnout was low only some 23 percent voted.102 after the ballots were counted the justice department was non-committal the justice department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the rossell government chose not to do so after the outcome was announced the department told the associated press that it had reviewed or approved the ballots language.103  former governor anbal acevedo vil is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the us or for puerto rico economic identity and cultural reasons he pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low and suggests that a different type of mutually-beneficial relationship should be found.104  if the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities.105 the agreement might cover topics such as the role of the us military in puerto rico the use of the us currency free trade between the two entities and whether puerto ricans would be us citizens.106  the three current free associated states islands micronesia and palau use the american dollar receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country their citizens are allowed to work in the us and serve in its military.105  governor ricardo rossell is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to our 500-year-old colonial dilemma colonialism is not an option its a civil rights issue 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy he told the news media.107 benefits of statehood include an additional billion per year in federal funds the right to vote in presidential elections higher social security and medicare benefits and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy the latter is currently prohibited.108  statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection according to the government development bank this might be the only solution to the debt crisis congress has the power to vote to allow chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood but in late 2015 there was very little support in the house for this concept other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and medicaid funding the right to vote in presidential elections and the higher minimum wage.109  subsequent to the 2017 referendum puerto ricos legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress.110111 in spite of the outcome of the referendum and the so-called tennessee plan action by the united states congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of puerto rico under the territorial clause of the united states Constitution.108  united nations special committee on decolonization  since 1953, the un has been considering the political status of puerto rico and how to assist it in achieving or in 1978, the special committee determined that a relationship existed between the us and puerto Rico.112  the uns special committee on decolonization has often referred to puerto rico as a in its reports because internationally the people of puerto rico are often considered to be a caribbean nation with their own national identity.113114115 most recently in a june 2016 report the special committee called for the united states to expedite the process to allow self-determination in puerto rico more specifically the group called on the united states to expedite a process that would allow the people of puerto rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence allow the puerto rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs including unemployment marginalization insolvency and poverty.116  international status  on november 27, 1953, shortly after the establishment of the commonwealth the general assembly of the united nations approved resolution 748, removing puerto ricos classification as a non-self-governing territory the general assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of puerto Rico.117118  according to the white house task force on puerto ricos political status in its december 21, 2007 report the us in its written submission to the un in 1953, never represented that congress could not change its relationship with puerto rico without the territorys consent.119 it stated that the us justice department in 1959 reiterated that congress held power over puerto rico pursuant to the territorial Clause120 of the us Constitution.119  in 1993 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.121 in a 1996 report on a puerto rico status political bill the us house committee on resources stated ricos current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under resolution 1541 three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as national independence free association based on separate sovereignty or full integration with another nation on the basis of equality the report concluded that puerto rico remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of association with the united states as that status is defined under united states law or international practice that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the us congress and that us congress can also withdraw the us citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose.122123 the application of the us constitution to puerto rico is limited by the insular cases  in 2006,124 2007,125 2009,126 2010,127 and 2011128 the united nations special committee on decolonization passed resolutions calling on the united states to expedite a process would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence,129 and to release all puerto rican political prisoners in us prisons to clean up decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of vieques and culebra to the people of puerto rico to perform a probe into us human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing by the fbi of pro-independence leader filiberto ojeda rios  21st

and invalidated ballots counted alongside the 1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non-territorial alternatives under puerto rico law these ballots are not considered cast votes and are therefore not reflected in the final tally.130  on july 15, 2009, the united nations special committee on decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the government of the united states to expedite a process that would allow the puerto rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.131  on april 29, 2010, the us house voted 223169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for puerto ricos self-determination allowing puerto rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth or to have a different political status if puerto ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth the government of puerto rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified if puerto ricans voted to have a different political status a second referendum would determine whether puerto rico would become a us state an independent country or a sovereign nation associated with the us that would not be subject to the territorial clause of the united states Constitution.132 during the house debate a fourth option to retain its present form of commonwealth referred to as status quo political status was added as an option in the second plebiscite.132133  immediately following us house passage hr 2499 was sent to the us senate where it was given two formal readings and referred to the senate committee on energy and natural resources on december 22, 2010, the 111th united states congress adjourned without any senate vote on H.R.2499, killing the bill.134  the latest task force report was released on march 11, 2011. the report suggested a two-plebiscite process including a plebiscite that requires the people of puerto rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the united states via statehood or commonwealth or wish to be independent independence or free association if continuing to be part of the united states were chosen in the first plebiscite a second vote would be taken between statehood and Commonwealth.135  on june 14, 2011, president barack obama to support clear decision by the people of puerto rico on statehood.136 that same month the united nations special committee on decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by cubas delegate on june 20, 2011, calling on the united states to expedite a process would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.129  on november 6, 2012, a two-question referendum took place simultaneous with the general elections.137137138 the first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the us constitution the second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved statehood independence or free association.139 for the first question 54 percent voted against the current commonwealth status for the second question 61.16 voted for statehood 33.34 for a sovereign free associated state and 5.49 for independence.140  there were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots which are not reflected in the final tally as they are not considered cast votes under puerto rico law.130 on december 11, 2012, puerto ricos legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the president and the us congress action on november 6, 2012 plebiscite results.141 but on april 10, 2013, with the issue still being widely debated the white house announced that it will seek million to hold another referendum this next one being the first puerto rican status referendum to be financed by the us federal government.142  in december 2015, the us government submitted a brief as amicus curiae to the us supreme court related to the case commonwealth of puerto rico v sanchez valle the us government official position is that the us constitution does not contemplate territories that the court has consistently recognized that is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself and a us territory has independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state that is because government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states congresss plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self-government whereby local officials administer a territorys internal affairs.143  on june 9, 2016, in commonwealth of puerto rico vs sanchez valle an 62 majority of the supreme court of the united states determined that puerto rico is a territory and lacks Sovereignty.144  on june 30, 2016, the president of the united states of america signed a new law approved by us congress hr 5278 promesa establishing a control board over the puerto rico government this board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations in particular the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal governments constitutional power to all needful rules and regulations regarding us territories the president would appoint all seven voting members of the board and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by puerto ricos legislature governor and other public authorities.145  political status  the latest referendum on statehood independence or an associated republic was held on november 6, 2012. the people of puerto rico made history by requesting for the first time ever the conclusion of the islands current territorial status almost 78 of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve puerto ricos status and a slim but clear majority disagreed with puerto rico maintaining its present territorial status furthermore among the possible alternatives sixty-one percent of voters chose the statehood option while one third of the ballots were submitted blank.146147  on december 11, 2012, the legislative assembly of puerto rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the president and the congress of the united states to respond to the referendum of the people of puerto rico held on november 6, 2012, to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit puerto rico as a State.105 the initiative has not made puerto rico into a state  in may 2017, the natural resources defense council reported that puerto ricos water system was the worst as measured by the clean water act 70 of the population drank

most originating in the cordillera Central.158 rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions  puerto rico is composed of cretaceous to eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks overlain by younger oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks.159 most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates the oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old and are located at sierra bermeja in the southwest part of the island they may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the pacific ocean realm  puerto rico lies at the boundary between the caribbean and north american plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction these stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis these seismic events along with landslides represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern caribbean  the most recent major earthquake occurred on october 11, 1918, and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the richter scale.160 it originated off the coast of aguadilla several kilometers off the northern coast and was accompanied by a tsunami it caused extensive property damage and widespread losses damaging infrastructure especially bridges it resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and million in property damage the failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare

elevations and 70F in the mountains easterly trade winds pass across the island year round puerto rico has a rainy season which stretches from april into november the mountains of the cordillera central are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances the mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the climatic variation  the island has an average temperature of 82.4F throughout the year with an average minimum temperature of 66.9F and maximum of 85.4F daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas the temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than those on the rest of the island  between the dry and wet season there is a temperature change of around 6F this is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical atlantic ocean which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75F in february to 85F in august the highest

parts of spain such as catalonia asturias galicia and the balearic islands and numerous spanish loyalists from spains former colonies in south america settlers from outside spain also arrived in the islands including from corsica france lebanon china portugal ireland scotland germany and italy this immigration from non-hispanic countries was the result of the real cedula de gracias de 1815 decree

language spanish is and has been the only official language of the entire commonwealth judiciary system despite a 1902 english-only language law.205 all official business of the us district court for the district of puerto rico is conducted in english english is the primary language of less than 10 of the population spanish is the dominant language of business education and daily life on the island spoken by nearly 95 of the population.206  the us census bureaus 2015 update provides the following facts207 94.1 of adults speak spanish 5.8 speak only english 78.3 do not speak english well  in puerto rico public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in spanish there have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in english only objections from teaching staff are common perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.208 english is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school the languages of the deaf community are american sign language and its local variant puerto rican sign language  the spanish of puerto rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the spanish spoken elsewhere as a product of puerto rican history the island possesses a unique spanish dialect puerto rican spanish utilizes many tano words as well as english words the largest influence on the spanish spoken in puerto rico is that of the canary islands the spanish of puerto rico also includes tano words typically in the context of vegetation natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments similarly words attributed to primarily west african languages were adopted in the contexts of foods music or dances particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of sub-saharan Africans.209  religion  religious affiliation  roman catholic  protestant  other  irreligious  the roman catholic church was brought by spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in puerto rico the first dioceses in the americas including that of puerto rico were authorized by pope juliusii in 1511.212 one pope john paulii visited puerto rico in october 1984. all municipalities in puerto rico have at least one catholic church most of which are located at the town center or african slaves brought and maintained various ethnic african religious practices associated with different peoples in particular the yoruba beliefs of santera andor if and the kongo-derived palo mayombe some aspects were absorbed into syncretic christianity  protestantism which was suppressed under the spanish catholic regime has slightly reemerged under united states rule making contemporary puerto rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries although catholicism continues to be the dominant religion the first protestant church iglesia de la santsima trinidad was established in ponce by the anglican diocese of antigua in 1872.213 it was the first non-roman catholic church in the entire spanish empire in the Americas.214215  pollster pablo ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 roman catholic 28 pentecostal and 18 were members of independent churches which would give a protestant percentage of 46 if the last two populations are combined protestants collectively added up to almost two million people another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of protestants  puerto rico by virtue of its long political association with the united states is the most protestant of latin american countries with a protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent the majority of whom are pentecostal david stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 19601985 for another twenty-five years puerto rico will become 75 percent evangelical adams el charco in power politics and pentecostals in latin america edward cleary ed 1997. p.164.216  the data provided for 2014 by pew research Center,190 is summarized in the chart to the right an associated press article in march 2014 stated that than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as catholic but provided no source for this information.217  the cia world factbook reports that 85 of the population of puerto rico identifies as roman catholic while 15 identify as protestant and other neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.218 a 2013 pew research survey found that only about 45 of puerto rican adults identified themselves as catholic 29 as protestant and 20 as unaffiliated with a religion the people surveyed by pew consisted of puerto ricans living in the 50 states and dc and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth.219  by 2014, a pew research report with the sub-title widespread change in a historically catholic region indicated that only 56 of puerto ricans were catholic and that 33 were protestant this survey was completed between october 2013 and february 2014.220  an eastern orthodox community the dormition of the most holy theotokos st spyridons church is located in trujillo alto and serves the small orthodox community this affiliation accounted for under 1 of the population in 2010 according to the pew research report.221 in 1940, juanita garca peraza founded the mita congregation the first religion of puerto rican origin.222 tano religious practices have been rediscoveredreinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates similarly some aspects of african religious traditions have been kept by some adherents in 1952, a handful of american jews established the islands first synagogue this religion accounts for under 1 of the population in 2010 according to the pew research report.223224 the synagogue called shaare zedeck hired its first rabbi in 1954.225 puerto rico has the largest jewish community in the caribbean numbering 3000 people not stated,226 and is the only caribbean island in which the conservative reform and orthodox jewish movements all are represented.225227 in 2007, there were about 5,000 muslims in puerto rico representing about 0.13 of the population.228229 eight mosques are located throughout the island with most muslims living in ro piedras and caguas most of these muslims are of palestinian and jordanian descent.230231 in 2015,

Rico.233  roman catholic cathedral of san juan bautista  anglican iglesia santsima trinidad in ponce  islamic center at ponce  inside shaare zedeck in san juan  government  main articles government of puerto rico and politics of puerto rico  puerto rico has 8 senatorial districts 40 representative districts and 78 municipalities it has a republican form of government with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the united States.234235 its current powers are all delegated by the united states congress and lack full protection under the united states Constitution.236 puerto ricos head of state is the president of the united states  the government of puerto rico based on the formal republican system is composed of three branches the executive legislative and judicial branch the executive branch is headed by the governor currently ricky rossell the legislative branch consists of a bicameral legislature called the legislative assembly made up of a senate as its upper chamber and a house of representatives as its lower chamber the senate is headed by the president of the senate currently thomas rivera schatz while the house of representatives is headed by the speaker of the house currently johnny mndez the governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years with the last election held in november 2016.  the judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the supreme court of puerto rico currently maite oronoz rodrguez members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate  puerto rico is represented in the united states congress by a nonvoting delegate the resident commissioner currently jenniffer gonzlez current congressional rules have removed the commissioners power to vote in the committee of the whole but the commissioner can vote in committee.237  puerto rican elections are governed by the federal election commission and the state elections commission of puerto Rico.238not in citation given239not in citation given while residing in puerto rico puerto ricans cannot vote in us presidential elections but they can vote in primaries puerto ricans who become residents of a us state can vote in presidential elections  puerto rico hosts consulates from 41 countries mainly from the americas and europe with most located in san Juan.240 as an unincorporated territory of the united states puerto rico does not have any first-order administrative divisions as defined by the us government but has 78 municipalities at the second level mona island is not a municipality but part of the municipality of Mayagez.241  municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios and those into sectors each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term the municipality of san juan called was founded first in 1521, san germn in 1570, coamo in 1579, arecibo in 1614, aguada in 1692 and ponce in 1692. an increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th. six were founded in the 20th century the last was florida in 1971.242  political parties and elections  main article political party strength in puerto rico  the difference between the incumbent party the ppd and its opponent the pnp was a mere 0.6 in the last election this difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties with the ppd ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years the pnp on the other hand has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years the other 12 years experienced a divided government  since 1952, puerto rico has had three main political parties the popular democratic party in spanish the new progressive party in spanish and the puerto rican independence party the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the islands status with the us as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms of party strength the ppd and pnp usually hold about 47 of the vote each while the pip holds only about 5.  after 2007, other parties emerged on the island the first the puerto ricans for puerto rico party in spanish was registered that same year the party claims that it seeks to address the islands problems from a status-neutral platform but it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election four years later the 2012 election saw the emergence of the movimiento unin soberanista english sovereign union movement and the partido del pueblo trabajador english working peoples party but none obtained more than 1 of the vote  other non-registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movement  law  main articles constitution of puerto rico and law of puerto rico  the insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems  puerto rico is the only current us possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english namely spanish because the us federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in us federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courts  title 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the us government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal code  the judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does.243 such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy  political status  main articles political status of puerto rico and proposed political status for puerto rico  the nature of puerto ricos political relationship with the us is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united Nations.244 specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a us territory become a us state or become an independent country.245  within the united states  the capitol of puerto rico home of the legislative assembly in puerto rico  constitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the us Constitution.246 laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the us congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks full sovereignty of an independent nation for example the power to manage its relations with other nations which is held by the us federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the us constitution has been extended to an area congress or the courts its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say the law is.247  puerto ricans collectively made us citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth Act.248 us citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the us president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory above and not a us state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise us citizens residing in puerto Rico.236249  only fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other us supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the us armed forces and since 1917, they have been included in the us compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect  though the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of us federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico-sourced income but only under certain circumstances.250251252253254255256257 in 2009, puerto rico paid billion into the us Treasury.258 residents of puerto rico pay into social security and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement they are excluded from the supplemental security income and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a us state.259 also medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system.260  while a state may try an individual for the same crime heshe was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a us territory puerto ricos authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.243  in 1992, president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations  many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a us state there is also a us federal district court in puerto rico and puerto ricans have served as judges in that court and in other federal courts on the us mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment sonia sotomayor a new yorker of puerto rican descent serves as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states puerto ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions including serving as united states ambassadors to other nations  foreign and intergovernmental relations  main article foreign and intergovernmental relations of puerto rico  puerto rico is subject to the commerce and territorial clause of the constitution of the united states and therefore is restricted on how it can engage with other nations sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one as is the case with state governments regardless it has established several trade agreements with other nations particularly with hispanic american countries such as colombia and Panam.261262  it has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries all spanish-speaking and within the united states itself which now include spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington dc new york city and florida and has included in the past offices in chile costa rica and mexico such agreements require permission from the us department of state most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the united states and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by puerto rico and different us states  at the local level puerto rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the department of state of puerto rico an executive department headed by the secretary of state of puerto rico who also serves as the territorys lieutenant governor it is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in puerto rico the puerto rico federal affairs administration along with the office of the resident commissioner manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the united states the federal government of the united states local and state governments of the united states and public or private entities in the united states  both entities frequently assist the department of state of puerto rico in engaging with washington dc-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle puerto ricos foreign affairs such as the us department of state the agency for international development and others the current secretary of state is vctor surez melndez from the popular democratic party and member of the democratic party of the united states while the current director of the puerto rico federal affairs administration is juan eugenio hernndez mayoral also from the popular democratic and member of the democratic party  the resident commissioner of puerto rico the delegate elected by puerto ricans to represent them before the federal government including the us congress sits in the united states house of representatives serves and votes on congressional committees and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the house floor also engages in foreign affairs to the same extent as other members of congress the current resident commissioner is pedro pierluisi from the new progressive party and member of the democratic party of the united states  many puerto ricans have served as united states ambassadors to different nations and international organizations such as the organization of american states mostly but not exclusively in latin america for example maricarmen aponte a puerto rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state previously served as us ambassador to el Salvador.263  military  main article military of puerto rico  as it is a territory of the united states of america the defense of puerto rico is provided by the united states as part of the treaty of paris with the president of the united states as its commander-in-chief puerto rico has its own puerto rico national guard and its own state defense force the puerto rico state guard which by local law is under the authority of the puerto rico national guard  the commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of puerto rico who delegates his authority to the puerto rico adjutant general currently colonel marta carcana the adjutant general in turn delegates the authority over the state guard to another officer but retains the authority over the puerto rico national guard as a whole  us military installations in puerto rico the united states virgin islands throughout the 20th century  us military installations in puerto rico were part of the us atlantic command after 1993 usacom which had authority over all us military operations that took place throughout the atlantic puerto rico had been seen as crucial in supporting lantcoms mission until 1999, when us atlantic command was renamed and given a new mission as united states joint forces command puerto rico is currently under the responsibility of united states northern command  both the naval forces caribbean and the fleet air caribbean were formerly based at the roosevelt roads naval station the nfc had authority over all us naval activity in the waters of the caribbean while fair had authority over all us military flights and air operations over the caribbean with the closing of the roosevelt roads and vieques island training facilities the us navy has basically exited from puerto rico except for the ships that steam by and the only significant military presence in the island is the us army at ft buchanan the puerto rican army and air national guards and the us coast guard protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base this resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of million.264  a branch of the us army national guard is stationed in puerto rico known as the puerto rico army national guard which performs missions equivalent to those of the army national guards of the different states of the united states including ground defense disaster relief and control of civil unrest the local national guard also incorporates a branch of the us air national guard known as the puerto rico air national guard which performs missions equivalent to those of the air national guards of each one of the us states  ohio-class ballistic missile submarine uss maryland roosevelt roads naval station 1997  at different times in the 20th century the us had about 25 military or naval installations in puerto rico some very small ones,265 as well as large installations the largest of these installations were the former roosevelt roads naval station in ceiba the atlantic fleet weapons training facility on vieques the national guard training facility at camp santiago in salinas fort allen in juana diaz the armys fort buchanan in san juan the former us air force ramey air force base in aguadilla and the puerto rico air national guard at muiz air force base in san Juan.266  the former us navy facilities at roosevelt roads vieques and sabana seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government other than us coast guard and puerto rico national guard facilities there are only two remaining military installations in puerto rico the us armys small ft buchanan local veterans and reserve units and the prang rico air national guard muiz air base C-130 fleet in recent years the us congress has considered their deactivations but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in puerto rico such as retired military who rely on ft buchanan for the services available there  puerto ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the united states has been involved for example they participated in the american revolution when volunteers from puerto rico cuba and mexico fought the british in 1779 under the command of general bernardo de glvez and have continued to participate up to the present-day conflicts in iraq and Afghanistan.268  a significant number of puerto ricans participate as members and work for the us armed services largely as national guard members and civilian employees the size of the overall military-related community in puerto rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals this includes retired personnel.266 fort buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel in addition approximately 17,000 people are members of the puerto rico army and air national guards or the us reserve forces.269 puerto rican soldiers have served in every us military conflict from world war i to the current military engagement known by the united states and its allies as the war against terrorism  the 65th infantry regiment nicknamed borinqueneers from the original tano name of the island is a puerto rican regiment of the united states army the regiments motto is honor et fidelitas latin for honor and fidelity the 65th infantry regiment participated in world war i world war ii the korean war and the war on terror and in 2014 was awarded the congressional gold medal presented by president barack obama for its heroism during the korean war  administrative divisions  main article municipalities of puerto rico  there are no counties as there are in the 50 united states there are 78 municipalities municipalities are subdivided into barrios and those into sectors each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four-year terms  a map of puerto rico showing its municipalities  economy  main articles economy of puerto rico and puerto rico government-debt crisis  puerto ricos gross domestic product by economic sector  the economy of puerto rico is classified as a high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by the world economic forum but puerto rico currently has a public debt of billion to 103 of gnp and a government deficit of billion.270271 according to world bank gross national income per capita of puerto rico in 2013 is international dollars ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world.272 its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics followed by the service industry finance insurance real estate and tourismno in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice incentives conferencing exhibitions with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san Juan.274  the geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materialscitation needed and consequently its dependence on imports as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industry  puerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the us internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for us corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 of the rest of the world.275  academically most of puerto ricos economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout historyp its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains powerq as well as its highly inefficient local governmentrs which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 of its gross domestic product throughout timetu  in comparison to the different states of the united states puerto rico is poorer than mississippi poorest state of the us with 41 of its population below the poverty linev when compared to latin america puerto rico has the highest gdp per capita in the region its main trading partners are the united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto ricos dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto ricos agricultural sector represents less than 1 of GNP.282  heavy debt load  in early 2017, the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 unemployment that is more than twice the mainland us average.283 the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession.27  the commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts including bonds since 2015. with debt payments due the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.284285 action before april puerto ricos ability to execute contracts for fiscal year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened thereby putting at risk beginning july 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor us citizens living in puerto rico according to a letter sent to congress by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of health and human services they also said that must enact measures recommended by both republicans and democrats that fix puerto ricos inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.285  initially the oversight board created under promesa called for puerto ricos governor ricardo rossell to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by january 28. just before that deadline the control board gave the commonwealth government until february 28 to present a fiscal plan negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt to solve the problems a moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to may 31.27 it is essential for puerto rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA.286 an internal survey conducted by the puerto rican economists association revealed that the majority of puerto rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the board and the rossell government with more than 80 of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.287  in early august 2017, the islands financial oversight board by promesa planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month the latter had been expected to achieve million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 reduction in benefits to begin addressing the billion in unfunded pension liabilities.30288  public finances  main articles puerto rico government-debt crisis budget of the government of puerto rico and public debt of puerto rico  puerto rico has an operating budget of about U.S.9.8 billion with expenses at about billion creating a structural deficit of million 7.9 of the budget.289 the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000. throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto ricos treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973.w291  the 2012 budget of the government of puerto rico  projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of or about 70 of puerto ricos gross domestic product this sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after puerto ricos general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade status by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost 9.6or about billionof puerto ricos central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt servicex harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following yearsneeds update  for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects a budget which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the budget which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto ricos government-owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other funds  both budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget currently and respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from us federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31 of the consolidated budget  the critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7 of the consolidated budget a ratio that increased annually due to the governments inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority reporting losses of the puerto rico electric power authority the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island reporting losses of while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island reported losses of  losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 of puerto ricos entire public debt today.294 holistically from FY2000FY2010 puerto ricos debt grew at a compound annual growth rate of 9 while gdp remained stagnant.295 this has not always provided a long-term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure billion in bond debt the agency planned to seek court protection.296  in terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget in spanish formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1, the date established by law as the beginning of puerto ricos fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted the beginning of each regular session the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governors approval or approve it without the governors consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber.297  once approved the department of treasury disburses
