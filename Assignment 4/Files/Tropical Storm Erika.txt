dominica the bahamas florida  part of the 2015 atlantic hurricane season  tropical storm erika of august 2015 was the deadliest natural disaster in dominica since hurricane david in 1979. the fifth named storm of the season erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the lesser antilles hostile conditions including dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development and erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50mph contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the leeward islands and emerged over the caribbean sea on August27. erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the dominican republic the remnant system persisted for several more days ultimately moving across the gulf of mexico before dissipating over georgia on September2.  several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of erika especially dominica the storms asymmetric structure coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft led to rainfall accumulations up to 33in with grounds already saturated from antecedent rains tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods accompanying mudslides worsened the situation temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced the entire town of petite savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm all told 30people died across the island in the nations worst disaster since hurricane david the storms devastating effects in dominica prompted an influx of international assistance aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired including 5001,000 for the relocation of all of petite savannes residents  in guadeloupe heavy rainfall in the vicinity of basse-terre caused flooding and mudslides forcing roads to temporarily close approximately 250,000people in puerto rico were left without electricity the island experienced US17.37millionnb 1 in agricultural damage in the dominican republic a weather station in barahona measured 24.26in of rain including 8.8in in a single hour about 823homes suffered damage and 7,345 people were displaced five people died in haiti four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide total damage from erika is estimated to be over US500million, with US482.8million in dominica alone owing to the disastrous effects on dominica the name erika was retired in the spring of 2016, and will never again be used for an atlantic tropical cyclone it will be replaced with elsa for the 2021 atlantic hurricane season.1  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  2.1 caribbean  2.2 florida  3 impact  3.1 caribbean  3.2 united

track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on August20, 2015, the national hurricane center began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa near the atlantic shore.2 the disorganized system emerged over the atlantic ocean several hundred miles southeast of the cape verde islands the following day.34 moving quickly west the system bypassed the cape verde islands to the south on August22,5 but remained largely disorganized a sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August23, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate.3 organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis.6 the trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 1800UTC. the formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone accordingly the system was classified as tropical storm erika the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season upon its designation erika was situated roughly 1,035mi east of the lesser Antilles.3 the storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.37  at the time of erikas classification forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of erika statistical guidance and the hwrf depicted a hurricane while the ecmwf and gfs showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear the models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course accordingly the nhc noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika.7 this uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones but roughly average for weak poorly organized systems.8 throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.9 early on August27, erika managed to intensify slightly attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph and a barometric pressure of 1001mbar 29.56inHg.3 around 0900UTC, the disorganized center of erika passed over the northern tip of guadeloupe before emerging over the eastern caribbean Sea.3  official forecast positions left and various forecast models for erika versus its best track positions lines note the consistent northerly bias present in all outputs  convection remained poorly organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone as it traversed the eastern caribbean Sea.10 multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of August2728, all rotating around a broad general center one such center moved over st croix and produced gale-force gusts environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile and forecasters at the nhc continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts.11 further structural degradation ensued on August28 as erika approached the dominican republic based on data from hurricane hunters erika degenerated into a broad area of low pressureno longer meeting the definition of a tropical cycloneshortly after 1200UTC near the southeastern coast of the dominican Republic.3 operationally the nhc maintained advisories on erika until 1330UTC on August29.12 it was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the system.13  around 2100UTC on August28, the remnants of erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the dominican Republic.14 the disheveled system emerged over the windward passage early on August29.13 thereafter the system skirted the northern coast of cuba and entered the gulf of mexico on August31. turning northward the disturbance eventually crossed northern florida on September2 before dissipating over georgia the following day.3  preparationsedit  the nhcs forecast track for tropical storm erika at 500a.m. edt on August28, just before its dissipation as a tropical cyclone depicting the storm traversing the dominican republic brushing the bahamas and moving across the entirety of the florida peninsula  caribbeanedit  various local governments issued tropical storm watches and warnings for their respective nations throughout the duration of erika watches and warnings covered the lesser antilles from guadeloupe northward almost the entirety of the greater antilles and the Bahamas.3 the red cross opened four shelters to the public across the united states virgin Islands.15 the local health department also opened special needs shelters on st croix and st thomas all non-essential government personnel were given administrative leave on August27. owing to rough seas local ports temporarily closed although airports remained open several airlines cancelled flights.16 a territory-wide curfew was imposed until the afternoon of August28.17  schools ports and beaches were closed across the dominican Republic.18 the army of the dominican republic deployed 275soldiers and alongside the nations air force assisted with the evacuation of residents the navy was placed on standby for potential search and rescue operations.19 officials in haiti suspended air service banned highway travel between departments and ordered small watercraft to remain at port.20 evacuation shelters were opened across all departments and 254prisoners were relocated from gonaves to three other facilities.21  floridaedit  on August28, florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency.22 despite the storm dissipating shortly thereafter scott kept the emergency declaration in place and stated storm has been completely unpredictable the whole timewe will still get a lot of rain and a lot of flooding.23 thirty members of the florida national guard were positioned while another 8,000 were placed on standby.23 a collective 17flights were cancelled at miami international airport and fort lauderdalehollywood international airport on August28.24 schools in hendry county preemptively closed for August31,23 with officials citing flooding concerns.25 sandbags were distributed to residents in doral hallandale beach hollywood and Sweetwater.26 the last hurricane to impact the state was hurricane wilma in 2005. since that time the states population grew by 2million with many presumed to have never experienced a hurricane before.23 some newer residents remained apathetic over the storm dismissing it as excuse to skip work or school or to party.27  impactedit  impact by country or region  countyregion  deaths  damage  ref  direct  indirect  dominica  30  0    dominican

rough seas in martinique grounded boats.35 landslides and felled trees blocked several roadways across the island.36 elsewhere in the lesser antilles effects from erika were negligible.37  the outer bands of erika brought much needed rain drought-stricken puerto Rico17 a station in adjuntas recorded 4.45in of rain.3 tropical storm-force wind gusts peaking at 59mph in Maricao,3 caused substantial disruption to the power grid leaving approximately 250,000people without electricity.38 thirty-six homes sustained roof damage across interior locations of the territory and agriculture sustained US17.37million in damage.32  rainfall from the remnants of erika across the southeastern united states  a weather station in barahona dominican republic measured 24.26in of rain during erikas passage including 8.8in in a single hour surrounding areas reported significantly less rain however.39 throughout the country 823homes suffered damage and 7,345people were displaced erika blocked over 400 roads and left many power outages.40 winds gusts of 50mph in azua caused at least 400million dop in damage to the banana crop.30 heavy rains also impacted haiti which was still recovering from a catastrophic earthquake in 2010 an estimated 60,000people remained in emergency housing.18 four persons died and eleven others were hospitalized in logne when a truck crashed into a bus on rain-slicked roads and exploded.31 a fifth death occurred during a landslide in port-au-prince two people in the area were injured after a house collapsed.18  the remnants of erika later brought much needed rains to cuba which was suffering from its worst drought since 1901.18  united statesedit  later erikas remnants dropped locally heavy rainfall across florida particularly in the miami metropolitan area a station northwest of sweetwater observed 9in of rain.41 minor flash flooding left streets in wynwood impassable.42 farther north in flagler county scattered thunderstorms produced isolated instances of heavy rain 2.2in fell within one hour in palm Coast.43 in the greater jacksonville area lightning struck the sally b mathis elementary school resulting in damage to the air conditioning unit and evacuation of students.44 in neighboring georgia moisture from erikas remnants fueled scattered severe thunderstorms large hail caused US2.3million in damage near Woodstock.33 strong winds gusting up to 60mph accompanied these storms downing trees and power lines in cherokee polk and troup counties.454647 additional rainfall extended north through the Carolinas.41  effects in dominicaedit  the rugged terrain of dominica makes it prone to landslides in heavy rain events the town of petite savanne situated on steep cliffs was rendered uninhabitable after numerous landslides devastated the area  although erika passed to the north of dominica as a weak tropical storm torrential rains associated with the storm impacted the country.3 unusually high precipitable water values of 2.6in were present over the island as erika moved through orographic influence exacerbated rainfall rates and this was further compounded with the formation of a temporary mesoscale low over the island as the primary circulation of erika continued west more than 8in of rain fell across the entire island in less than 48hours, with an island-wide average of 24in 2 during the period of heaviest rain average rainfall across the entire island exceeded 3.5in per hour rates along the macoucherie river reached 11in per hour the heaviest rain was concentrated around the nations tallest mountain morne diablotins where an estimated 31 to 33in to 850mm fell rainfall across morne diablotin national park generally exceeded 24in a secondary peak accumulation of 26 to 28in to 700mm occurred in the southeastern part of the island around morne trois Pitons.48 observed accumulations include 17in at gleau Gommier,49 12.62in at canefield airport and 8.74in at douglascharles Airport.3 with grounds already saturated from nearly two weeks of rain prior to erika much of the precipitation did not penetrate the surface in multiple watersheds runoff exceeded 60percent of accumulations.48  catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides ensued across the island,3 resulting in dominicas worst natural disaster since hurricane david in 1979.5051 across the islands rugged terrain the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water these earthen dams subsequently collapsed leading to amplified flooding downstream flow rates in these localized events vastly exceeded values expected by international commission on large dams modeling a post-storm study of 16rivers on the island revealed peak discharge values in excess of 1,000m3s along 5 rivers with a maximum of 2,876m3s along the malabuka River.48  nearly 17,000 of the nations 71,293people were severely impacted by the storm.52 a total of 30people were killed,3 20others were injured and 574people were left homeless.2829 more than 890homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.53 infrastructure suffered tremendous damage 6percent of bridges and 17percent of roads were wiped out furthermore half of the nations bridges and a quarter of its roads were damaged.54 total losses amounted to EC1.3billion roughly 90percent of dominicas gross domestic product.29 dominica prime minister roosevelt skerrit stated in a national announcement on August28 that visual damage i saw today i fear may have set our development process back by 20 years.20  flooding crippled transportation and communication with eight bridges severely damaged or destroyed leaving many areas of the island isolated.2955 boetica and delices remained cut-off by ground for more than three weeks.56 more than 12major rivers topped their banks.57 approximately 45percent of residents lost electricity,55 and almost the entirety of the water supply network was damaged.29 additionally 50percent of telephone service was lost.55 both canefield and douglascharles airports were flooded with water rising above a small airplane at the latter.58 douglascharles airport sustained more than EC39.5million in damage and was closed until September18.5960 the main river running through roseau the nations capital burst its banks during the overnight of August2627, flooding surrounding areas.61 one person was killed during a mudslide and one building collapsed in the city.5862  the small community of petite savanne was virtually destroyed with 217homes leveled and all residents forced to evacuate.6364 twenty people died or were presumed dead in the village accounting for two-thirds of the deaths attributed to erika in Dominica.365 residents dug through mud and debris often with their bare hands to rescue those trapped and in many cases did so with nearby homes on the verge of collapse.57 the village was isolated for several days and residents buried victims before help arrived.66  local responseedit  immediately following erikas devastating impact in dominica on August27, the organisation of eastern caribbean states convened to determine an assessment plan.67 the government of dominica declared nine areas special disaster areas petite savanne pichelin good hope bath estate dubique campbell coulibistrie san sauveur and petite Soufriere.68 the national emergency operations centre was activated and worked in conjunction with various local agencies to conduct relief missions approximately 100personnel were deployed for various relief measures including search and rescue.69 the dominica spa health and wellness association worked in conjunction with the trinidad-based centre for human development to provide psychological support to victims70 eight trauma specialists were sent to Dominica.71  the psychiatric unit of princess margaret hospital conducted field assessments and provided emotional support to residents in a report on September18, they noted that residents in coulibistrie remained in a state of shock for weeks after erika with many struggling to begin the recovery process.72 the ministry of health highlighted concerns over post-storm diseases particularly from mosquitoes due to a major increase in the usage of water storage containers.73 an outbreak of gastroenteritis ensued in the weeks following erika with 153cases confirmed by September22. cases were primarily in portsmouth saint joseph and Roseau.74  a unique means of supplying food and water the communities of boetica and delices only accessible by air due to a gorge 260ft wide and 200ft deep was established in the form of a zip-line in late-september this served as the primary means of aid until a 98ft bailey bridge was constructed.75 by April2016, the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation projects reached EC7million supplementing reconstruction efforts by china and the united kingdom the nations government allocated a further EC30million to enhancing road safety.77 the food and agriculture organization allocated EC300,000 for farmers in October.78 through June2016, the government provided victims with EC56million primarily to cover shelters and food.79  international assistanceedit  rfalyme bay provided vital assistance to many isolated communities in early september  within 48hours of the storm governments of canada france the united kingdom the united states the european union and various intergovernmental organizations under the united nationssuch as the pan american health organization unicef and united nations development programmepledged aid antigua and barbuda barbados montserrat saint lucia and trinidad and tobago provided support teamsfirefighters police search and rescue and military personneland established supply routes with Dominica.37 the caribbean disaster emergency management agency pledged assistance to dominica offering two helicopters with supplies and medics from Trinidad.17 support teams from the cdema arrived in dominica on August28.37 the regional security system deployed 83personnel whom conducted search and rescue operations and assisted in the evacuation of hundreds of residents.80 china and the caribbean development bank offered US300,000 and US200,000 in aid respectively to the nation.8182 china later provided an additional US200,000 in October.83 the government of venezuela airlifted 2,000tons of food and supplies to dominica and pledged to provide a helicopter carrier ship on August29.84 supplies from venezuela were bolstered to 10tons by September1, and the ship pdv marina was deployed that day with an additional 13tons worth fuel machinery and other supplies.85  further assistance was provided by the governments of cuba grenada and st kitts and nevis by August31,8687 the latter of which donated EC1million the british-flagged rfalyme bay arrived in dominica on September2, carrying medical supplies marines,63 and a lynx Mk.8 helicopter.89 the helicopter flew 25flights over a period of five days to isolated communities providing them with 2tonnes of supplies daily more than 20tonnes of water and 5.3tonnes of food were provided by rfa lyme Bay.90 the governments of the british virgin islands and taiwan each pledged US100,000 in funds.9192 digicel and lime coordinated restoration efforts to the nations fiber-optic networks.93 the former requested donations from 32countries while the latter assisted in establishing supply routes to isolated communities.94 digical also partnered with the dominican red cross paying for transportation so relief teams could access isolated towns.95  brazil provided medical supplies in October2015 to the disaster-struck nation  the government of the cayman islands donated US500,000 and requested residents of the territory to donate supplies.96 japans government provided US100,000-worth of generators water purifiers and water tanks through the japan international cooperation Agency.97 a further TT5million was provided by trinidad and Tobago.98 the government of guyana provided a shipment of 68tonnes of rice collected through public and private donations three times more than targeted.99 through its excess rainfall programme the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility provided 6.5million to the government of dominicathe maximum payout allowable.100 thousands of school supplies including books and writing utensils were collected by the caribbean Community.101 the adventist development and relief agency all hands volunteers convoy of hope childfund and the organization of american states also provided assistance.102  the initial response from unicef included the distribution of over 600hygiene kits and 4,000water purification tablets.52 logistical support namely satellite phones solar chargers and laptops were provided by the international telecommunication Union.103 four tonnes of medical supplies provided by the paho arrived on September9,104 and the government of brazil supplied additional medical items in October.105 after an initial release of funds on September3, the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies launched an emergency appeal on September10 for approximately US1million to assist 12,000people.106 the societys relief operation lasted until April10, 2016, and provided 12,382people with life-saving assistance the ifrcs primary goal was to restore access to clean water more than half a million litres of water was provided during the seven-month operation in regards to health psychosocial support was made available to 873people, roughly half of the original goal hygiene awareness and distribution of kits proved successful with all 1,000kits supplied to those in need the dominican red cross mass-promoted the red cross first aid mobile app to 8,000phones, though only 399 people downloaded it cash grants of US334by way of visa debit cardswere provided to 279families to cover lost property a total of 1,000mattresses were provided to survivors and a request for additional beds was made however limited funds prevented fulfillment.107  in March2017, the cdema approved a 9.6million plan to address gaps in dominicas disaster response legislation uncovered during the response to Erika.108  reconstructionedit  the destruction of petite savanne forced the evacuation of 823people the village was later deemed uninhabitable and a new town needed to be built elsewhere.109 many were temporarily relocated to the dominica grammar school in roseau however members of the public looked upon the evacuees with scorn and insulted them for disrupting their daily lives parliamentary representative kenneth darroux pleaded with residents to be understanding and patient with those whom were displaced.110 plans for a new settlement were established in February2016, with plans to build 5001,000homes. similarly all residents of dubique were forced to evacuate they were relocated to temporary homes in grand bay provided by Venezuela.109 ten two- and three-bedroom homes were provided by the adra costs for resettlement and reconstruction exceeded EC91million power was restored to all areas of the nation except for petite savanne and dubique by September28.112 restoration to the nations water system was completed in January2016 however permanent systems were still to be constructed.113  french organizations provided 70,000 for the reconstruction of two schools.114 repair of douglascharles airport was deemed a priority though the first phase of rehabilitation for runways and aprons took more than a year to complete in addition to repairs greater flood defense systems were implemented including dredging flood walls and river training.115 construction of 25planned homes by the adra began in February2016, with projected completion in 2017 50volunteers were involved in the project.116 in November2016, dominica signed an agreement with the european union for an 8.9million rehabilitation project.117 in a join dominicaunited kingdom project a new road from loubiere to bagatelle in southeastern dominica was announced in March2017. the EC100million plan would ensure the road could handle heavy rain events with 1214culverts and 3bridges. furthermore road edge failure issues were to be addressed.118  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  list of wettest tropical cyclones by country  tropical storm
