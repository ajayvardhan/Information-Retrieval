sandy  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  hurricane sandy began as a low pressure system which developed sufficient organized convection to be classified as tropical depression eighteen on October22 south of kingston Jamaica.16 it moved slowly at first due to a ridge to the north low wind shear and warm waters allowed for strengthening,16 and the system was named tropical storm sandy late on October22.17 early on October24, an eye began developing and it was moving steadily northward due to an approaching trough.18 later that day the national hurricane center upgraded sandy to hurricane status about 65mi south of kingston Jamaica.19 at about 1900UTC that day sandy made landfall near kingston with winds of about 85mph just offshore cuba sandy rapidly intensified to winds of 115mph and at that intensity it made landfall just west of santiago de cuba at 0525UTC on October25.21  play media  a time-lapse video made from nasa satellite images of hurricane sandy  after sandy exited cuba the structure became disorganized,22 and it turned to the north-northwest over the Bahamas.23 by October27, sandy was no longer fully tropical and despite strong shear it maintained convection due to influence from an approaching trough the same trough turned the hurricane to the northeast.24 after briefly weakening to a tropical storm,25 sandy re-intensified into a hurricane,26 and on October28 an eye began redeveloping.27 the storm moved around an upper-level low over the eastern united states and also to the southwest of a ridge over atlantic canada turning it to the northwest.28 sandy briefly re-intensified to category 2 intensity on the morning of October29, around which time it had a wind diameter of over 1,150miles and a central pressure of 943 mb which set records for many cities across the northeastern united states for the lowest pressures ever observed.29 the convection diminished while the hurricane accelerated toward the new jersey coast,30 and the hurricane was no longer tropical by 2100UTC on October29.31 about 2 12 hours later sandy made landfall near brigantine new Jersey,32 with winds of 80mph during the next four days sandys remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over ontario before merging with another low pressure area over eastern canada on november 2.333  forecasts  on october 23, 2012, the path of hurricane sandy was correctly predicted by the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts headquartered in reading england nearly eight days in advance of its striking the american east coast the computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the new yorknew jersey region on october 29, rather than turn east and head out to the open atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do by october 27, four days after the ecmwf made its prediction the national weather service and national hurricane center confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the european model the national weather service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its european counterpart did a hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make more accurate predictions and do so far more in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed.34  relation to global warming  see also tropical cyclones and climate change  according to ncar senior climatologist kevin e trenberth answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change is that it is the wrong question all weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be.35 although noaa meteorologist martin hoerling attributes sandy to more than the coincidental alignment of a tropical storm with an extratropical storm,36 trenberth does agree that the storm was caused by variability but adds that it was by global warming.37 one factor contributing to the storms strength was abnormally warm sea surface temperatures offshore the east coast of the united statesmore than 3C above normal to which global warming had contributed 0.6C as the temperature of the atmosphere increases the capacity to hold water increases leading to stronger storms and higher rainfall amounts.37  as they move north atlantic hurricanes typically are forced east and out to sea by the prevailing Westerlies.38 in sandys case this typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over greenland resulting in a negative north atlantic oscillation forming a kink in the jet stream causing it to double back on itself off the east coast sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow.38 the blocking pattern over greenland also stalled an arctic front which combined with the cyclone.38 mark fischetti of scientific american said that the jet streams unusual shape was caused by the melting of arctic ice.39 trenberth said that while a negative north atlantic oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.36 sea level at new york and along the new jersey coast has increased by nearly a foot mm over the last hundred years,40 which contributed to the storm surge.41 harvard geologist daniel p schrag calls hurricane sandys 13-foot m storm surge an example of what will by mid-century be the norm on the eastern seaboard.42  preparations  caribbean and bermuda  after the storm became a tropical cyclone on october 22, the government of jamaica issued a tropical storm watch for the entire island.43 early on October23, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued.44 at

was upgraded to a tropical storm warning.50  at 1515UTC on October26, the bermuda weather service issued a tropical storm watch for bermuda reflecting the enormous size of the storm and the anticipated wide-reaching impacts.51  united states  white house conference with fema and department of homeland security in preparation for arrival of the hurricane  wikinews has related news us

Halloween.535455 as coverage continued several media outlets began eschewing this term in favor of utilities and governments along the east coast attempted to head off long-term power failures sandy might cause power companies from the southeast to new england alerted independent contractors to be ready to help repair storm damaged equipment quickly and asked employees to cancel vacations and
