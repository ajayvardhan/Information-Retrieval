the first european settlement in the tropics ideally located for the atlantic slave trade the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries attracting merchants privateers and pirates

were uninhabited.12 the islands of the cape verde archipelago were discovered by genoese and portuguese navigators around 1456. according to portuguese official records,13 the first discoveries were made by genoa-born antnio de noli who was afterwards appointed governor of cape verde by portuguese king afonso v other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries in the cape verde archipelago are diogo gomes was with antnio de noli and claimed to have been the first to land on and name santiago island diogo dias diogo afonso and the italian alvise cadamosto  in 1462, portuguese settlers arrived at santiago and founded a settlement they called ribeira grande called cidade velha to avoid being confused with the town of ribeira grande on the santo anto island ribeira grande was the first permanent european settlement in the tropics.14  a view of monte cara from mindelo  in the 16th century the archipelago prospered from the atlantic slave trade.14 pirates occasionally attacked the portuguese settlements sir francis drake an english corsair privateering under a letter of marque granted by the english crown twice sacked the capital ribeira grande in 1585 when it was a part of the iberian Union.14 after a french attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby praia which became the capital in 1770.14  decline in the slave trade in the 19th

geographyedit  main article geography of cape verde  a topographic map of cape verde  a satellite photo of the cape verde islands 2010.  the cape verde archipelago is in the atlantic ocean approximately 570 kilometres off the western coast of the african continent near senegal the gambia and mauritania and is part of the macaronesia ecoregion it lies between latitudes 14 and 18N, and longitudes 22 and 26W.  the country is a horseshoe-shaped cluster of ten islands inhabited and eight islets,27 that constitute an area of 4033km2.27  the islands are spatially divided into two groups  the barlavento islands islands santo anto so vicente santa luzia so nicolau sal boa Vista27 and  the sotavento islands maio santiago fogo Brava.27  the largest island both in size and population is santiago which hosts the nations capital praia the principal urban agglomeration in the archipelago.27  three boa vista and maio are fairly flat sandy and dry the others are generally rockier with more vegetation  physical geography and geologyedit  geologically the islands covering a combined area of slightly over 4,033 square kilometres square miles are principally composed of igneous rocks with volcanic structures and pyroclastic debris comprising the majority of the archipelagos total volume the volcanic and plutonic rocks are distinctly basic the archipelago is a soda-alkaline petrographic province with a petrologic succession similar to that found in other macaronesian islands  magnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back 125150 million years the islands themselves date from 8 million the west to 20 million years the east.28 the oldest exposed rocks occurred on maio and northern peninsula of santiago and are 128131 million year old pillow lavas the first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early miocene and reached its peak at the end of this period when the islands reached their maximum sizes historical volcanism human settlement has been restricted to the island of fogo  the origin of the islands volcanism has been attributed to a hotspot associated with bathymetric swell that formed the cape verde Rise.29 the rise is one of the largest protuberances in the worlds oceans rising 2.2 kilometres miles in a semi-circular region of 1200km2, associated with a rise of the geoid and elevated surface heat flow.28  most recently erupting in 2014, pico do fogo is the largest active volcano in the region it has a 8 kilometres miles diameter caldera whose rim is 1,600 metres feet altitude and an interior cone that rises to 2,829 metres feet above sea level the caldera resulted from subsidence following the partial evacuation of the magma chamber along a cylindrical column from within magma chamber a depth of 8 kilometres miles  extensive salt flats are found on sal and Maio.27 on santiago santo anto and so nicolau arid slopes give way in places to sugarcane fields or banana plantations spread along the base of towering mountains.27 ocean cliffs have been formed by catastrophic debris landslides.30  according to the president of nauru cape verde has been ranked the eighth most endangered nation due to flooding from climate change.31  geography of cape verde  the beach of calhau with monte verde in the background on the island of so vicente  the

cape verde climate  cape verdes climate is milder than that of the african mainland because the surrounding sea moderates temperatures on the islands and cold atlantic currents produce an arid atmosphere around the archipelago conversely the islands do not receive the upwellings streams that affect the west african coast so the air temperature is cooler than in senegal but the sea is warmer because the orographic relief of some islands such as santiago with steep mountains cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants rocks soil logs moss etc on the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands exclusively in mountainous areas like santo anto island the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forest and laurel forest as this vegetation27 average daily high temperatures range from 26C in february to 31C in September.32 cape verde is part of the sahelian arid belt with nothing like the rainfall levels of nearby west Africa.27 it rains irregularly between august and october with frequent brief heavy downpours.27 a desert is usually defined as terrain that receives less than 250mm of annual rainfall sals total of
