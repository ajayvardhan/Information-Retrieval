kilometres in size and has an estimated 10.8 million people,3 making it the most populous country in the caribbean community and the second-most populous country in the caribbean as a whole  the region was originally inhabited by the indigenous tano people spain discovered the island on 5 december 1492 during the first voyage of christopher columbus across the atlantic when columbus initially landed in haiti he had thought he had found india or Asia.13 on christmas day 1492, columbus flagship the santa maria ran aground north of what is now Limonade.14151617 as a consequence columbus ordered his men to salvage what they could from the ship and he created the first european settlement in the americas naming it la navidad after the day the ship was destroyed  the island was named la espaola and claimed by spain which ruled until the early 17th century competing claims and settlements by the french led to the western portion of the island being ceded to france which named it

lieutenant jean-jacques dessalines who declared haitis sovereignty and later became the first emperor of haiti jacques I.20212223 the haitian revolution lasted just over a dozen years and apart from

to mean of high mountains.34 the h is silent in french and the in hati is a diacritical mark used to show that the second vowel is pronounced separately as in the word nave.35 in english this rule for the pronunciation is often disregarded thus the spelling haiti is used there are different anglicizations for its pronunciation such as high-ti high-ee-ti and haa-ee-ti which are still in use but hay-ti is the most widespread and established.36  the name was restored by haitian revolutionary jean-jacques dessalines as the official name of independent saint-domingue as a tribute to the amerindian predecessors.37  in french haitis nickname is the pearl of the antilles perle des antilles because of both its natural beauty,38 and the amount of wealth it accumulated for the kingdom of france as it was considered the richest colony owned by any of the european powers at the time.39  historyedit  main article history of haiti  pre-columbian historyedit  main article chiefdoms of hispaniola  the five caciquedoms of hispaniola at the time of the arrival of christopher columbus  at the time of european encounter the island of hispaniola of which haiti occupies the western three-eighths,1112 was one of many caribbean islands inhabited by the tano indians speakers of an arawakan language called taino which has been preserved in the haitian creole language the tano name for the entire island was haiti the people had migrated over centuries into the caribbean islands from south america genetic studies show they were related to the yanomami of the amazon basin they also originated in central and south america after migrating to caribbean islands in the 15th century the tano were pushed into the northeast caribbean islands by the Caribs.40  in the tano societies of the caribbean islands the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique or chief as the europeans understood them the island of haiti was divided among five caciquats the magua in the north east the marien in the north west the xaragua in the south west the maguana in the center region of cibao and the higuey in the south east.4142 the caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms with payment consisting of harvests  tano cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country these have become national symbols of haiti and tourist attractions modern-day logane started as a french colonial town in the southwest is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of Xaragua.40  spanish rule  christopher columbus landing on hispaniola  1510 tano pictograph telling a story of missionaries arriving in hispaniola  navigator christopher columbus landed in haiti on 5 december 1492, in an area that he named mle Saint-Nicolas,43 and claimed the island for the crown of castile nineteen days later his ship the santa mara ran aground near the present site of cap-hatien columbus left 39 men on the island who founded the settlement of la navidad  the sailors carried endemic eurasian infectious diseases the natives lacked immunity to these new diseases and died in great numbers in epidemics.4445 the first recorded smallpox epidemic in the americas erupted on hispaniola in 1507.46 the encomienda system forced natives to work in gold mines and plantations.47  the spanish passed the laws of burgos 151213, which forbade the maltreatment of natives endorsed their conversion to Catholicism,48 and gave legal framework to encomiendas the natives were brought to these sites to work in specific plantations or industries.49  as a gateway to the caribbean hispaniola became a haven for pirates during the early colonial period the western part of the island was settled by french buccaneers among them was bertrand dogeron who succeeded in growing tobacco he recruited many french colonial families from martinique and guadeloupe european nations were competing for control in the new world in the caribbean as well as in north america france and spain settled their hostilities on the island by way of the treaty of ryswick of 1697, and divided hispaniola between them  french rule  further information saint-domingue  france received the western third and subsequently named it saint-domingue the french equivalent of santo domingo the spanish colony of hispaniola and the name of its patron saint saint Dominic.50  to develop it into sugarcane plantations the french imported thousands of slaves from africa sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century by 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in saint-domingue in contrast by 1763 the white population of french canada a vast territory had numbered 65,000.51 the whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of african slaves they had imported to work on their plantations which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane in the north of the island slaves were able to retain many ties to african cultures religion and language these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported africans blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one  the french-enacted code noir code prepared by jean-baptiste colbert and ratified by louis xiv had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms saint-domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies one-third of newly imported africans died within a few years.52 many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever.53 they had low birth rates and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slaverycitation needed  as in its louisiana colony the french colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color the mixed-race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves later mixed-race women over time many were released from slavery they established a separate social class white french creole fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to france for their education some men of color were admitted into the military more of the free people of color lived in the south of the island near port-au-prince and many intermarried within their community they frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen and began to own some property some became slave holders the free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights  slaves that made it to haiti from the trans-atlantic journey and slaves born in haiti were first documented in haitis archives and transferred to frances ministry of defense and the ministry of foreign affairs as of 2015update, these records are in the national archives of france according to the 1788 census haitis population consisted of nearly 25,000 whites 22,000 free coloureds and 700,000 slavescitation needed  haitian revolution  main article haitian revolution  burning of the town of cap-franais c.1815  general toussaint louverture  inspired by the french revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of man free people of color and slaves in saint-domingue and the french west indies pressed for freedom and more civil rights most important was the revolution of the slaves in saint-domingue starting in the northern plains in 1791, where africans greatly outnumbered the whites  in 1792, the french government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control to build an alliance with the gens de couleur and slaves the french commissioners sonthonax and polverel abolished slavery in the colony six months later the national convention led by robespierre and the jacobins endorsed abolition and extended it to all the french colonies.54  political leaders in the united states which was a new republic itself reacted with ambivalence at times providing aid to enable planters to put down the revolt later in the revolution the us provided support to black haitian military forces with the goal of reducing french influence in north america and the Caribbean.55  toussaint louverture a former slave and leader in the slave revolt drove out the spanish santo domingo and the british invaders who threatened the colony in the uncertain years of revolution the united states played both sides off against each other with its traders supplying both the french and the rebels.56 the struggle within haiti between the free people of color led by andr rigaud and the black haitians led by louverture devolved into the war of the knives in 1799 and 1800.5758 many surviving free people of color left the island as refugees  battle between polish troops in french service and the haitian rebels  after louverture created a separatist constitution napolon bonaparte in 1802 sent an expedition of 20,000 soldiers and as many sailors59 under the command of his brother-in-law general charles leclerc to retake the island the french achieved some victories but within a few months most of the french had died from yellow fever.60 more than 50,000 french troops died in an attempt to retake the colony including 18 generals.61 the french captured louverture transporting him to france for trial he was imprisoned at fort de joux where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly tuberculosis.52  the slaves along with free gens de couleur and allies continued their fight for independence jean-jacques dessalines defeated french troops at the battle of vertires on 18 november 1803, leading the first ever successful slave army revolution in late 1803, france withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a north american empire with the war going badly he sold louisiana france to the united states in the louisiana purchase  first empire  main articles first empire of haiti and 1804

exact number of deaths due to the haitian revolution is unknown  dessalines was proclaimed for life by his troops.63 dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others.64 once in power he ordered the massacre of most whites without regard to age or gender those who did not swear allegiance to him were slain.65 in the continuing competition for power he was assassinated by rivals on 17 october 1806.66  only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared the polish soldiers the majority of whom deserted from the french army and fought alongside the haitian rebels the little group of german colonists invited to the north-west region and a group of medical doctors and professionals.67 reportedly people with connections to officers in the haitian army were also spared as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men.68  fearful of the influence of the slaves revolution us president thomas jefferson refused to recognize the new republic as did most european nations the us did not officially recognize haiti for decades until after the start of the american civil War.69  the revolution led to a wave of emigration.70 in 1809, nearly 10,000 refugees from saint-domingue settled en masse in new Orleans.71 they doubled the citys population in addition the newly arrived slaves added to the citys african population.72

haiti  beginning in 1821, president jean-pierre boyer also an homme de couleur and successor to ption reunified the two parts of haiti and extended control over the entire western portion of the island.75 in addition after santo domingo declared its independence from spain on 30 november 1821, boyer sent forces in to take control boyer ruled the entire island with iron rule ending slavery in santo Domingo.76 after santo domingo achieved independence from haiti it established a separate national identity  struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce commodity crops boyer passed the code rural which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land enter the towns or start farms or shops of their own following the revolution many peasants wanted to have their own farms rather than work on plantations.7778  the american colonization society encouraged free blacks in the united states to emigrate to haiti starting in september 1824, more than 6,000 african americans migrated to haiti with transportation paid by the ACS.79 many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the united states  in july 1825, king charles x of france during a period of restoration of the monarchy sent a fleet to reconquer the island under pressure president boyer agreed to a treaty by which france formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs by an order of 17 april 1825, the king of france renounced his rights of sovereignty over santo domingo and recognized the independence of Haiti.808182  though the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838, haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947. the haitian president would have had little choice as the country unknowingly to him would have been blockaded by french ships if the exchange did not go the french way  after losing the support of haitis elite boyer was ousted in 1843. a long succession of coups followed his departure to exilecitation needed83  the enforced payment to france reduced haitis economy for years western nations did not give haiti formal diplomatic recognition both of these problems kept the haitian economy

humiliate the haitian government during the luders affair  in the first decades of the 20th century haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to france germany and the united states fearing possible foreign intervention president woodrow wilson sent us marines into haiti in december 1914, just after the outbreak of world war i they removed from the haitian national bank for in new york thus giving the united states control of the bank.85  in an expression of the theodore roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine the united states occupied the island in july 1915 after the assassination of haitis president vilbrun guillaume sam the pro-american president had been dragged from the french legation and killed in the street by local insurgents after he had ordered 167 political prisoners killed usswashington under rear admiral caperton arrived in port-au-prince to try to restore order and protect american interests this began a nearly 20-year occupation by us forces within days the marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house which controlled all the finances of the island nation the marines declared martial law and severely censored the press within weeks a new pro-american president philippe sudr dartiguenave had been installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the united states the new constitution included a clause that allowed for the first time foreign ownership of land in haiti which was bitterly opposed by the haitian legislature and citizenry  the next 5 years witnessed numerous cases of intimidation arson torture and murder of the haitian population by us marines and their local enforcers the gendarmerie dhaiti the us marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism allowing them to behave this way mary renda writes that was an assertion of authority superiority and control expressed in the metaphor of a fathers relationship with his children.86 this mindset allowed the marines to act highly authoritatively in haiti and carry out atrocious acts it has been estimated that up to 15,000 haitians lost their lives at the hands of the occupying forces either through armed opposition or through the system of forced labor this system allowed the occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms at gunpoint if necessary to build roads bridges etc many resisted and were killed on the spot while others died working or due to disease and malnutrition while living in squalid work camps.87  this chapter in the two nations histories reflects the oppressive foreign policy of the united states toward its neighbors in central america and the caribbean that is often characterized as diplomacy or one of many wars that plagued the region in the early 20th century us marines were stationed in the country until 1934, a period of nineteen years and were finally ordered from the island by franklin d roosevelt as a demonstration of his neighbor policy however the united states controlled the economy of the island and heavily influenced elections in haiti up through the 1980s.citation needed  sisal was introduced

together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934.89 the debts were still outstanding and the american financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941.90  recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the haitian people had an influence on united states writers including eugene oneill james weldon johnson langston hughes zora neale hurston and orson Welles.91  after us forces left in 1934, dominican dictator rafael trujillo used anti-haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool in an event that became known as the parsley massacre he ordered his army to kill haitians living on the dominican side of the border.9293 between 10,000 and 20,000 haitians were killed.92 though he was one-quarter haitian himself trujillo continued policies against the neighboring population for some time  on 27 september 1945,94 haiti became a founding member of the united nations to the league of nations in which haiti was also a founding member.9596 in the 1950s, american and european tourists started to visit Haiti.97  the waterfront area of port-au-prince was redeveloped to allow cruise ship passengers to walk from the docks to cultural attractions among these attractions were the moorish-styled iron market where fine haitian art and mahogany were sold in the evenings entrepreneurs provided dancing casino gambling and voodoo shows truman capote and nol

november to january  port-au-prince receives an average annual rainfall of 1,370mm there are two rainy seasons apriljune and octobernovember haiti is subject to periodic droughts and floods made more severe by deforestation hurricanes are also a menace in summary haiti is generally a hot and humid tropical climate  geologyedit  haitis topography  there are blind thrust faults associated with the enriquillo-plantain garden fault system over which haiti lies.127 after the earthquake of 2010, there was no evidence of surface rupture and based on seismological geological and ground deformation data.128  the northern boundary of the fault is where the caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about 20mm inches per year in relation to the north american plate the strike-slip fault system in the region has two branches in haiti the septentrional-oriente fault in the north and the enriquillo-plantain garden fault in the south  a 2007 earthquake hazard study noted that the enriquillo-plantain garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2Mw earthquake similar in size to the 1692 jamaica earthquake.129 a study team presented a hazard assessment of the enriquillo-plantain garden fault system to the 18th caribbean geologic conference in march 2008, noting the large strain the team recommended priority historical geologic rupture studies as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40years.130 an article published in haitis le matin newspaper in september 2008 cited comments by geologist patrick charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in Port-au-Prince.131  haiti also has rare elements such as gold which can be found at the mont organis gold mine.132  environmentedit  main articles environment of haiti and deforestation in haiti  haitis border with the dominican republic in 2002 shows the amount of deforestation on the haitian side  the soil erosion released from the upper catchments and deforestation have caused periodic and severe flooding in haiti as experienced for example on 17 september 2004. earlier in may that year floods had killed over 3,000 people on haitis southern border with the dominican Republic.133  haitis forests covered 60 percent of the country as recently as fifty years ago but today according to more in-depth environmental analysis the country yields approximately 30 percent tree cover a stark difference from the often cited 2 percent which has been widely circulated in discourse concerning Haiti.134  scientists at the columbia universitys center for international earth science information network and the united nations environment programme are working on the haiti regenerative initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource management.135  government and politicsedit  main article politics of haiti  voting in the 2006 elections in port-au-prince  the government of haiti is a semi-presidential republic a multiparty system wherein the president of haiti is head of state elected directly by popular elections.136 the prime minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the president chosen from the majority party in the national assembly executive power is exercised by the president and prime minister who together constitute the government in 2013, the annual budget was US1 billion.137  legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the national assembly of haiti the government is organized unitarily thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent the current structure of haitis political system was set forth in the constitution of haiti on 29 march 1987.  haitian politics have been contentious since independence haiti has suffered 32 coups.138 haiti is the only country in the western hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution but a long history of oppression by dictators including franois duvalier and his son jean-claude duvalier has markedly affected the nation france the united states and other western countries have repeatedly intervened in haitian politics since the countrys founding sometimes at the request of one party or another along with international financial institutions they have imposed large quantities of debt so much that foreign debt payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending there have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on haiti that are considered by some to be detrimental to local industry.139  according to a corruption perceptions index report in 2006, there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty and haiti ranked first of all countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption.140 the international red cross reports that seven out of ten haitians live on less than US2 a day however stated below statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average haitian and haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily the disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are in the haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question for various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter for some it is because none of your business for others they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them.141  cit soleil in port-au-prince one of the biggest slums in the northern hemisphere has been called most dangerous place on earth by the united Nations.142 many residents are supporters of former haitian president jean-bertrand Aristide,143 who according to the bbc the us of forcing him out an accusation the us rejected as  jean-bertrand aristide was initially denied access to haiti by haitian immigration authorities despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers the worlds most prominent governments did not overtly oppose such appeals nor did they support them an unnamed analyst to the haitian government quoted in several media sources including the new york times is reported to have said could have 15 passports and hes still not going to come back to haiti france and the united states are standing in the way however aristide finally returned to haiti on 18 march 2011, days before the 2011 presidential election.145  us marines patrol the streets of port-au-prince on 14 april 2004  the first round of the 2010 general election was held in december mirlande manigat and jude celestin qualified for the second round of the presidential election but its results were contested some people said that the first round was a fraud and that michel martelly should replace jude celestin ren prvals chosen successor there was some violence between the contending parties.146 on 4 april 2011, the provisional electoral council announced preliminary results indicating that martelly had won the presidential election.147  after the us funded million148 to legislative and presidential elections in august and october 2015, a special verification panel implemented by interim president joceleme privert declared the results by significant fraud.149 jovenel mose the supposed winner of the october 25, 2015 election had been hand-picked by former president michel martelly the month-long examination in may 2016 was created after the elections were condemned as fraudulent to restore credibility to the process.150 the commission recommended completely redoing the vote after auditing a random sample of about 13,000 ballots.149  in february 2012, haiti signaled it would seek to upgrade its observer status to full associate member status of the african union the au was reported to be planning to upgrade haitis status from observer to associate at its june 2013 summit152 but the application had still not been ratified by may 2016.153  in 2010, the haitian national police force numbered 7,000.154 the legal system for torts is based on a version of the napoleonic Code.155  the institute for the protection of national heritage has preserved 33 historical monuments

haitian national police which has a highly trained swat team and works alongside the haitian coast guard  law enforcement and crimeedit  main articles haitian national police and crime in haiti  law enforcement in haiti is maintained primarily by police forces for each department the direction dpartement de louest in port-au-prince is one of the six offices in the metropolitan area.162  haiti has consistently ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world on the corruption perceptions Index.163 it is estimated that president doc duvalier his wife michelle and their agents stole us million from the countrys treasury between 1971 and 1986.164 similarly after the haitian army folded in 1995, the haitian national police gained sole power of authority on the haitian citizens many haitians as well as observers of the haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force.165  similarly some media outlets alleged that millions were stolen by former president jean-bertrand Aristide.166167168169 in march 2004, at the time of aristides being kidnapped a bbc article wrote that the bush administration state department stated that aristide had been involved in drug trafficking.170 the bbc also described pyramid schemes in which haitians lost hundreds of millions in 2002, as the real economic initiative of the aristide years.171  conversely according to the 2013 united nations office on drugs and crime report murder rates in haiti per 100,000 are far below the regional average per 100,000 less than that of jamaica per 100,000 and nearly that of the dominican republic per 100,000, making it among the safer countries in the region.172173 in large part this is due to the countrys ability to fulfill a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012. in addition to the yearly recruits the haitian national police has been using innovative technologies to crack down on crime a notable bust in recent yearswhen led to the dismantlement of the largest kidnapping ring in the country with the use of an advanced software program developed by a west point-trained haitian official that proved to be so effective that it has led to its foreign advisers to make inquiries.174175  in 2010, the new york city police department sent a team of veteran officers to haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth it has also helped the hnp set up a police unit in the center of delmas a neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.176177178  in 2012 and 2013, 150 hnp officers received specialized training funded by the us government which also contributed to the infrastructure and communications support by upgrading radio capacity and constructing new police
