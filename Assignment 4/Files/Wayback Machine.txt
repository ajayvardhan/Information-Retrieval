2017 how and when to remove this template message  the internet archive launched the wayback machine in october 2001.45 it was set up by brewster kahle and bruce gilliat and is maintained with content from alexa internetcitation needed the service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time which the archive calls a dimensional indexcitation needed  since 1996, the wayback machine has been archiving cached pages of websites onto its large cluster of linux nodescitation needed it revisits sites on occasion technical details below and archives a new version.6 sites can also be captured on the fly by visitors who enter the sites url into a search boxcitation needed the intent is to capture and archive content that otherwise would be lost whenever a site is changed or closed downcitation needed the overall vision of the machines creators is to archive the entire internetcitation needed  information had been kept on digital tape for five years with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database.7 when the archive reached its fifth anniversary in 2001, it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the university of california Berkeley.8  the name wayback machine was chosen as a reference to the machine way-back a time-traveling device used by the characters mr peabody and sherman in the rocky and bullwinkle show an animated cartoon.910 in one of the animated cartoons component segments peabodys improbable history the characters routinely used the machine to witness participate in and more often than not alter famous events in historycitation needed  technical detailsedit  software has been developed to the web and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages the gopher hierarchy the netnews bulletin board system and downloadable software.11 the information collected by these does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archive-itorg was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives.12  crawl are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the Archive.6 for example crawls are contributed by the sloan foundation and alexa crawls run by ia on behalf of nara and the internet memory foundation mirrors of common Crawl.6 the web crawls have been running since 2010 and capture the global web.136  the frequency of snapshot captures varies per website.6 websites in the web crawls are included in a list with the site archived once per crawl.6 a crawl can take months or even years to complete depending on size.6 for example crawl number 13 started on january 9, 2015 and completed on july 11, 2016.14 however there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time and a site might be included in more than one crawl list so how often a site is crawled varies widely.6  storage capabilitiesedit  as of 2009update, the wayback machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of 100 terabytes each month15 the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytesmonth the data is stored on petabox rack systems manufactured by capricorn Technologies.16  in 2009, the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to sun open storage and hosts a new data center in a sun modular datacenter on sun microsystems california campus.17  in 2011 a new improved version of the wayback machine with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing.18  in march 2011, it was said on the wayback machine forum that beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled materials into 2010, and will continue to be updated regularly the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008, and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year.19  in january 2013, the company announced a ground-breaking milestone of 240 billion URLs.20  in october 2013, the company announced the a page feature21 which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url this became a threat of abuse by the service for hosting malicious binaries.2223  as of december 2014update, the wayback machine contained almost nine petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of about 20 terabytes each week.24  as of july 2016update, the wayback machine reportedly contained around 15 petabytes of data.25  growthedit  between october 2013 and march 2015 the websites global alexa rank changed from 16226 to 208.27  wayback machine growth2829303132333435363738  year  pages archived  2005  40  2008  85  2012  150  2013  373  2014  400  2015  452  website exclusion policyedit  historically wayback machine respected the robots exclusion standard in determining if a website would be crawled or not or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable website owners had the option to opt-out of wayback machine through the use of robotstxt it applied robotstxt rules retroactively if a site blocked the internet archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well in addition the internet archive stated a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site we comply with these requests.39 in addition the website says internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection.40  oakland archive policyedit  waybacks retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon recommendations for managing removal requests and preserving archival integrity published by the school of information management and systems at university of california berkeley in 2002, which gives a website owner the right block access to the sites archives wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation.42  the wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017, when it stopped honoring robotstxt on us government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages as of april 2017, wayback is exploring ignoring robotstxt more broadly not just for us government websites.43444546  usesedit  this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it 2017  the site is frequently used by journalists and citizens to review dead websites dated news reports or changes to website contents its content has been used to hold politicians accountable and expose battlefield lies.47  in 2014 an archived social media page of separatist rebel leader in ukraine igor girkin showed him boasting about his troops having shot down a suspected ukrainian military airplane before it became known that the plane actually was a civilian malaysian airlines jet after which he deleted the post and blamed ukraines military.4748  in 2017 the march for science originated from a discussion on reddit that indicated someone had visited archiveorg and discovered that all references to climate change had been deleted from the white house website in response a user commented needs to be a scientists march on Washington.495051  furthermore the site is used heavily for verification providing access to references and content creation by wikipedia editorscitation needed  in legal evidenceedit  civil litigationedit  netbula llc v chordiant software incedit  in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robotstxt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbulas site pages that chordiant believed would support its case.52  netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbulas website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly.53 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiants motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations.52  magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbulas arguments and ordered them to disable the robotstxt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought.52  telewizja polskaedit  in an october 2004 case telewizja polska usa inc v echostar satellite no 02 c 3293, 65 fed r evid serv 673 ill oct 15, 2004, a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time telewizja polska is the provider of tvp polonia and echostar operates the dish network prior to the trial proceedings echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polskas website telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polskas assertion of hearsay and denied tvps motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial.5455 at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys findingscitation needed and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages the telewizja polska website were admissible as evidence judge guzman reasoned that the employees affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticatingcitation needed  patent lawedit  main article internet as a source of prior art  provided some additional requirements are met providing an authoritative statement of the archivist the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application.56  limitations of utilityedit  there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives.57  legal statusedit  in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator.58 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site.59  archived content legal issuesedit  a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts  scientologyedit  see also scientology and the internet  in late 2002, the internet archive removed various sites that were critical of scientology from the wayback Machine.60 an error message stated that this was in response to a by the site owner.61 later it was clarified that lawyers from the church of scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed.62  healthcare advocates incedit  in 2003, harding earley follmer frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archives wayback machine the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid based on the content of their website from several years prior the plaintiff healthcare advocates then amended their complaint to include the internet archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robotstxt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on Wayback.63 the lawsuit was settled out of court after wayback fixed the problem.64  suzanne shelledit  in december 2005, activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us for archiving her website profane-justiceorg between 1999 and 2004.6566 internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20, 2006, seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shells copyright shell responded and brought a countersuit against internet archive for archiving her site which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service.67 on february 13, 2007, a judge for the united states district court for the district of colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract.66 the internet archive did not move to dismiss copyright infringement claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities which would also go forward.68  on april 25, 2007, internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit.65 the internet archive said it no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation shell said respect the historical value of internet archives goal i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm.69  daniel davydiukedit  in 201316, a pornographic actor tried to remove archived images of himself from the wayback machines archive first by sending multiple dmca requests to the archive and then by appealing to the federal court of Canada.707172  censorship and other threatsedit  archiveorg is currently blocked in China.7374 after the site enabled the encrypted https protocol the internet archive was blocked in its entirety in russia in 2015.757647needs update  alison macrina director of the library freedom project notes that librarians deeply value individual privacy we also strongly oppose censorship.47  there are known rare cases where online access to content which nothing has put people in danger was disabled.47  other threats include natural disasters,77 destruction or physicalcitation needed manipulation of the archives contents also cyberattack backup problematic copyright laws78 and surveillance of the sites users.79  kevin vaughan suspects that in the long-term of multiple generations to nothing will survive in a useful way besides we have continuity in our technological civilization by which lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable.80  some find the internet archive which describes itself to be built for the long-term,81 to be working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long-term infrastructure to speak of.82  see alsoedit  collective memory  national memory  deep web  heritrix  the memory hole  webcite  library genesis  web archiving
