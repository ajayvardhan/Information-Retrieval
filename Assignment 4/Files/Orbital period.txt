and applies in astronomy usually to planets or asteroids orbiting the sun moons orbiting planets exoplanets orbiting other stars or binary stars  for objects in the solar system this is often referred to as the sidereal period determined by a 360 revolution of one celestial body around another eg the earth orbiting the sun the name sidereal is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the fixed stars projected in the sky when describing orbits of binary stars the orbital period is usually referred to as just the period for example jupiter has a sidereal period of 11.86 years while the main binary star alpha centauri ab has a period of about 79.91 years  another important orbital period definition can refer to the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earths surface an example is the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the sun for example jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from earth thus jupiters opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months  periods in astronomy are conveniently expressed in various units of time often in hours days or years they can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal gravitational influences by other celestial objects such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies perturbations by other planets or bodies orbital resonance general relativity etc most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using celestial mechanics using precise positional

 there are many periods related to the orbits of objects each of which are often used in the various fields of astronomy and astrophysics examples of some of the common ones include  the sidereal period is the amount of time that it takes an object to make a full orbit relative to the stars this is the orbital period in an inertial frame of reference  the synodic period is the amount of time that it takes for an object to reappear at the same point in relation to two or more other objects the moons phase and its position relative to the sun and earth repeats every 29.5 day synodic period longer than its 27.3 day orbit around the earth due to the motion of the earth about the sun the time between two successive oppositions or conjunctions is also an example of the synodic period for the planets in the solar system the synodic period respect to earth differs from the sidereal period due to the earths orbiting around the sun  the draconitic period or draconic period is the time that elapses between two passages of the object through its ascending node the point of its orbit where it crosses the ecliptic from the southern to the northern hemisphere this period differs from the sidereal period because both the orbital plane of the object and the plane of the ecliptic precess with respect to the fixed stars so their intersection the line of nodes also precesses with respect to the fixed stars although the plane of the ecliptic is often held fixed at the position it occupied at a specific epoch the orbital plane of the object still precesses causing the draconitic period to differ from the sidereal period  the anomalistic period is the time that elapses between two passages of an object at its periapsis the case of the planets in the solar system called the perihelion the point of its closest approach to the attracting body it differs from the sidereal period because the objects semi-major axis typically advances slowly  also the earths tropical period simply its is the time that elapses between two alignments of its axis of rotation with the sun also viewed as two passages of the object at right ascension zero one earth year has a slightly shorter interval than the solar orbit period because the inclined axis and equatorial plane slowly precess with respect to the stars realigning with the sun before the orbit completes the earths precession cycle completes in about 25,770 yearscitation needed  small body orbiting a central bodyedit  the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of an ellipse  according to keplers third law the orbital period t seconds of two bodies orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit iscitation needed  where  a is the orbits semi-major axis in meters  gm is the standard gravitational parameter in m3s2  g is the gravitational constant  m is the mass of the more massive body  for all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same regardless of eccentricity  inversely for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to pulse a given orbital period  where  a is the orbits semi-major axis in meters  g is the gravitational constant  m is the mass of the more massive body  t is the orbital period in seconds  for instance for completing an orbit every 24hours around a mass of 100kg, a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08meters from its center of mass  orbital period as a function of central bodys densityedit  when a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density kgm3, the above equation simplifies to m v 43a31  so for the earth as the central body any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density about 5,515kgm32 we get  t 1.41 hours  and for a body made of water  t 3.30 hours  thus as an alternative for using a very small number like g the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material like water the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes conversely this can be used as a kind of unit of time if we have a unit of mass a unit of length and a unit of density  two bodies orbiting each otheredit  in celestial mechanics when both orbiting bodies masses have to be taken into account the orbital period t can be calculated as follows4  where  a is the sum of the semi-major axes of the ellipses in which the centers of the bodies move or equivalently the semi-major axis of the ellipse in which one body moves in the frame of reference with the other body at the origin is equal to their constant separation for circular orbits  M1 M2 is the sum of the masses of the two bodies  g is the gravitational constant  note that the orbital period is independent of size for a scale model it would be the same when densities are the same also orbitscaling in gravitycitation needed  in a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory the motion is not periodic and the duration of the full trajectory is infinite  synodic periodedit  there are observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits and thus have different orbital periods this is known as their synodic period it is the time between conjunctions and since it is observable from either the first or the second body the two synodic periods will be different depending from which celestial body you are observing  an example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earths surface the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the sun for example jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from earth thus jupiters opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months  if the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called P1 and P2, so that P1P2, their synodic period is given bycitation needed  examples of sidereal and synodic periodsedit  table of synodic periods in the solar system relative to earthcitation needed  object

planets moon the synodic period usually means the sun-synodic period namely the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planets surface the earths motion does not determine this value for other planets because an earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question for example deimoss synodic period is 1.2648days, 0.18
