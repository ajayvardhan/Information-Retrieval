hurricane was based on the earlier go-devil flathead engine to get more power from the engine the induction system was changed from the go-devils side-valve configuration to an inlet-over-exhaust configuration or this allowed the valves to be larger and the combustion chamber to be smaller improving flow and increasing the compression ratio.2 the compression ratio rose from 6.51 in the go-devil engine to 7.51 in the hurricane engine although a version of the hurricane engine was made with a 6.91 compression ratio.3  F134edit  the L134 go devil was updated with the f-head to become the F134 in 1950.45 this engine produced a gross output of 75hp 76PS at 4000rpm and 114lbft of torque at 2000rpm with a 7.51 compression ratio the gross power and torque outputs fell to 72hp 73PS and 112lbft respectively when the engine had a 6.91 compression ratio bore and stroke dimensions were the same as the l-head engine at 318 x 438 giving 134.2cuin  the F4-134 was introduced in 1950 in the jeep Truck.4 vehicles with this engine were given the model designation 4-73.6 this engine was not placed in a cj until the introduction of the CJ-3B in 1953, which had a distinctive high hood to accommodate the much taller engine.2 the engine remained in production until 1971, after american motors corporation purchased kaiser jeep  applications  19501961 willys jeep truck  19501961 willys

is an f-head version of the L6-161 lightning flathead straight six it was used in the model 685 station Wagon.7  BF-161 the BF-161 has a 318 inch bore and a 312 inch stroke a one-barrel carburetor and an output of 90hp 91PS at 4400rpm and 135lbft of torque at 2000rpm. its 161.1cuin displacement features a compression ratio of 7.61.8  2600 the 2600 was essentially the same BF-161 engine made in brazil by willys-overlands subsidiary but it had two one-barrel carburetors opened and had an output of 130hp 132PS at 4400rpm and 140lbft of torque at 2000rpm. the compression ratio remained 7.61.8  3000 the 3-liter version is almost identical to the BF-161 engine with the stroke increased to 4 inches giving it a displacement of 3,016cc with a 2-barrel carburetor it produced 140hp 142PS at 4400rpm and 161lbft of torque at 2000rpm. it also had a slightly higher compression ratio of 81.8 it initially used a different head with removable intake manifold later after ford acquired willys-overland do brasil they reverted the engine to its former head design with integral intake manifold improved cooling between cylinders 5 and 6 and installed a side-mounted oil filter instead of the front-mounted hose connected arrangement used by willys  applications  19611962 willys aero  19631971 willys aero 2600  1960-1974 willys-overland jeep and rural willys  19681971 willys itamaraty

Continental11 with a bore of 3516inches and stroke of 438inches, giving a displacement of 226.2cuin horsepower rating is 105hp 106PS at 3600rpm or 115hp 117PS at 3650rpm,12 as well as a torque rating of 190lbft at 1400rpm or at 1800rpm,12 depending on the year of production  mitsubishi versionsedit  mitsubishi built a version of the hurricane from 1954 as the JH4 hp mostly for use in their license-built version of the Jeep.13 they later developed a 61PS overhead-valve diesel version of the same called KE31. this was also turned into a 3.3 liter six-cylinder version with the same internal dimensions producing 85PS which was named KE36. these diesel engines were used in the jeep but also in a number of light to medium-weight trucks and buses.14  referencesedit  a b specs jeep
