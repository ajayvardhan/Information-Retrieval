south pacific tropical cyclone  from south pacific tropical cyclone season  a south pacific tropical cyclone is a non frontal low pressure system that has developed within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and little vertical wind shear aloft in the south pacific Ocean.1 within the southern hemisphere there are officially three areas where tropical cyclones develop on a regular basis these areas are the south-west indian ocean between africa and 90E, the australian region between 90E and 160E and the south pacific basin between 160E and 120W. the south pacific basin between 160E and 120W is officially monitored by the fiji meteorological service and new zealands metservice while others like the australian bureau of meteorology and the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration also monitor the basin each tropical cyclone year within this basin starts on july 1 and runs throughout the year encompassing the tropical cyclone season which runs from november 1 and lasts until april 30 each season within the basin most tropical cyclones have their origins within the south pacific convergence zone or within the northern australian monsoon trough both of which form an extensive area of cloudiness and are dominant features of the season within this region a tropical disturbance is classified as a tropical cyclone when it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65kmh that wrap halfway around the low level circulation centre while a severe tropical cyclone is classified when the maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds are greater than 120kmh  contents  1 basin history  2 warning centers  3 seasons  3.1 1970s  3.2 1980s  3.3 1990s  3.4 2000s  3.5 2010s  4 see also  5 notes  6 references  7 external links  basin historyedit  the ancient mariners of the south seas who roamed the tropical pacific before the arrival of the europeans knew of and feared the hurricanes of the south Pacific.2 they were keen and accurate observers of nature with traditional myths and legends reflecting their knowledge of these systems.2 on his voyages around the pacific it is thought that captain james cook did not collect any information about cyclones in the Pacific.2 the european whalers traders and missionaries that followed cook soon realised that the south pacific was not free of hurricanes and were the first to publish accounts about the systems.2 during 1853, thomas dobson subsequently became the first person to collect information about these systems in order to attempt to understand and explain the characteristics of 24 tropical cyclones.2 however these descriptions were vague and of little value because he only had a small amount of data and no synoptic weather charts.2 over the next 40 years various reports journals and log books on the storms were published before e knipping consolidated these reports and extended dobsons list out to 120 tropical cyclones during 1893.2 during the 1920s stephen sargent visher did some research into tropical cyclones in the pacific and visited several island nations including fiji japan and the philippines to obtain information on potential systems.3 he also consulted various journals and reports as well as dobsons and knippings work before he authored a number of papers on tropical cyclones in the Pacific.3 these papers contained information about 259 tropical storms in the south pacific between 160E and 140W, two of which occurred during 1789 and 1819, while the rest occurred between 1830 and 1923.2 visher also tried to estimate how many systems were occurring on an annual basis in each area but overcompensated for his incomplete records and came up with a figure of 12 severe tropical cyclones per year.23  during vishers time and until the start of world war two there was insufficient information available to allow for an accurate deception of tropical cyclone tracks.2 however in the buildup to and during world war two meteorological operations in the pacific were greatly expanded to meet the needs of international aviation and military operations.24 as a result j w hutchings decided to write a paper on 43 tropical cyclones between 1940 and 1951, using data that had been collected from the tropics by the new zealand meteorological service in the area between the 150E and 150W.4 in the paper systems were only included if they had a wind speed on the beaufort scale of force 9 or above while located between the equator and 30S.4 hutchings also examined where tropical cyclones originated from in the south pacific and claimed that the place where most tropical cyclones develop could be accurately determined.24 the paper also drew attention to a marked difference in the tracks of south pacific tropical cyclones and systems in other basins.4 this work was subsequently extended in 1956, by the then director of the new zealand meteorological service john fletcher gabites to cover the seasons between 195253 and 195556.5 gabites subsequently wrote a series of papers during 1963 on various aspects of south pacific tropical cyclones including on the wide variety of tracks that occur over the Pacific.2  warning
