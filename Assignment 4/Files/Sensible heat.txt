sensible heat  sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system in which the exchange of heat changes the temperature of the body or system and some macroscopic variables of the body or system but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables of the body or system such as volume or pressure.1234  usageedit  thermodynamics  the classical carnot heat engine  branches

heat which is the amount of heat exchanged that is hidden meaning it occurs without change of temperature for example during a phase change such as the melting of ice the temperature of the system containing the ice and the liquid is constant until all ice has melted the terms latent and sensible are correlative that means that they are defined as a pair depending on which other macroscopic variables are held constant during the process  the sensible heat of a thermodynamic process may be calculated as the product of the bodys mass with its specific heat capacity and the change in temperature  joule described sensible heat as the energy measured by a thermometer  sensible heat and latent heat are not special forms of energy rather they describe exchanges of heat under conditions specified in terms of their effect on a material or a thermodynamic system  in the writings of the early scientists who provided the foundations of thermodynamics sensible heat had a clear meaning in calorimetry james prescott joule characterized it in 1847 as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer.5  both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes while transporting energy in nature latent heat is associated with changes of state measured at constant temperature especially the phase changes of atmospheric water vapor mostly vaporization and condensation whereas sensible heat directly affects the temperature of the atmosphere  in meteorology the term heat flux means the conductive heat flux from the earths surface to the atmosphere.6 it is an important component of earths surface energy budget sensible heat flux is commonly measured with the eddy covariance method  see alsoedit  enthalpy  thermodynamic databases for pure substances
