ramon  inquiries  columbia accident investigation board  on february 1, 2003, the space shuttle columbia disintegrated upon reentering earths atmosphere killing all seven crew members  the disaster was the second fatal accident in the space shuttle program after space shuttle challenger which broke apart and killed the seven-member crew 73 seconds after liftoff in 1986.  during the launch of STS-107, columbias 28th mission a piece of foam insulation broke off from the space shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter a few previous shuttle launches had seen damage ranging from minor to major from foam shedding,12 but some engineers suspected that the damage to columbia was more serious nasa managers limited the investigation reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed.3  when columbia re-entered the atmosphere of earth the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart.4  after the disaster space shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years as they had been after the challenger disaster construction of the international space station was put on hold the station relied entirely on the russian roscosmos state corporation for resupply for 29 months until shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121.  several technical and organizational changes were made including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttles thermal protection system had endured the ascent and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found except for one final mission to repair the hubble space telescope subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the iss so that the crew could use it as a haven in case damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry  contents  1 crew  2 debris strike during launch  3

bipod foam ramp video  space shuttle external tank foam block  close-up of the left bipod foam ramp that broke off and damaged the shuttle wing  the shuttles main fuel tank is covered in thermal insulation foam intended to prevent ice from forming when the tank is full of liquid hydrogen and oxygen such ice could damage the shuttle if shed during lift-off  mission STS-107 was the 113th space shuttle launch planned to begin on january 11, 2001, the mission was delayed 18times5 and eventually launched on january 16, 2003, following STS-113. columbia accident investigation board determined that this delay had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure.5  about 82seconds after launch from kennedy space centers LC-39-A, a suitcase-sized piece of foam broke off from the external tank striking columbias left wing reinforced carbon-carbon panels as demonstrated by ground experiments conducted by the columbia accident investigation board this likely created a 6-to-10-inch to 25cm diameter hole allowing hot gases to enter the wing when columbia later re-entered the atmosphere at the time of the foam strike the orbiter was at an altitude of about 66,000 feet 12.5mi, traveling at Mach2.46 miles per hour or 727 meters per second  the left bipod foam ramp is an approximately three-foot long aerodynamic component made entirely of foam the foam not normally considered to be a structural material is required to bear some aerodynamic loads because of these special requirements the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician.6 the bipod ramp left and right sides was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank but it was proven unnecessary in the wake of the accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source after analysis and tests proved this change safe  bipod ramp insulation had been observed falling off in whole or in part on four previous flights STS-7 STS-32 STS-50 and most recently STS-112 two launches before STS-107. all affected shuttle missions completed successfully nasa management came to refer to this phenomenon as shedding as with the o-ring erosion problems that ultimately doomed the space shuttle challenger nasa management became accustomed to these phenomena when no serious consequences resulted from these earlier episodes this phenomenon was termed of deviance by sociologist diane vaughan in her book on the challenger launch decision process.7  as it happened STS-112 had been the first flight with the cam a video feed mounted on the et for the purpose of giving greater insight to the foam shedding problem during that launch a chunk of foam broke away from the et bipod ramp and hit the srb-et attach ring near the bottom of the left solid rocket booster causing a dent four inches wide and three inches deep in it.8 after STS-112, nasa leaders analyzed the situation and decided to press ahead under the justification that et is safe to fly with no new concerns no added risk of further foam strikes.9  video taken during lift-off of STS-107 was routinely reviewed two hours later and revealed nothing unusual the following day higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing potentially damaging the thermal protection on the space Shuttle.10 at the time the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage  meanwhile nasas judgment about the risks was revisited linda ham chair of the mission management team said was lousy then and still is ham and shuttle program manager ron dittemore had both been present at the october 31, 2002, meeting where the decision to continue with launches was made.11  post-disaster analysis revealed that two previous shuttle launches and also had bipod ramp foam loss that went undetected in addition protuberance air load ramp foam had also shed pieces and there were also spot losses from large-area foams  flight risk managementedit  in a risk-management scenario similar to the challenger disaster nasa management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage and failed to respond to engineers requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing engineers made three separate requests for department of defense imaging of the shuttle in orbit to determine damage more precisely while the images were not guaranteed to show the damage the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination nasa management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the dod from assisting.12 the caib recommended subsequent shuttle flights be imaged while in orbit using ground-based or space-based dod assets.13 details of the dods unfulfilled participation with columbia remain secret retired nasa official wayne hale stated in 2012 that regarding other national assets and agencies remains classified and i cannot comment on that aspect of the columbia tragedy.14  throughout the risk assessment process senior nasa managers were influenced by their belief that nothing could be done even if damage were detected this affected their stance on investigation urgency thoroughness and possible contingency actions they decided to conduct a parametric scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage the investigation report in particular singled out nasa manager linda ham for exhibiting this attitude.15 in 2013, hale recalled that director of mission operations jon c harpold told him before columbias destruction  you know there is nothing we can do about damage to the tps protection system if it has been damaged its probably better not to know i think the crew would rather not know dont you think it would be better for them to have a happy successful flight and die unexpectedly during entry than to stay on orbit knowing that there was nothing to be done until the air ran out16  much of the risk assessment hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system these fall into two categories damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface and damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading-edge panels the tps includes a third category of components thermal insulating blankets but damage predictions are not typically performed on them damage assessments on the thermal blankets can be performed after an anomaly has been observed and this has been done at least once after the return to flight following columbias loss  before the flight nasa believed that the rcc was very durable charles f bolden who worked on tile-damage scenarios and repair methods early in his astronaut career said in 2004 that17  never did we talk about rcc because we all thought that it was impenetrable i spent fourteen years in the space program flying thinking that i had this huge mass that was about five or six inches thick on the leading edge of the wing and to find after columbia that it was fractions of an inch thick and that it wasnt as strong as the fiberglass on your corvette that was an eye-opener and i think for all of us the best minds that i know of in and outside of nasa never envisioned that as a failure mode  damage-prediction software was used to evaluate possible tile and rcc damage the tool for predicting tile damage was known as described by several nasa representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects the tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the tps tile area but nasa engineers downplayed this it had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger spray-on foam insulation impacts the program used to predict rcc damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts not larger sofi impacts as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to rcc panels up to that point under one of 15 predicted sofi impact paths the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the rcc panel engineers downplayed this too believing that impacts of the less dense sofi material would result in less damage than ice impacts in an e-mail exchange nasa managers questioned whether the density of the sofi could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the sofi material nasa managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the rcc panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panels thin coating.18  ultimately the nasa mission management team felt there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the strike was an unsafe situation so they declared the debris strike a issue of highest importance and denied the requests for the department of defense images  on january 23, flight director steve stich sent an e-mail to columbia informing commander husband and pilot mccool of the foam strike while unequivocally dismissing any concerns about entry safety.1920  during ascent at approximately 80 seconds photo analysis shows that some debris from the area of the et bipod attach point came loose and subsequently impacted the orbiter left wing in the area of transition from chine to main wing creating a shower of smaller particles the impact appears to be totally on the lower surface and no particles are seen to traverse over the upper surface of the wing experts have reviewed the high speed photography and there is no concern for rcc or tile damage we have seen this same phenomenon on several other flights and there is absolutely no concern for entry.21  edward tufte an expert in information design and presentation,22 remarked on poor modes of communication during the assessment made on the ground before columbias reentry nasa and boeing favored microsoft powerpoint for conveying information powerpoint uses multi-level bullet points and orients towards single-page-of-information groupings this is not ideal for complex scientific and engineering reports and may have caused recipients to draw incorrect conclusions in particular the slide format may have emphasized optimistic options and glossed over the more accurate pessimistic viewpoints.23  re-entry timelineedit  columbia was scheduled to land at 916a.m. est  230a.m. est february 1, 2003 the entry flight control team began duty in the mission control center today as the christopher c kraft jr mission control center  the flight control team had not been working on any issues or problems related to the planned de-orbit and re-entry of columbia in particular the team had indicated no concerns about the debris that hit the left wing during ascent and treated the re-entry like any other the team worked through the de-orbit preparation checklist and re-entry checklist procedures weather forecasters with the help of pilots in the shuttle training aircraft evaluated landing-site weather conditions at the kennedy space center  800 mission control center entry flight director leroy cain polled the mission control room for a gono-go decision for the de-orbit burn  all weather observations and forecasts were within guidelines set by the flight rules and all systems were normal  810 the capsule communicator told the crew that they were go for de-orbit burn  81530 husband and mccool executed the de-orbit burn using columbias two orbital maneuvering system engines  the orbiter was upside down and tail-first over the indian ocean at an altitude of 175 miles and speed of 17,500 miles per hour when the burn was executed a 2-minute, 38-second de-orbit burn during the 255th orbit slowed the orbiter to begin its re-entry into the atmosphere the burn proceeded normally putting the crew under about one-tenth gravity husband then turned columbia right side up facing forward with the nose pitched up  84409 entry interface arbitrarily defined as the point at which the orbiter entered the discernible atmosphere at 400,000 feet 76mi, occurred over the pacific ocean  as columbia descended the heat of reentry caused wing leading-edge temperatures to rise steadily reaching an estimated 2,500F during the next six minutes former space shuttle program manager wayne hale said in a press briefing about 90 of this heating is the result of compression of the atmospheric gas caused by the orbiters supersonic flight rather than the result of friction  columbia at about 857. debris is visible coming from the left wing the image was taken at starfire optical range at kirtland air force base  84839 a sensor on the left wing leading edge spar showed strains higher than those seen on previous columbia re-entries  this was recorded only on the modular auxiliary data system which is similar in concept to a flight data recorder and was not sent to ground controllers or shown to the crew  84932 columbia executed a planned roll to the right speed mach 24.5.  columbia began a banking turn to manage lift and therefore limit the orbiters rate of descent and heating  85053 columbia entered a 10-minute period of peak heating during which the thermal stresses were at their maximum speed mach 24.1 altitude 243,000 feet 46.0mi.  85200 columbia was about 300 miles west of the california coastline  the wing leading-edge temperatures usually reached 2,650F at this point  85326 columbia crossed the california coast west of sacramento speed mach 23 altitude 231,600 feet 43.86mi.  columbia debris red orange and yellow detected by national weather service radar over texas and louisiana  the orbiters wing leading edge typically reached more than 2,800F at this point  85346 various people on the ground saw signs of debris being shed speed mach 22.8 altitude 230,200 feet 43.60mi.  the superheated air surrounding the orbiter suddenly brightened causing a streak in the orbiters luminescent trail that was quite noticeable in the pre-dawn skies over the west coast observers witnessed four similar events during the following 23seconds. dialogue on some of the amateur footage indicates the observers were aware of the abnormality of what they were filming  85424 the maintenance mechanical and crew systems officer told the flight director that four hydraulic sensors in the left wing were indicating low in mission control re-entry had been proceeding normally up to this point  low is a reading that falls below the minimum capability of the sensor and it usually indicates that the sensor has stopped functioning due to internal or external factors not that the quantity it measures is actually below the sensors minimum response value  85425 columbia crossed from california into nevada airspace speed mach 22.5 altitude 227,400 feet 43.07mi.  witnesses observed a bright flash at this point and 18 similar events in the next four minutes  85500 nearly 11 minutes after columbia re-entered the atmosphere wing leading-edge temperatures normally reached nearly 3,000F  85532 columbia crossed from nevada into utah speed mach 21.8 altitude 223,400 feet 42.31mi.  85552 columbia crossed from utah into arizona  85630 columbia began a roll reversal turning from right to left over arizona  85645 columbia crossed from arizona to new mexico speed mach 20.9 altitude 219,000 feet 41.5mi.  85724 columbia passed just north of albuquerque  85800 at this point wing leading-edge temperatures typically decreased to 2,880F  85820 columbia crossed from new mexico into texas speed mach 19.5 altitude 209,800 feet 39.73mi.  at about this time the orbiter shed a thermal protection system tile the most westerly piece of debris that has been recovered searchers found the tile in a field in littlefield texas just northwest of lubbock  85915 mmacs told the flight director that pressure readings had been lost on both left main landing-gear tires the flight director then instructed the capsule communicator to let the crew know that mission control saw the messages and was evaluating the indications and added that the flight control team did not understand the crews last transmission  85932 a broken response from the mission commander was recorded uh bu off in mid-word it was the last communication from the crew and the last telemetry signal received in mission control  85937 hydraulic pressure which is required to move the flight control surfaces was lost at about 85937. at that time the master alarm would have sounded for the loss of hydraulics and the shuttle would have begun to lose control starting to roll and yaw uncontrollably and the crew would have become aware of the serious problem.24  90018 videos and eyewitness reports by observers on the ground in and near dallas indicated that the orbiter had disintegrated overhead continued to break up into smaller pieces and left multiple ion trails as it continued eastward in mission control while the loss of signal was a cause for concern there was no sign of any serious problem before the orbiter broke up at 90018, the columbia cabin pressure was nominal and the crew was capable of conscious actions.24 although the crew module remained mostly intact through the breakup it was damaged enough that it lost pressure at a rate fast enough to incapacitate the crew within seconds,25 and was completely depressurized no later than 90053.  90057 the crew module intact to this point was seen breaking into small subcomponents it disappeared from view at 90110. the crew if not already dead were killed no later than this point  905 residents of north central texas particularly near tyler reported a loud boom a small concussion wave smoke trails and debris in the clear skies above the counties east of dallas  91239 after hearing of reports of the shuttle being seen to break apart entry flight director leroy cain declared a contingency leading to loss of the vehicle and alerted search-and-rescue teams in the debris area he called on the ground controller to the doors meaning no one would be permitted to enter or leave until everything needed for investigation of the accident had been secured.26 two minutes later mission control put contingency procedures into effect  crew survivability aspectsedit  in 2008, nasa released a detailed report on survivability aspects of the columbia reentry the crew would have had less than a minute between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization the structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin although they had no way of knowing that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin all evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of columbia as it began to spin out of control but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration the crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds afterwards the cabin spun around at high rpm which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail they were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets which were not designed to provide any head protection even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death  after cabin disintegration the astronauts bodies were released into the upper atmosphere and battered by extreme aerodynamic forces to 14,000 mph and temperatures the remains of the crew then fell some 200,000 feet to earth where they were also subjected to burning from aerodynamic heating the official nasa report omitted some of the more graphic details on the recovery of the remains however witnesses reported various gruesome finds such as a human heart and parts of femur bones.27  all evidence indicated that crew error was in no way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats doing these things would have added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds.28  presidential responseedit  president george w bushs address on the columbias destruction february 1, 2003  at 1404 est utc president george w bush said day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country the columbia is lost there are no survivors despite the disaster bush said cause in which they died will continueour journey into space will go on.29 bush later declared east texas a federal disaster area allowing federal agencies to help with the recovery effort.30  recovery of debrisedit  a grid on the floor is used to organize recovered debris  recovered power-head of one of columbias main engines  more than 2,000 debris fields were found in sparsely populated areas from nacogdoches in east texas where a large amount of debris fell to western louisiana and the southwestern counties of arkansas a large amount of debris was recovered between tyler texas and palestine texas one debris field has been mapped along a path stretching from south of fort worth to hemphill texas as well as into parts of Louisiana.31 various notable places that had debris included stephen f austin state university in nacogdoches and several casinos in shreveport Louisiana.31 along with pieces of the shuttle and bits of equipment searchers also found human body parts including arms feet a torso and a heart.32  in the months after the disaster the largest-ever organized ground search took place.33 thousands of volunteers descended upon texas to participate in the effort to gather the shuttles remains according to mike ciannilli project manager of the columbia research and preservation office people put their life on hold to help out the nations space program showing what space means to people.34 nasa issued warnings to the public that any debris could contain hazardous chemicals that it should be left untouched its location reported to local emergency services or government authorities and that anyone in unauthorized possession of debris would be prosecuted because of the widespread area volunteer amateur radio operators accompanied the search teams to provide communications support.35  a group of small adult caenorhabditis elegans worms living in petri dishes enclosed in aluminum canisters survived reentry and impact with the ground and were recovered weeks after the disaster.3637 the culture was found to be alive on april 28, 2003.38 the worms were part of a biological research in canisters experiment designed to study the effect of weightlessness on physiology the experiment was conducted by cassie conley nasas planetary protection officer  debris search pilot jules f mier jr and debris search aviation specialist charles krenek died in a helicopter crash that injured three others during the search.39  some texas residents recovered some of the debris ignoring the warnings and attempted to sell it on the online auction site ebay starting at the auction was quickly removed but prices for columbia merchandise such as programs photographs and patches went up dramatically following the disaster creating a surge of columbia-related listings.40 a three-day amnesty offered for shuttle debris brought in hundreds of illegally recovered pieces.41 about 40,000 recovered pieces of debris have never been identified the largest pieces recovered include the front landing gear,42 and a window frame.43  the glow of reentry as seen out the front windows  on may 9, 2008, it was reported that data from a disk drive on board columbia had survived the shuttle accident and while part of the 340MB drive was damaged 99 of the data was recovered.44 the drive was used to store data from an experiment on the properties of shear thinning.45  on july 29, 2011, nacogdoches authorities told nasa that a 4-foot diameter piece of debris had been found in a lake nasa identified the piece as a power reactant storage and distribution in citation given  all recovered non-human columbia debris is stored in unused office space at the vehicle assembly building except for parts of the crew compartment which are kept separate.47  crew cabin videoedit  play media  video taken by the crew of part of re-entry  among the recovered items was a videotape recording made by the astronauts during the start of re-entry the 13-minute recording shows the flight crew astronauts conducting routine re-entry procedures and joking with each other none gives any indication of a problem in the video the flight-deck crew puts on their gloves and passes the video camera around to record plasma and flames visible outside the windows of the orbiter normal occurrence the recording which on normal flights would have continued through landing ends about four minutes before the shuttle began to disintegrate and 11 minutes before mission control lost the signal from the orbiter.48  investigationedit  initial investigationedit  mock-up of a space shuttle leading edge made with an rcc-panel taken from discovery simulation of known and possible conditions of the foam impact on columbias final launch showed brittle fracture of rcc  nasa space shuttle program manager ron dittemore reported that first indication was loss of temperature sensors and hydraulic systems on the left wing they were followed seconds and minutes later by several other problems including loss of tire pressure indications on the left main gear and then indications of excessive structural heating.49 analysis of 31 seconds of telemetry data which had initially been filtered out because of data corruption within it showed the shuttle fighting to maintain its orientation eventually using maximum thrust from its reaction control system jets  the investigation focused on the foam strike from the very beginning incidents of debris strikes from ice and foam causing damage during take-off were already well known and had damaged orbiters most noticeably during STS-45, STS-27, and STS-87.50 after the loss of columbia nasa concluded that mistakes during installation were the likely cause of foam loss and retrained employees at michoud assembly facility in louisiana to apply foam without defects.14 tile damage had also been traced to ablating insulating material from the cryogenic fuel tank in the past the composition of the foam insulation had been changed in 1997 to exclude the use of freon a chemical that is suspected to cause ozone depletion while nasa was exempted from legislation phasing out cfcs the agency chose to change the foam nonetheless STS-107 used an older tank design that was succeeded by the tank both being upgrades from the original space shuttle external tank where the foam was sprayed on to the larger cylindrical surfaces using the newer freon-free foam however the bipod ramps were manufactured from BX-250 foam which was excluded from the epa regulations and did use the original freon formula the composition change did not contribute to the accident.51 in any case the original formulation had shown frequent foam losses as discussed earlier in this article  columbia accident investigation boardedit  main article columbia accident investigation board  following protocols established after the loss of challenger an independent investigating board was created immediately after the accident the columbia accident investigation board or caib was chaired by retired us navy admiral harold w gehman Jr.,52 and consisted of expert military and civilian analysts who investigated the accident in detail  columbias flight data recorder was found near hemphill texas on march 19, 2003.53 unlike commercial jet aircraft the space shuttles did not have flight data recorders intended for after-crash analysis instead the vehicle data were transmitted in real time to the ground via telemetry since columbia was the first shuttle it had a special flight data oex experiments recorder designed to help engineers better understand vehicle performance during the first test flights after the initial shuttle test-flights were completed the recorder was never removed from columbia and it was still functioning on the crashed flight it recorded many hundreds of parameters and contained very extensive logs of structural and other data which allowed the caib to reconstruct many of the events during the process leading to breakup.54 investigators could often use the loss of signals from sensors on the wing to track how the damage progressed.55 this was correlated with forensic debris analysis conducted at lehigh university and other tests to obtain a final conclusion about the probable course of events.56  beginning on may 30, 2003, foam impact tests were performed by southwest research institute they used a compressed air gun to fire a foam block of similar size and mass to that which struck columbia at the same estimated speed to represent the leading edge of columbias left wing rcc panels from nasa stock along with the actual leading-edge panels from enterprise which were fiberglass were mounted to a simulating structural metal frame at the beginning of testing the likely impact site was estimated to be between rcc panel 6 and 9, inclusive over many days dozens of the foam blocks were shot at the wing leading edge model at various angles these produced only cracks or surface damage to the rcc panels  during june further analysis of information from columbias flight data recorder narrowed the probable impact site to one single panel rcc wing panel 8. on july 7, in a final round of testing a block fired at the side of an rcc panel 8 created a hole 16 by 16.7 inches by 42cm in that protective rcc panel.57 the tests demonstrated that a foam impact of the type columbia sustained could seriously breach the thermal protection system on the wing leading edge.58  conclusionsedit  on august 26, 2003, the caib issued its report on the accident the report confirmed the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in the leading edge of the left wing caused by insulating foam shed during launch the report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident the report was highly critical of nasas decision-making and risk-assessment processes it concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions an example was the position of shuttle program manager where one individual was responsible for achieving safe timely launches and acceptable costs which are often conflicting goals the caib report found that nasa had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences one of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight the board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture  on december 30, 2008, nasa released a further report entitled columbia crew survival investigation report produced by a second commission the spacecraft crew survival integrated investigation team nasa had commissioned this group perform a comprehensive analysis of the accident focusing on factors and events affecting crew survival and to develop recommendations for improving crew survival for all future human space flight vehicles.59 the report concluded that columbia depressurization event occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure although circulatory systems functioned for a brief time the effects of the depressurization were severe enough that the crew could not have regained consciousness this event was lethal to the crew  the report also concluded  the crew did not have time to prepare themselves some crew members were not wearing their safety gloves and one crew member was not wearing a helmet new policies gave the crew more time to prepare for descent  the crews safety harnesses malfunctioned during the violent descent the harnesses on the three remaining shuttles were upgraded after the accident  the key recommendations of the report included that future spacecraft crew survival systems should not rely on manual activation to protect the crew.60  possible emergency proceduresedit  one question of special importance was whether nasa could have saved the astronauts had they known of the danger.61 this would have to involve either rescue or repair docking at the international space station for use as a haven while awaiting rescue to use the soyuz to systematically ferry the crew to safety would have been impossible due to the different orbital inclination of the vehicles  the caib determined that a rescue mission though risky might have been possible provided nasa management had taken action soon enough.6263 normally a rescue mission is not possible due to the time required to prepare a shuttle for launch and the limited consumables water air of an orbiting shuttle however atlantis was well along in processing for a planned march 1 launch on STS-114, and columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an extended duration orbiter package the caib determined that this would have allowed columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 15. nasa investigators determined that atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a february 10 launch hence if nothing went wrong there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue as mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle but could not control the orbiters reentry and landing it would likely have sent columbia into the pacific Ocean63 nasa later developed the remote control orbiter system to permit mission control to land a shuttle  nasa investigators determined that on-orbit repair by the shuttle astronauts was possible but overall considered risk primarily due to the uncertain resiliency of the repair using available materials and the anticipated high risk of doing additional damage to the Orbiter.6263 columbia did not carry the canadarm or remote manipulator system which would normally be used for camera inspection or transporting a spacewalking astronaut to the wing therefore an unusual emergency extra-vehicular activity would have been required while there was no astronaut eva training for maneuvering to the wing astronauts are always prepared for a similarly difficult emergency eva to close the external tank umbilical doors located on the orbiter underside which is necessary for reentry similar methods could have reached the shuttle left wing for inspection or repair.63  for the repair the caib determined that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium or other metal scavenged from the crew cabin these metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the cold of space the ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing the caib could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry and concluded that the rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing columbias crew back alive.6263  memorialsedit  on february 4, 2003, president george w bush and his wife laura led a memorial service for the astronauts families at the lyndon b johnson space center two days later vice president dick cheney and his wife lynne led a similar service at washington national cathedral patti labelle sang up there as part of the service.64  a makeshift memorial at the main entrance to the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas  columbia memorial in arlington national cemetery  columbia memorial on mars exploration rover  space

rio de janeiro sao paulo and other cities in brazil where brazilian catholic priest marcelo rossi and his concert partner belo sang a christian hymn traicoeiras nights as tribute to the seven columbia astronauts as well as the other seven crew members who lost their lives in the space shuttle challenger disaster in 1986. the concerts were televised to millions throughout brazil and the world  on march 26, the united states house of representatives science committee approved funds for the construction of a memorial at arlington national cemetery for the STS-107 crew a similar memorial was built at the cemetery for the last crew of challenger on october 28, 2003, the names of the astronauts were added to the space mirror memorial at the kennedy space center visitor complex  on april 1, 2003, the opening day of baseball season the houston astros in honor of the us space program honored the columbia crew by having seven simultaneous first pitches thrown by family and friends of the crew for the national anthem 107 nasa personnel including flight controllers and others involved in columbias final mission carried a us flag onto the field in addition the astros wore the mission patch on their sleeves and replaced all dugout advertising with the mission patch logo for the entire season.65  on february 1, 2004, the first anniversary of the columbia disaster super bowl xxxviii held in houstons reliant stadium began with a pregame tribute to the crew of the columbia by singer josh groban performing raise me up with the crew of STS-114, the first post-columbia space shuttle mission in attendance.6667  in 2004, bush conferred posthumous congressional space medals of honor to all 14 crew members lost in the challenger and columbia accidents.68  nasa named several places in honor of columbia and the crew seven asteroids discovered in july 2001 at the mount palomar observatory were officially given the names of the seven astronauts 51823 rickhusband 51824 mikeanderson

sangre de cristo range was renamed columbia point and a dedication plaque was placed on the point in august 2003. seven dormitories were named in honor of columbia crew members at the florida institute of technology creighton university the university of texas at arlington and the columbia elementary school in the brevard county school district the huntsville city schools in huntsville alabama a city strongly associated with nasa named their most recent high school columbia high school as a memorial to the crew a department of defense school in guam was renamed commander william c mccool elementary School.71 the city of palmdale california the birthplace of the entire shuttle fleet changed the name of the thoroughfare avenue m to columbia way in avondale arizona the avondale elementary school where michael andersons sister worked had sent a t-shirt with him into space it was supposed to have an assembly when he returned from space the school was later renamed michael anderson elementary  the first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by the indian space research organisation on 2 september 2002, named Metsat-1, was later renamed Kalpana-1 by indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in memory of india-born kalpana chawla  in october 2004, both houses of congress passed a resolution authored by us representative lucille roybal-allard and co-sponsored by the entire contingent of california representatives to congress changing the name of downey californias space science learning center to the columbia memorial space science learning center the facility is located at the former manufacturing site of the space shuttles including columbia and Challenger.72  the us air forces squadron officer school at maxwell air force base alabama renamed their auditorium in husbands honor he was a graduate of the program the us test pilot school at edwards air force base in california named its pilot lounge for husband  nasa named a supercomputer in the crews honor in 2004. it was located at the nasa advanced supercomputing division at ames research center on moffett federal airfield near mountain view california the first part of the system built in 2003, known as was dedicated to chawla who worked at ames prior to joining the space shuttle program.73  a us navy compound at a major coalition military base in afghanistan is named camp

laurel clark foundation in her honor.78  ps 58 in staten island new york was named space shuttle columbia school in honor of the failed mission.79  the challenger columbia stadium in league city texas is named in honor of the victims of both the columbia disaster as well as the challenger disaster in 1986.  columbia colles a range of hills on pluto discovered by the new horizons spacecraft in july 2015, was named in honor of the victims of the disaster.80  a starship on star trek enterprise was named uss columbia in honor of the columbia  effect on space programsedit  following the loss of columbia the space shuttle program was suspended.55 the further construction of the international space station was also delayed as the space shuttles were the only available delivery vehicle for station modules the station was supplied using russian unmanned progress ships and crews were exchanged using russian-manned soyuz spacecraft and forced to operate on a skeleton crew of two.8182  less than a year after the accident president bush announced the vision for space exploration calling for the space shuttle fleet to complete the iss with retirement by the year 2010 following the completion of the iss to be replaced by a newly developed crew exploration vehicle for travel to the moon and Mars.83 nasa planned to return the space shuttle to service around september 2004 that date was pushed back to july 2005.  on july 26, 2005, at 1039am est space shuttle discovery cleared the tower on the to flight mission STS-114, marking the shuttles return to space overall the STS-114 flight was highly successful but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed although the debris did not strike the orbiter due to this nasa once again grounded the shuttles until the remaining problem was understood and a solution implemented.55 after delaying their re-entry by two days due to adverse weather conditions commander eileen collins and pilot james m kelly returned discovery safely to earth on august 9, 2005. later that same month the external tank construction site at michoud was damaged by hurricane Katrina.84 at the time there was concern that this would set back further shuttle flights by at least two months and possibly more  the actual cause of the foam loss on both columbia and discovery was not determined until december 2005, when x-ray photographs of another tank showed that thermal expansion and contraction during filling not human error caused cracks that led to foam loss nasas hale formally apologized to the michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of columbia for almost three years.14  the second to flight mission STS-121, launched on july 4, 2006, at 23755pm after two previous launch attempts were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head this mission increased the iss crew to three a 5-inch crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern however the mission management team gave the go for launch.85 space shuttle discovery touched down successfully on july 17, 2006 at 91443am on runway 15 at the kennedy space center  on august 13, 2006, nasa announced that STS-121 had shed more foam than they had expected while this did not delay the launch for the next mission STS-115, originally set to lift off on august 27 the weather and other technical glitches did with a lightning strike hurricane ernesto and a faulty fuel tank sensor combining to delay the launch until september 9. on september 19, landing was delayed an extra day to examine atlantis after objects were found floating near the shuttle in the same orbit when no damage was detected atlantis landed successfully on september 21.  the columbia crew survival investigation report released by nasa on december 30, 2008, made further recommendations to improve a crews survival chances on future space vehicles such as the orion spacecraft these included improvements in crew restraints finding ways to deal more effectively with catastrophic cabin depressurization more degradation of vehicles during a disaster so that crews will have a better chance at survival and automated parachute systems.59  sociocultural aftermathedit  fears of terrorismedit  after the shuttles breakup there were some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved but no evidence of that has ever surfaced.87 security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first israeli astronaut.88 the merritt island launch facility like all sensitive government areas had increased security after the september 11 attacks  purple streak imageedit  the san francisco chronicle reported that an amateur astronomer had taken a five-second exposure that appeared to show purplish line near the shuttle resembling lightning during re-entry.89 the caib report concluded that the image was the result of vibrations during a long-exposure.90  2003 armageddon film hoaxedit  in response to the disaster fx canceled its scheduled airing two nights later of the 1998 film armageddon in which the space shuttle atlantis is depicted as being destroyed by asteroid fragments.91 in a hoax inspired by the destruction of columbia some images that were purported to be satellite photographs of the shuttles turned out to be screen captures from the space shuttle destruction scene of armageddon  musicedit  the 2003 album bananas by deep purple includes lost an instrumental piece written by guitarist steve morse in remembrance of the loss morse is donating his songwriting royalties to the families of the astronauts.92  catherine faber and callie hills folk group known as echos children included a memorial song titled columbia on their 2004 album from the hazel tree  the 2005 album ultimatum ep by the long winters contains the song commander thinks aloud which was songwritersinger john rodericks musing on the crews perspective of the unexpected catastrophe.94 in addition the january 30, 2015 episode of hrishikesh hirways song exploder podcast presented an interview with john roderick about the songwriting and recording process for commander thinks Aloud.95  swiss post-rock band the evpatoria report used the records of radio communication between columbia and capcom as a sample for their instrumental song taijin kyofusho on their 2005 album golevka  the hungarian composer peter etvs wrote a piece named seven for solo violin and orchestra in 2006 in memory of the crew of columbia seven was premiered in 2007 by violinist akiko suwanai conducted by pierre boulez and it was recorded in 2012 with violinist patricia kopatchinskaja and the composer conducting.96  the 2008 album columbia we dare to dream by anne cabrera was written as a tribute to space shuttle columbia STS-107, the crew support teams recovery teams and the crews families.97 a copy of the album on compact disc was flown aboard space shuttle discovery mission STS-131 to the international space station by astronaut clayton anderson in april 2010.98  the scottish folk-rock band runrig included a song entitled on their album the story the song was dedicated to laurel clark had become a fan of the band during her navy service in scotland and includes a piece of her wake up song followed by some radio chatter at the end.99  see alsoedit  united states portal  spaceflight portal  texas portal  2000s portal  apollo 1  criticism of the
