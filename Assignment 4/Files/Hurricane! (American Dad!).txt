with making terrible decisions during crisis situations but before the debate can be resolved the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street removing buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the smiths in their home nevertheless the neighborhood is now flooded and while the smiths thinks its too late to escape the house is drifting along the floodwaters current in an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas stan anchors the home however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down partially submerging it underwater  roger cries when his girlfriend falls to the floor and gets impaled by a sharp object later the attic starts to fill it with water hayley tries to get the door shut but its too strong to close off klaus now having the home being flooded can go whenever he wants and says see you never with the f-word being bombed he jumps out of the fishbowl into the water only to have his skin to burn

until its here picks up the wigs instead klaus that he still go to cowboy weddings leaving him behind franice tell the family to take one at the time as the rope is too weak unfortunately jeff was too

speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work
