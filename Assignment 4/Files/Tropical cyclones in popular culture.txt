fiction and literatureedit  although many forms of natural disaster appear in fiction and literature tropical cyclones serve a number of useful literary functions because they are both extraordinarily powerful and to those who have some experience with them their occurrence can be portended several days in advance the noaa page notes that  there is undeniable drama to hurricanes their massive scale affecting the lives of thousands the foreshadowing of impending doom and their ponderous pace as they approach the shore this has made them ideal plot elements in many fictional works.1  the strength

norway it is unlikely that the event described could have fallen within the formal definition of a hurricane as such storms form almost exclusively in the maritime tropical air masses of tropical regions of the globe  joseph conrad in his acclaimed 1903 book typhoon uses a tropical cyclone as a more direct element of the story centering the plot on a ship captains stubborn insistence on going
