atlantic hurricane season  tropical storm marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record the thirteenth named storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern caribbean during late september 2008. influenced by a tropical wave on October4, a small low-level circulation center developed over belize after crossing the southern end of the yucatn peninsula and emerging into the bay of campeche the low was declared tropical depression thirteen early on October6. the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name marco later that day marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65mph early on October7. around this time tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles from the center of the storm making marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record.12 around 1200UTC, marco made landfall near misantla veracruz the storm rapidly weakened after landfall dissipating later that day due to its small size marco caused minimal damage however the storms heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet deep that covered highways and damaged homes  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations impact and

in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern caribbean in late september 2008. on October4, a tropical wave reached the same area and the system spawned a circulation center over belize development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land as the system neared the bay of campeche convection quickly developed around the low at 0000UTC on October6, the low was designated as tropical depression thirteen while located over laguna de Trminos.2 a mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west-northwest direction forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storms well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path.3 by 1200UTC, the small cyclone with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles kilometers across was upgraded to tropical storm Marco.2  favorable conditions for development allowed marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on October6. early on October7, marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65mph and a minimum pressure of 998millibar 29.47inHg.2 this was based on a reconnaissance mission into marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70mph corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61mph following the quick increase in intensity forecasters noted the possibility of marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall.4 the storm maintained a small area of deep convection averaging 9.2 miles in diameter as it continued moving towards the west-northwest.5 shortly after reaching peak intensity tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles from the center of Marco.6 at 1200UTC, the center of marco made landfall near misantla veracruz with winds of 65mph once inland marco rapidly weakened,7 being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall the small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of Mexico.2  preparations impact and recordsedit  see also tropical

warning for the gulf of mexico from tuxpan to punta el Lagarto.8 that afternoon the government issued a hurricane watch between cabo rojo and veracruz and extended the tropical storm warning northward to cabo Rojo.9 officials closed schools ahead of the storm and opened 200 shelters.10 an estimated 3,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the coast.11 soldiers used school buses to transport evacuees to the shelters.10 marco formed in the area of mexicos main oil-facilities,12 leading to the evacuation of 33 workers from four platforms six oil wells and a natural gas processing plant were also shut down in Veracruz.10 the mexican secretariat of communications and transportation also closed the ports of nautla and alvarado to small vessels as a precautionary measure.13  marco shortly after being upgraded to a tropical storm on October6  upon landfall heavy rains peaking at 7.9 inches millimeters in el pujal san luis Potos14 and falling at rates up to 1inch per hour caused some flooding in coastal towns near veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground.15 the rains from marco worsened flood situations in areas of mexico already suffering from severe flooding.10 officials in veracruz in their post-storm damage survey reported that two rivers the quilate and tenoch overflowed their banks due to rains produced by Marco.16 one of these rivers left the towns of minatitlan and hidalgotitlan under 10ft of water.10 highways along the coast of veracruz were also flooded.17 another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks.18 thirteen municipalities within veracruz were affected by marco in vega de alatorre 77 people were evacuated to nearby shelters after their homes were inundated with water three landslides were also reported in misantla colipa none of them caused damage.19 in all marcos impact was light minimal damage was recorded and none of the estimated 400,000 people affected by the storm sustained injury.220  in the
