a blizzard as a severe snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities the difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind not the amount of snow to be a blizzard a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to 56kmh with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400m or 0.25mi or less and must last for a prolonged period of timetypically three hours or more.12  while severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may accompany blizzards they are not required blizzards can bring whiteout conditions and can paralyze regions for days at a time particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare  a severe blizzard has winds over 72kmh near zero visibility and temperatures of 12C or lower.3 in antarctica blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 160kmh  ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds the primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface  drifted snow near burrow-with-burrow lancashire england january 1963  the australia bureau of meteorology describes a blizzard as and very cold wind which is laden with snow some part at least of which has been raised from snow covered ground  the oxford english dictionary concludes the term blizzard is likely onomatopoeic derived from the same sense as blow blast blister and bluster the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829, when it was defined as a blow it achieved its modern definition by 1859, when it was in use in the western united states the term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 188081.5  united states storm systemsedit  duluth minnesota blizzard march 2007  march blizzard in north dakota 1966.  in the united states storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south allowing cold dry polar air from the north to clash with warm humid air moving up from the south.26 they are most common in the great plains the great lakes states and the northeastern states along the coast and less common in the pacific northwest  when cold moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward to the rocky mountains and the great plains and warmer moist air moves north from the gulf of mexico all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the texas panhandle to the great lakes  another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the hudson bay area in canada is displaced southward over southeastern canada the great lakes and new england when the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the gulf of mexico strong surface winds significant cold air advection and extensive wintry precipitation occur  conditions approaching a blizzard whiteout in minnesota on

of 1888  a noreaster is a macro-scale storm along the upper east coast of the united states and atlantic canada it gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from the usage of the term in north america comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the north atlantic ocean and some of which form as far south as the gulf of mexico the term is most often used in the coastal areas of new england and atlantic canada this type of storm has characteristics similar to a hurricane more specifically it describes a low-pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the east coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast high storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion notable noreasters include the great blizzard of 1888, one of the worst blizzards in us history it dropped 100130cm of snow and had sustained winds of more than 45 miles per hour that

railway stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable the near-starvation of the townspeople and the courage of her future husband almanzo and another man who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed  the october blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows no one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested their grain milled or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place by january the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort as soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line a new storm arrived filling up the line and leaving their work useless  there were no winter thaws and on february 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days in the towns the streets were filled with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was needed to secure passage about town homes and barns were
