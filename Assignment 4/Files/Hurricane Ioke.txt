referred to as typhoon ioke was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the central pacific the first storm to form in the central pacific in the 2006 pacific hurricane season ioke was a record breaking long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the pacific for 17days, reaching the equivalent of category 5 status on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale on three different occasions  the cyclone developed in the intertropical convergence zone on august 20 far to the south of hawaii encountering warm waters little wind shear and well-defined outflow ioke intensified from a tropical depression to category 4 status within 48hours. late on august 22 it rapidly weakened to Category2 status before crossing over johnston atoll two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening and ioke attained Category5 status on august 25 before crossing the international date line as it continued westward its intensity fluctuated and on august 31 it passed near wake island with winds of 155mph ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward and by september 6 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into alaska  ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the central pacific or western pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon a crew of 12people rode out the hurricane in a hurricane-proof bunker on johnston atoll the crew estimated winds reached over 100mph which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the islands bird population the typhoon left moderate damage on wake island totaling equivalent to in 2016, including blown off roofs and damaged buildings though the infrastructure of the island was left intact all military personnel were evacuated from the island later the extratropical remnants of ioke produced a severe storm surge along the alaskan coastline causing beach erosion  contents  1 meteorological history  2

track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the intertropical convergence zone spawned a tropical disturbance with a low-level circulation far to the southeast of hawaii in the middle of august 2006. under the influence of a strong westward-moving subtropical ridge to its north the disturbance tracked nearly due westward with deep convection in the region increasing and decreasing on a daily basis it slowly became better organized and early on august 20 the disturbance developed into tropical depression one-c while located about 775mi south of honolulu hawaii at the time there was no convection associated with the itcz within 10Longitude.1 with wind shear practically non-existent and sea surface temperatures of around 82F conditions favored strengthening,1 and operationally the cyclone was forecast to reach minimal hurricane status within four days before beginning to weaken.2 the depression attained tropical storm status within six hours of developing.1 the central pacific hurricane center designated the system with the name ioke hawaiian for the name Joyce.3 subsequently ioke quickly strengthened and by late on august 20 the storm developed a central dense overcast and the beginnings of an eyewall4 early on august 21 the storm intensified into a hurricane just 24hours after first developing.1  hurricane ioke steadily deepened as it continued west-northwestward with better definition of the eye and deepening of the eyewall convection.5 near the international date line a frontal trough turned the hurricane to the northwest and after a period of rapid deepening ioke attained winds of 135mph early on august 22 while located about 280mi southeast of johnston atoll after maintaining Category4 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale for about 18hours,1 southwesterly wind shear slightly disrupted the inner core of the hurricane,6 and ioke quickly weakened to winds of about 105mph late on august 22, the hurricane passed about 30mi south of johnston Atoll,1 with the northeastern portion of the eyewall crossing the atoll early on august 23.7 after turning westward later in the day wind shear began to decrease allowing a second period of rapid deepening by august 24 the hurricane maintained a 23mi closed eyewall,8 and on august 25 ioke attained category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale while located about 970mi west-southwest of the hawaiian island of Kauai.1  typhoon ioke gaining strength after crossing the international date line on august 28  after maintaining Category5 status for about 18hours,1 hurricane ioke weakened slightly due to an eyewall replacement cycle.9 completing the cycle on august 26,10 the hurricane restrengthened to Category5 status the trough to its west tracked further away from the hurricane allowing the subtropical ridge to build ahead of the hurricane which turned ioke to the southwest.1 the overall environment remained very favorable for sustainment of the powerful cyclone strong upper-level cyclones far to its northwest provided outflow channels and light wind shear with warm water temperatures along its path.10 with the conditions the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory hurricane model predicted ioke to reach winds of 220mph with a predicted minimum pressure of 860mbar early on august 27, the pressure dropped to 915mbar and shortly thereafter ioke crossed the international date line becoming a 160mph typhoon.1  unofficially referred as a super typhoon by the joint typhoon warning center ioke remained at the equivalence of a Category5 hurricane for about 12hours after crossing the date line it then began a slight weakening trend on august 28,12 due to increased inflow from the ridge to its north.13 on august 29, the cyclone turned to the west and west-northwest while tracking around the periphery of the subtropical ridge and ioke again reached the equivalence of Category5 status.12 the japan meteorological agency assessed ioke as attaining peak 10minute sustained winds of 120mph on august 30.14 later that day the typhoon weakened to the equivalent of a Category4 hurricane for the final time and on august 31 ioke passed very near wake island with winds of about 155mph  by september 1, increased wind shear and drier air caused the eye of ioke to become cloud-filled and elongated,15 and by september 2 ioke was undergoing another eyewall replacement cycle.16 on september 2, ioke passed about 50mi north of minami-tori-shima with winds of about 125mph gradual weakening continued and the typhoon steadily shifted its track to the northwest around the subtropical ridge a deepening trough turned ioke to the north-northwest and north,18 and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm a few hundred miles east of japan after accelerating northeastward the cyclone began losing tropical characteristics and the jtwc declared ioke as an extratropical cyclone on september 5.12 the jma maintained ioke as a typhoon until a day later and maintained ioke as a tropical cyclone until it was declared extratropical midday on september 6. the extratropical remnants of ioke were tracked by the jma until september 7, when it was located near the aleutian islands of Alaska.14 the storm deepened as it approached the aleutians and re-developed winds of hurricane-force the storm entered the bering sea on september 8, and after turning eastward crossed the aleutian islands and entered the gulf of alaska the extratropical remnants of ioke dissipated near southeastern alaska on september 12.19  preparations and impactedit  typhoon ioke after going over wake island  johnston atolledit  late on august 21, about 24hours prior to its closest approach the central pacific hurricane center issued a hurricane warning for uninhabited territory of johnston Island,20 due to the uncertainty of whether anyone was on the island.21 a united states air force vessel and a 12person crew were on the island and after securing their ship the crew took shelter in a hurricane-proof concrete bunker.122 there were no meteorological observations on the island but the crew estimated tropical storm force winds lasted for about 27hours with hurricane-force winds lasting six to eight hours peak wind gusts were estimated at 110 to 130mph to 210kmh. the crew sustained no injuries and their ship received only minor damage hurricane ioke with a portion of its eye crossing the atoll left an estimated 15 of the palm trees on the island with their tops blown off with some ironwood trees blown over the island bird population was unaffected the hurricane produced rough surf which washed away a portion of a sea wall and an adjacent road.1  wake islandedit  typhoon ioke near wake island on august 31  under the threat of the typhoon for several days two C-17 globemaster iii airlifters evacuated between 188200 military personnel from wake island to hawaii the first full-scale evacuation of the island since typhoon sarah in 1967.2324 a buoy just east of the island recorded a pressure of 921.5 millibars as ioke crossed directly over it.25 before the typhoon passed just north of the island an anemometer recorded hurricane-force winds with a peak wind gust of 100mph before the instrument stopped reporting.26 sustained winds were estimated to have reached 155mph with gusts to 190mph the minimum central pressure recorded on the island was 934mbar at 0906UTC on august 31.26 the typhoon was expected to produce a storm surge of 18ft and wave heights of 40ft along wake island where the highest point is 20ft additionally heavy rainfall from the typhoon left buildings flooded with 2ft of standing water found several days after its passage.28  the powerful winds of typhoon ioke caused extensive damage to the islands power grid leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged the combination of the winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70 of the buildings in the territory many of which with moderate roof damage all low-lying areas were described as being covered with sea water or sand and the territory was left without running water.28 communications were downed on the island with satellite dishes and cables destroyed.29 damage to the infrastructure was extensive though repairable and less than expected.30 damage on the island was estimated at  japan and alaskaedit  the extratropical remnants of ioke over the bering sea west of alaska on september 7  on september 1, the japan meteorological agency ordered the temporary evacuation of its staff on minami-tori-shima under threat of the typhoon the agency expected high waves and winds on the island.32 facilities on the island were damaged although it was repaired and fully operational within three weeks after the storm.33  the extratropical remnant of ioke produced a storm surge and high surf in excess of 30ft along the southwestern coastline of alaska which coincided with the astronomical high tide the combination led to minor flooding along bristol bay and yukon-kuskokwim Delta.34 wind gusts peaked at 84mph in Unalaska.35 the system produced moderate to heavy rainfall across the western portion of alaska including daily rainfall records of 1.15inches at bethel and 0.67in at kotzebue rainfall continued into the southeastern portion of the state contributing to above-normal rainfall totals near Juneau.36  records and aftermathedit  damage on wake island after ioke  hurricane ioke became one of five hurricanes to reach category 5 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale in the central north pacific ocean and the only one originating in the basin with an estimated minimum central pressure of 915mbar the cyclone attained the lowest estimated surface pressure for any hurricane within the basin,1 surpassing the previous minimum set by hurricane gilma in 1994.37 ioke maintained at least Category4 status for 198consecutive hours which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone anywhere on Earth.1 additionally the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a super typhoon for 174consecutive hours which was also a record.25 as a result of its extended duration and intensity hurricanetyphoon ioke accrued an accumulated cyclone energy index of 82, which set a new worldwide record.38  the united states coast guard first performed an aerial assessment of damage on wake island on september 2, three days after the typhoon struck the flight indicated an overall damage smaller than expected and reported a lack of oil spill or hazardous material leak the us coast guard arrived by boat with a team on september 7, with a preliminary damage assessment completed four days later the team repaired a generator to provide power.28 the united states navys combat stores ship the usns san jose and sixteen members united states air forces 36th contingency response group at andersen afb guam arrived on september 8 and analyzed the stability of the airfield along with assisting in clean-up efforts and after core tests workers cleared the runway to allow flights onto the territory.39 on september 13, a group of engineers restored power on the island.40 about two weeks after the cyclone several buildings were operational.30  the central pacific hurricane center requested the retirement of the name and in april 2007, the name ioke was retired and replaced with Iopa.41  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  2006 pacific hurricane season  2006 pacific typhoon season  list of category 5
