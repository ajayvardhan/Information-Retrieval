an upper level low to its west the weak storm moved northwestward and made landfall on southeastern texas grace quickly weakened over land and dissipated on september 2 as it merged into a cold front  in texas the storm dropped heavy rainfall causing minor flash flooding damage the cold front combined with the remnants of the storm dropped moderate to heavy rainfall from texas through the

storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a strong tropical wave accompanied with a low pressure system moved off the coast of africa on august 19. it moved quickly westward and organized developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection the wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on august 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection the wave entered an area of dry air in the central atlantic ocean and by late on august 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system on august 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the lesser antilles though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development the tropical wave moved through the caribbean sea and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the gulf of honduras on august 28. the wave crossed the yucatn peninsula and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the gulf of mexico convection continued to organize and the tropical wave developed into tropical depression eleven on august 30 while located 335miles east-southeast of corpus christi Texas.1  the depression moved to the northwest and intensified into tropical storm grace six hours after forming despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad with reconnaissance aircraft having difficulty pinpointing the center in addition an upper level low located over brownsville texas produced shear over the western portion of the system which limited outflow to the east side forecasters predicted the upper level low to weaken allowing for the possibility of grace to intensify to a 65mph tropical storm over warm waters.2 however the upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system a new center of circulation reformed 115miles north of the original center and made landfall near san luis pass on the southwestern portion of galveston island on august 31 as a minimal tropical storm grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land and after turning northeastward into oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front.1  preparationsedit  three hours after forming officials issued tropical storm warnings from high island to corpus christi Texas.1 local national weather service offices requested a voluntary evacuation for western galveston island including jamaica beach the bolivar peninsula and coastal areas of brazoria and matagorda counties,3 though few residents heeded the warnings local emergency management officials predicted tides of up to 5feet above normal with coastal flooding.4  impactedit  rainfall totals for grace  grace produced moderate amounts of rainfall along its path peaking in southern texas the storm later merged with a cold front which later dropped heavy rainfall in the mid-west united states in addition to its impact on the united states the outer rainbands of grace caused light rainfall in yucatn and northern Tamaulipas.5  south-central united statesedit  upon making landfall tropical storm grace produced a light storm surge of 3.5feet in matagorda and north jetty texas wind gusts peaked at 53mph with sustained winds of 40mph at sea rim state park locations closer to where the storm made landfall reported below tropical storm force winds with the exception of galveston which recorded a 40mph wind gust.1 rainfall was moderate to heavy across eastern texas peaking at 10.36inches in spindletop Bayou.6 the outer bands of grace spawned a waterspout just south of the western tip of galveston island prompting the issuance of a tornado warning the waterspout dissipated before moving onshore the storm also caused light beach erosion though little occurred beyond the erosion caused by hurricane claudette one month prior.3 near the coast high tides from the storm flooded piers bulkheads and low-lying areas.4 further inland heavy rainfall lead to flash flooding covering roads and entering a few houses overall damage was minor and totaled to 2016USD.78  in oklahoma moisture from the storm combined with a slow-moving cold front produced heavy rainfall across the state peaking at 8.98inches in courtney due to below normal precipitation by as much as 5 to 10inches to 255mm, flooding was localized and overall minimal near medford the rainfall lead to 2feet deep flooding on us highway 81, forcing its closure the rainfall was welcome in the state and lessened the rainfall deficit.9  tropical storm grace combined with the slow-moving cold front produced light to moderate rainfall totals across the southern united states including isolated locations in louisiana and mississippi reporting over 3inches and over 5inches in northeastern Arkansas.6  ohio valley and eastern united statesedit  in missouri the cold front combined with moisture from the remnants of grace brought temporary relief to a severe drought10 by producing light to moderate rainfall of up to 5inches in the southeastern portion of the state.6 in poplar bluff the rainfall caused severe flooding resulting in rescues for people in trapped vehicles.11 the moisture produced over 5inches in northern kentucky as well.6  moisture from the remnants of grace dropped heavy rainfall across central indiana including a record one-day total of 7inches in indianapolis while other locations received over 9inches residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes the rapid rainfall in indianapolis backed up the sewage system sending hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage into the streets following the deluge in the state the governor declared a state of emergency for the state eight local american red cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.12  the remnants of grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall eastward through the mid-atlantic states and new england locations in extreme western maryland and southeastern virginia received over 5inches of rain.6 in maryland hagerstown recorded 3.94inches resulting in flash flooding in washington county the system produced 1.09inches of rain a new daily record damage in maryland if any was unknown.13  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  tropical storm grace  timeline of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season
