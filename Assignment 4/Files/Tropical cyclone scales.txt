tropical cyclone intensity scales according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basins they are located in only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones but some alternative scales also exist such as accumulated cyclone energy the power dissipation index the integrated kinetic energy index and the hurricane severity index  tropical cyclones that develop in the northern hemisphere are officially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the north atlantic ocean or the north-eastern pacific ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms should a system intensify further and become a hurricane then it will be classified on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period in the western pacific the typhoon committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period  the india meteorological departments scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins the scale used to classify systems in the south-west indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france for use in various french territories including new caledonia and french polynesia  the definition of sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10m however the saffirsimpson hurricane scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period at 10m above the surface the scale used by rsmc new delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period and the australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval these make direct comparisons between basins difficult  within all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds hit 35kn 65kmh.  contents  1 background  2 atlantic eastern and

when to remove this template message  tropical cyclones are defined as being warm cored non-frontal synoptic cyclones that develop over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked by the world meteorological organisations regional specialized meteorological centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in with for example the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere all of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds

tropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere to the east of the anti-meridian are officially monitored by either the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane Center.1 within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored non-frontal synoptic disturbance that develops over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre.1 the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones.1 once either of these classifications are met then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn 62kmh.1 however if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone.1 should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 3463kn 63118kmh, then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name.1  should the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured as greater than 64kn 119kmh, then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale.1 the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1 hurricane which has winds of between 6482kn 119153kmh.12 should the hurricane intensify further then it will be rated as a category 2 hurricane if it has winds of between 8395kn 154177kmh.12 when a system becomes a category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96112kn 178208kmh, it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning centers.2 a category 4 hurricane has winds of 113136kn 209251kmh, while a category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn 252kmh.12 a post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage.1 however advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone poses a significant threat to life and property.1 they may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours.1  the sshs was originally created using both wind speed and storm surge but since the relationship between wind speed and storm surge is not necessarily definite the scale was changed to the hurricane wind scale based entirely on wind speed  although increasing echelons of the scale correspond to stronger winds the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms depending on factors such as local terrain population density and total rainfall for instance a Category2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large Category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region in fact tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties especially from flooding and landslides  historically the term great hurricane was used to describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110kn 200kmh, large radii 160km 100mi and that caused large amounts of destruction this term fell into disuse after the introduction of the saffirsimpson scale in the early 1970s.3  a minor change to the scale was made ahead of the 2012 hurricane season with the wind speeds for categories 35 tweaked to eliminate the rounding errors that had occurred during previous seasons when a hurricane had wind speeds of 115kn 215kmh.4  western pacificedit  rsmc tokyos tropicalcycloneintensityscale  category  sustained winds  violent typhoon  105knots  194kmh  verystrong typhoon  85104knots  157193kmh  typhoon  6484knots

over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation.5 the lowest classification used by the typhoon committee is a tropical depression which has 10-minute sustained winds of less than 33kn 38mph 61kmh.5 should the tropical depression intensify further it is named and classified as a tropical storm which has winds speeds between 3347kn 3854mph 6187kmh.5 should the system continue to intensify further then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm which has winds speeds between 4863kn 5572mph 89117kmh.5 the highest classification on the typhoon committees scale is a typhoon which has winds speeds greater than 64kn 74mph 119kmh.5  the china meteorological administration the hong kong observatory pagasa and the jma all divide the typhoon category further for domestic purposes.5 the jma divides the typhoon category into three categories with a 10-minute maximum wind speed below 84kn 97mph 156kmh assigned for the typhoon category a very strong typhoon has wind speeds between 85104kn 98120mph 157193kmh, while a violent typhoon has wind speeds of 105kn 121mph 194kmh or greater.5 the hko and the cma also divide the typhoon category into three categories with both assigning a maximum wind speed of 80kn 92mph 150kmh to the typhoon category a severe typhoon has wind speeds of 85104kn 98120mph 157193kmh, while a super typhoon has winds of 100kn 120mph 190kmh.56 during may 2015 pagasa introduced the term super typhoon and used it for systems with winds greater than 120kn 140mph 220kmh.7  in addition to the national meteorological services of each nation the united states joint typhoon warning center monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the united states Government.8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however the jtwc uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin.9 these classifications are tropical depression tropical storm typhoon and super Typhoon.9 in addition the taiwan central weather bureau has its own scale in chinese but uses the typhoon committee scale in English.10  north indian oceanedit  india meteorological department  tropical cyclone intensity scale  category  sustained winds  average  super cyclonic storm  120kt  221kmh

within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation.11 the lowest official classification used in the north indian ocean is a depression which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 1727kn 3149kmh.11 should the depression intensify further then it will become a deep depression which has winds between 2833kn 5061kmh.11 the system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the imd if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 3447kn 6288kmh.11 severe cyclonic storms have storm force wind speeds of between 4863kn 89117kmh, while very severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force winds of 6489kt 118166kmh. extremely severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force winds of 90119kn 104137mph.11 the highest classification used in the north indian ocean is a super cyclonic storm which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn 222kmh.11  historically a system has been classified as a depression if it is an area where the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings.12 other classifications historically used include cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10 on the beaufort scale and a cyclone where the winds are either force 11 and 12 on the beaufort scale.12 between 1924 and 1988, tropical cyclones were classified into four categories depression deep depression cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms.12 however a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds for tropical cyclones with wind speeds of more than 64kn 119kmh.12 during 1999 the categories very severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm were introduced while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated.12 during 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90119kn 104137mph an extremely severe cyclonic storm.13 the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states Government.8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones.9  south-western indian oceanedit  southwest indian ocean

synoptic scale low pressure area originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation with the average wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots  a tropical disturbance is mfrs generic term for a non-frontal area of low pressure that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation.14 the system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28knots 32mph.14  a system is designated as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28knots 32mph. should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35knots 40mph then it will be classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the sub regional center in mauritius or madagascar no matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin it is always designated as a subtropical depression.15  should the named storm intensify further and reach winds speeds of 48knots 55mph, then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm.15 a severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64knots 74mph.14 should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90knots 103mph, it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone.14 a very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the south-west indian ocean tropical cyclone scale and has winds of over 115knots 132mph.15  at the tenth ra i tropical cyclone committee held during 1991, it was recommended that the intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 199394 tropical cyclone season.16 specifically it was decided that the classifications weak tropical depression moderate tropical depression and severe tropical depression would be changed to tropical depression moderate tropical storm and severe tropical Storm.16 this change was implemented ahead of the 199394 tropical cyclone season.16 the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states Government.8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson

are run by the fiji meteorological service new zealands metservice indonesias badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika papua new guineas national weather service while three others are run by the australian bureau of Meteorology.17 within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non-frontal low pressure system of synoptic scale that develops over warm waters with a definite organized wind circulation and 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34kn 39mph or greater near the centre.17 once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute maximum sustained winds.1718 a category 1 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 3447kn 6387kmh, while a category 2 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 4863kn 89117kmh.1819 when a system becomes a category 3 tropical cyclone it is reclassified as a severe tropical cyclone and has wind speeds of 6485kn 119157kmh.1819 a category 4 severe tropical cyclone has winds of 86110 kn 157200kmh, while the maximum rating is a category 5 severe tropical cyclone which has winds of at least 110kn 200kmh.1819  for systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used including tropical disturbance tropical low and tropical Depression.17 a tropical disturbance is defined as being a non frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics with persistent enhanced convection andor some indication of a circulation.17 a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation where the central position can be estimated and the maximum 10-minute average wind speed is less than 34kn 63kmh near the centre.17 the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24 hours.17 the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom ahead of the 198990 cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states Government.8 these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones.9  alternative scalesedit  there are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres however they are used by other organizations such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potential.20  accumulated cyclone energy is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons.21 it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm speed 35 knots or higher at six-hour intervals.21 the numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed.21 as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the power dissipation index  the hurricane severity index is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields.23 the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclones intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size.23 points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.23  comparisons across basinsedit  the terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another below is a summary of the classifications used by the official
