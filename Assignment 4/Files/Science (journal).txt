one year later and had some success while covering the meetings of prominent american scientific societies including the AAAS.7 however by 1894, science was again in financial difficulty and was sold to psychologist james mckeen cattell for  in an agreement worked out by cattell and aaas secretary leland o howard science became the journal of the american association for the advancement of science

spiral nebulae by edwin Hubble.9 after cattell died in 1944, the ownership of the journal was transferred to the AAAS.10  after cattells death in 1944, the journal lacked a consistent editorial presence until graham dushane became editor in 1956. in 1958, under dushanes leadership science absorbed the scientific monthly thus increasing the journals circulation by over 60 from 38,000 to more

until 1995. from 1995 until 2000, neuroscientist floyd e bloom held that position.12 biologist donald kennedy became the editor of science in 2000. biochemist bruce alberts took his place in march
