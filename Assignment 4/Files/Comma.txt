in many typefaces but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text some typefaces render it as a small line slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical or with the appearance of a small filled-in figure 9.  the comma is used in many contexts and languages mainly for separating parts of a sentence such as clauses and items in lists particularly when there are three or more items listed the word comma comes from the greek which originally meant a cut-off piece specifically in grammar a short clause.12  a comma-shaped mark is used as a diacritic in several writing systems and is considered distinct from the cedilla the rough and smooth breathings appear above the letter in ancient greek and the comma diacritic appears below the letter in latvian

invented a system of single dots that separated verses and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of text when reading aloud.3 the different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom middle or top of the line for a short passage komma a media distinctio dot was placed mid-level this is the origin of the concept of a comma although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated  the mark used today is descended from a diagonal slash or virgula suspensiva used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause the modern comma was first used by aldus Manutius.45  uses in englishedit  in general the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked grammatically to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise the comma performs a number of functions in english writing it is used in generally similar ways in other languages particularly european ones although the rules on comma usage and their rigidity vary from language to language  in listsedit  commas are placed between items in lists as in they own a cat a dog two rabbits and seven mice some english style guides recommend that a comma be used before the final conjunction or nor in a list of more than two elements a comma used in such a position is variously called a serial comma an oxford comma or a harvard comma the oxford university press and harvard university press both prominent advocates of this style such use of a comma sometimes prevents ambiguity  the sentence i spoke to the boys sam and tom could mean either i spoke to the boys and sam and tom spoke to more than three people or i spoke to the boys who are sam and tom spoke to two people  i spoke to the boys sam and tom must be the boys and sam and tom spoke to more than three people  the serial comma does not eliminate all confusion consider the following sentence  i thank my mother anne smith and thomas this could mean either my mother and anne smith and thomas people or my mother who is anne smith and thomas people this sentence might be recast as mother smith and thomas for clarity  i thank my mother anne smith and thomas because the comma after is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an apposite phrase that is a renaming of or further information about a noun this construction suggests that my mothers name is smith and thomas compare thank my friend smith and wesson in which the ambiguity is obvious  as a rule of thumb the guardian style Guide6 suggests that straightforward lists ate ham eggs and chips do not need a comma before the final but sometimes it can help the reader ate cereal kippers bacon eggs toast and marmalade and tea the chicago manual of style and other academic writing guides require the serial comma all lists must have a comma before the prefacing the last item in a series  if the individual items of a list are long complex affixed with description or themselves contain commas semicolons may be preferred as separators and the list may be introduced with a colon  in news headlines a comma might replace the word even if there are only two items in order to save space as in this headline from Reuters7  trump macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy  separation of clausesedit  commas are often used to separate clauses in english a comma is used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first after i fed the cat i brushed my clothes this with i brushed my clothes after i fed the cat a relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive as in i cut down all the trees which were over six feet tall the comma this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down  some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction and nor but or yet so must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.89 in the following sentences where the second clause is independent it can stand alone as a sentence the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary  mary walked to the party but she was unable to walk home  designer clothes are silly and i cant afford them anyway  dont push that button or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet  in the following sentences where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause it does not contain an explicit subject those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted  mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home  i think designer clothes are silly and cant afford them anyway  however such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short typically when the second independent clause is an imperative,89 as in  sit down and shut up  the above guidance is not universally accepted or applied long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas10  she had very little to live on but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers  in some languages such as german and polish stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses with dependent clauses always being set off with commas and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions  the joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction in is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark is known as a comma splice and is sometimes considered an error in English11 in most cases a semicolon should be used instead a comma splice should not be confused though with asyndeton a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted  certain adverbsedit  commas are always used to set off certain adverbs at the beginning of a sentence including however in fact therefore nevertheless moreover furthermore and still  therefore a comma would be appropriate in this sentence  nevertheless i will not use one  if these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence they are followed and preceded by a comma as in the second of the two below examples if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma  in this sentence furthermore commas would also be called for  this sentence is similar however a semicolon is necessary as well  using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional including then so yet instead and too also  so thats it for this rule or  so thats it for this rule  a comma would be appropriate in this sentence too or  a comma would be appropriate in this sentence too  parenthetical phrasesedit  commas are often used to enclose parenthetical words and phrases within a sentence information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence the following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases  introductory phrase once upon a time my father ate a muffin.12  interjection my father ate the muffin gosh darn it  aside my father if you dont mind me telling you this ate the muffin  appositive my father a jaded and bitter man ate the muffin  absolute phrase my father his eyes flashing with rage ate the muffin  free modifier my father chewing with unbridled fury ate the muffin  resumptive modifier my father ate the muffin a muffin which no man had yet chewed  summative modifier my father ate the muffin a feat which no man had attempted  between adjectivesedit  a comma is used to separate coordinate adjectives adjectives that directly and equally modify the following noun adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if and were placed between them for example  the dull incessant droning but the cute little cottage  the devious lazy red frog suggests there are lazy red frogs of which is devious while the devious lazy red frog does not carry this connotation  before quotationsedit  some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma as in mr kershner says should know how to use a comma quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a colon rather than a comma  other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway thus they would write mr kershner says should know how to use a comma  in datesedit  month day yearedit  when a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year a comma separates the day from the year december 19, 1941. this style is common in american english the comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers december 191941. most style manuals including the chicago manual of Style13 and the ap Stylebook,14 also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after it 14, 1987, was the target date  if just month and year are given no commas are used15 daughter april may return in june 2009 for the reunion  day month yearedit  when the day precedes the month the month name separates the numeric day and year so commas are not necessary to separate them raid on alexandria was carried out on 19December1941.  in geographical namesedit  commas are used to separate parts of geographical references such as city and state texas or city and country uganda additionally most style manuals including the chicago manual of Style16 and the ap Stylebook,17 recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after plane landed in kampala uganda that evening.18  the united states postal Service19 and royal Mail20 recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages as the marks hinder optical character recognition  in numbersedit  main article decimal mark  in representing large numbers from the right side to the left english texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal this is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself however in much of europe southern africa and latin america periods or spaces are used instead the comma is used as a decimal separator equivalent to the use in english of the decimal point in india the groups are two digits except for the rightmost group however the comma may not be used for this purpose at all in some styles eg the si writing style21 a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead  in namesedit  commas are used when writing names that are presented surname first generally in instances of alphabetization by surname smith john they are also used before many titles that follow a name john smith phd  big final rule for the comma is one that you wont find in any books by grammarians dont use commas like a stupid person  lynne truss eats shoots and Leaves.22  similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion socks green 3 pairs socks red 2 pairs tie regimental 1.  ellipsisedit  commas may be used to indicate that a word or a group of words has been omitted,23 as in the cat was white the dog brown the comma replaces was  vocativeedit  commas are placed before after or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person place or thing  i hope john that you will read this  between the subject and predicateedit  in his 1785 essay on punctuation joseph robertson advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity however this usage is regarded as an error in modern times  the good taste of the present age has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the english language  whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit is an enemy to society  differences between american and british usageedit  the comma and the quotation mark pairing can be used in several ways in american english the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark2425  my mother gave me the nickname bobby bob bob boy which really made me angry  in great britain and many other parts of the world punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to242526  my mother gave me the nickname bobby bob bob boy which really made me angry  there is also some difference regarding the use of the serial comma which is an optional comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items  they served apples peaches and bananas comma used  we cleaned up cores pits and skins comma omitted  the serial comma is also known as the oxford comma harvard comma or series comma it is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an americanismcitation needed but its usage occurs within both american and british english it is called the oxford comma because of its long history of use by oxford university Press.27  opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma a majority of american style guides mandate use of the serial comma including the chicago manual of style strunk and whites the elements of style and the us government printing office style manual the ap stylebook for journalistic writing advises against it it is used less often in british english but some british style guides require it including the oxford university press style manual and fowlers modern english usage some writers of british english use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity  according to new harts rules style will dictate whether to use the serial comma and general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently no association with region or dialect is suggested other than that its use has been strongly advocated by oxford university Press.28  barbara child advises that is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series but claims that in the united states there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally.29 this is reinforced by an article by robert j samuelson in Newsweek.30 lynne truss says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the uk where it has been a slow steady trend for at least a century  nowadays a passage peppered with commaswhich in the past would have indicated painstaking and authoritative editorial attentionsmacks simply of no backbone people who put in all the commas betray themselves as moral weaklings with empty lives and out-of-date reference books 2004, pp 9798  in his 1963 book of spies and stratagems stanley p lovell recalls that during the second world war the british carried the comma over into abbreviations specifically operations executive was written nowadays even the full stops are frequently discarded  in other languagesedit  punctuation has been added to many languages which originally developed without it including a number of different comma forms european languages like german french italian spanish and portuguese use the same comma as english with similar spacing though usage may be somewhat different for instance in standard german subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas  modern greek uses the same unicode comma for its kmma and it is officially romanized as a latin comma,32 but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former hypodiastole a curved interpunct used to disambiguate certain homonyms the comma therefore functions as a silent letter in a handful of greek words principally distinguishing from  the enumeration or ideographic commaU3001 ideographic commais used in chinese japanese punctuation and somewhat in korean punctuation in the peoples republic of china and in northsouth korea this comma s pdnho is usually used only to separate items in lists while in japan it is the more common form of comma rtten litreading mark in documents that mix japanese and latin scripts the full-width comma fullwidth comma is used this is the standard form of comma s pduho in china since east asian typography permits commas to join clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought commas may separate subjects and predicates and constructions that would be considered a splice in english are acceptable and commonly encountered  korean punctuation uses both commas and interpuncts for lists  the comma in the arabic script by arabic urdu and persian etc is inverted upside-down arabic comma in order to distinguish it from the arabic diacritic ammah representing the vowel which is similarly comma-shaped.33 in arabic texts western-styled comma is used as a decimal point  reversed comma reversed comma is used in sindhi when written in arabic script it is different from the standard arabic comma  hebrew script is also written from right to left however hebrew punctuation includes only a regular comma  dravidian languages such as tamil telugu kannada and malayalam also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of european languages with similar spacing.34  computingedit  in the common character encoding systems unicode and ascii character 44 corresponds to the comma symbol the html numeric character reference is  in many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a function to separate elements in a list and to perform data designation on multiple variables at once  in the c programming language the comma symbol is an operator which evaluates its first argument may have side-effects and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument this is useful in for statements and macros  in smalltalk the comma operator is used to concatenate collections including strings  in prolog the comma is used to denote logical conjunction  the comma-separated values format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats  diacritical usageedit  main articles d-comma s-comma and t-comma  the comma is used as a diacritic mark in romanian under the s and under the t a cedilla is occasionally used instead of it in the unicode glyph names but this is technically incorrect the symbol d with comma below was used as part of the romanian transitional alphabet century to indicate the sounds denoted by the latin letter z or letters dz where derived from a cyrillic the comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive z placed below the letter from this standpoint alone and d could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for sz tz and dz respectively  in latvian the comma is used on the letters and historically also to indicate palatalization because the lowercase letter g has a descender the comma is rotated 180 and placed over the letter although their adobe glyph names are commas their names in the unicode standard are g k l n and r with a cedilla they were introduced to the unicode standard before 1992, and their name cannot be altered  in czech and slovak the diacritic in the characters and resembles a superscript comma but it is used instead of a caron because the letter has an ascender other ascender letters with carons such as letters in finnish romani and lakota and in skolt sami did not modify their carons to superscript commas  in 16th-century guatemala the archaic letter cuatrillo with a comma was used to write mayan languages.35  digits with commas are in the enclosed alphanumeric supplement unicode block  see alsoedit  list
