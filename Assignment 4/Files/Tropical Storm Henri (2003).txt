historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on august 22, a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa and it moved westward across the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea without developing significantly on september 1 the wave axis entered the gulf of mexico and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation the system moved northward and developed into tropical depression twelve on september 3 while located about 300miles west of tampa florida embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough the depression moved eastward and strengthened into tropical storm henri on september 5.1  remnants of henri making landfall on north carolina on september 12  despite strong southwesterly vertical shear henri continued intensifying while moving eastward and reached a peak strength of 60mph later on september 5. shortly thereafter though the shear greatly weakened the storm and it was downgraded to a tropical depression henri was not able to recover its intensity and made landfall near clearwater florida on september 6 as a 35mph tropical depression and quickly crossed the state as it accelerated to the northeast.1 despite initial predictions of re-intensification over open waters due to potentially lower shear,2 henri failed to re-strengthen and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on september 8 off the coast of north Carolina.1  the broad and disorganized remnant low remained nearly stationary due to a ridge of high pressure to its north.1 residual convection within the remnants of henri remained disorganized but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment.3 however it moved inland near cape hatteras on september 12 without reorganizing.4 the remnants continued to the north and dissipated on september 17 over new England.5  preparationsedit  the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning from englewood to indian pass florida while henri was a
