carol intensified to reach winds of 105mph but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift a strong trough of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward and carol later intensified into a major hurricanenb 1 while paralleling the mid-atlantic and southeastern united states the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and slight damage to houses in north carolina virginia washington dc delaware and new jersey the well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on eastern long island new york and then over eastern

the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression over the northeastern bahamas on August25.2 it moved to the north-northwest and intensified into a tropical storm early on August26.3 receiving the name carol the storm gradually turned to the north and strengthened under generally favorable conditions.2 on August26, the hurricane hunters reported an eye 23 miles in diameter despite carol being a tropical storm.4 the next day carol strengthened to attain hurricane status while located about 345miles east of cape canaveral Florida.2 with a large anticyclone persisting across the southeastern united States,5 the motion of carol turned to a northwest drift the hurricane continued to strengthen,4 and carol reached an initial peak intensity of 105mph on August28.3 by that time it was a small hurricane and the radius of maximum winds was smaller than normal for its latitude and central pressure.4 after maintaining peak intensity for 30hours and moving a distance of about 75miles carol weakened slightly off the coast of Georgia.2  an eastward moving deep-wave trough intensified as it moved through the eastern united states this caused carol to accelerate as it turned to the north and north-northeast.5 on August30, the hurricane again strengthened to reach category 2 status while located 180miles east of savannah georgia early on August31, carol passed very near cape hatteras north carolina with reconnaissance aircraft intensity estimates from 75125mph the hurricane continued north-northeastward with a forward motion of up to 39mph and carol intensified further to make landfall on eastern long island a category 3 hurricane with peak winds of 111mph after quickly crossing long island sound the hurricane made landfall again near groton Connecticut,.23 carol had maintained its small structure and well-defined eye and observers on both eastern long island and groton connecticut reported blue skies and light winds as the eye passed overhead followed by strong hurricane force winds the landfall intensity was based on a pressure of 957mbar recorded in groton Connecticut.4 ninety percent of homes in the groton long point area were destroyed by the storm surge and winds in hurricane Carol.6 carol quickly lost tropical characteristics while crossing into inland eastern massachusetts and became extratropical over southwestern new hampshire late on August31. the powerful extratropical storm continued northward and after entering canada lost its identity
