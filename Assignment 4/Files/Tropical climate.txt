tropical climate  locations of tropical climates with subtypes  aftropical rainforest climate  amtropical monsoon climate  awtropical savanna climate  a tropical climate in the kppen climate classification is a non-arid climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18C in tropical climates there are often only two seasons a wet season and a dry season tropical climates are frost-free and changes in the solar angle are small in tropical climates temperature remains relatively constant throughout the year  contents  1 sub types  1.1 tropical rain forest

within the tropical climate zone there are distinct varieties based on precipitation  tropical rain forest climateedit  main article tropical rainforest climate  all 12 months have average precipitation of at least 60mm these climates usually occur within 10 latitude of the equator this climate is dominated by the doldrums low-pressure system all year round so has no natural seasons in

monotonously wet throughout the year the northwest pacific coast of south and central america from ecuador to costa rica see for instance andagoya colombia but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest at palembang indonesia or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain at sitiawan malaysia  the term aseasonal refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly daily temperature throughout the year annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone albeit unrelated to temperature but to water availability whether as rain mist soil or ground water plant response g phenology animal migration reproduction etc and human activities sowing harvesting hunting fishing etc are tuned to this indeed in tropical south america and central america the season the water season is called invierno or inverno though it could occur in the northern hemisphere summer likewise the season water season is called verano or vero and can occur in the northern hemisphere winter  tropical monsoon climateedit  main article tropical monsoon climate  this type of climate results from the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month nearly always occurs at or soon after the solstice for that side of the equator with rainfall less than 60mm, but more than 125 the total annual precipitation.12001208  cities featuring a tropical monsoon climate  abidjan ivory coast  cairns queensland australia  chittagong

low teens to the mid-20s latitudes but occasionally an inner-tropical location san marcos antioquia colombia also qualifies actually the caribbean coast eastward from the gulf of urab on the colombiapanam border to the orinoco river delta on the atlantic ocean 4,000km, have long dry periods extreme is the bsh climate below characterised by very low unreliable precipitation present for instance in extensive areas in the guajira and coro western venezuela the northernmost peninsulas in south america which receive total annual precipitation practically all in two or three months  this condition extends to the lesser antilles and greater antilles forming the circum-caribbean dry belt the length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland at the latitude of the amazon riverwhich flows eastward just south of the equatorial linethe climate is af east from the andes between the dry arid caribbean and the ever-wet amazon are the orinoco rivers llanos or savannas from where this climate takes its name  sometimes as is used in place of aw if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days this is the case in parts of hawaii northwestern dominican republic cristi villa vsquez lupern east africa kenya sri lanka and brazilian northeastern coast joo pessoa and natal for instance in most places that have tropical wet and dry climates however the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of rain shadow effects during the part of the year  exceptionsedit  owing to different causes certain places within the tropics do not have a tropical climate such as some desert areas and alpine regions  examples  southern part of arabian peninsula  the sahara desert  alpine regions of the tropics mountaintops within the tropics eg mount kenya can be cold however like lowlands in the tropics unlike cold winter temperate zone regions there is little seasonal variation of temperature  intertropical convergence zoneedit  intertropical convergence zone vertical velocity at 500 hpa july average in units of pascals per second ascent values is equator descent values is more diffuse  because of the effect of sun angle on climate most areas within the tropics are hot year-round with diurnal variations in temperature exceeding seasonal variations seasonal variations in tropical climate are dominated by changes in precipitation which are in turn largely influenced by the tropical rain belt or intertropical convergence zone a portion of the hadley cell the itcz is shown for july average in the graphic areas of ascending air have heavy rainfall areas of descending air are dry the itcz somewhat follows the solar equator throughout the year but with geographical variations and in some areas is heavily influenced by local
