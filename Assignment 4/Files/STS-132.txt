Station.11 rassvet means in russian the module was built by russian aerospace company Energia.12 rassvet arrived at the kennedy space center aboard an antonov 124 cargo plane on 17 december 2009 at about 1300 EST.13 after it was unloaded from the antonov the module was transported to an astrotech processing bay in cape canaveral to undergo preparations for launch  an airlock and radiation heat exchanger to be used for outfitting the russian nauka module be launched in 2012, a spare elbow part of the european robotic arm and a portable work platform for science hardware for performing experiments in outer space were externally mounted on rassvet in its launch configuration.14 russian and us cargo to be delivered will also be accommodated inside the module the volume for cargo and science inside MRM1 is 5 cubic meters.15 rassvet was outfitted with iss standard grapple fixtures that allowed the module to be unloaded from the payload bay of atlantis using the stations robotic arm  integrated cargo carrier-vertical light deployable  ICC-VLD2 launch and return configurations  also on board atlantis was the integrated cargo carrier-vertical light deployable pallet holding a ku-band space to ground antenna the sgant boom assembly an enhanced orbital replacement unit temporary platform for the canadian dextre robotic arm extension video and power grapple fixtures and six new battery orus the six new batteries replaced older ones on the P6 truss of the iss the old batteries were placed on the icc-vld pallet for return to earth the eotp was built by macdonald dettwiler

2,645 pounds the total weight of iccvld and the orus is approximately 8,330 pounds icc-vld return mass is 2,933 kilograms  the icc-vld was berthed in the center of the shuttles payload bay for both launch and reentry.17  other itemsedit  in addition to the standard official flight kit flown inside a locker on the mid-deck two light weight tool stowage assemblies were modified to fly memorabilia and then were stowed to the left and right of atlantis airlock in the shuttles payload bay.18  a compact disk containing the digital copies of all entries submitted to nasas space shuttle program commemorative patch Contest19 was also flown aboard Atlantis.20 the contest was organized by the space shuttle program to mark the end of the shuttle era the winning patch was designed by mr blake dumesnil of hamilton sundstrand johnson space Center.21 a panel of nasa judges including shuttle program manager john shannon leroy cain and three other shuttle program managers including former astronaut john casper selected the winning patch from a pool of 85 entries by nasa employees and contractors  seventeen handcrafted beads made by nine different artists across north america were also on board atlantis during the STS-132 mission.2223 nasa teamed up with beads of courage inc an approved public charity to bring hope and inspiration to children coping with serious illnesses through the beads in space project the beads in space project is the brainchild of jamie newton an employee at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama the 17 beads weigh eight ounces and were selected after a contest organized by beads of courage that attracted 54 beads  also on board atlantis was a 4-inch long wood sample of sir isaac newtons apple tree.24 the piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired newtons theory of gravity along with a picture of newton were taken into orbit by astronaut piers sellers the wood is part of the collection of the royal society archives in london and was returned there following the flight.25  additionally a flag from clarkson university potsdam new york flew on board shuttle Atlantis.26 it was there in honor of STS-132 lead shuttle

event from more than 30 us states the district of columbia puerto rico belgium the netherlands new zealand and the united kingdom the tweetup participants met with shuttle technicians managers engineers and astronauts took a tour of the kennedy space center and viewed the launch of Atlantis.28  mission experimentsedit  atlantis crew worked with several short-term experiments during their mission the shuttle transported new long-term experiments to the iss at the end of the mission atlantis returned some of the completed experiments from the iss  short-term experiments included  Micro-2 researchers from rensselaer polytechnic institute sent microorganisms to investigate new ways of preventing the formation and spread of clusters of bacteria that could pose a threat to the health of astronauts.29 after the shuttle landed the resulting biofilms were examined to see how their growth and development were impacted by microgravity  hypersole hypersole is a canadian research project that plans to investigate sudden changes in skin sensitivity experienced by some astronauts in space.30 the researchers hope to understand more about how the skin sensitivity of the soles of the feet affect the human balance three STS-132 crew members participated in identical trials before the launch and immediately upon landing the trials were also repeated on five astronauts scheduled to fly on the STS-133 and STS-134 missions project findings are expected to add significant knowledge to existing studies of aging and to be beneficial for the elderly and people who suffer from balance problems  shuttle ionospheric modification with pulsed localized exhaust experiments STS-132 crew performed the simplex burn on flight day 12. the experiment investigates plasma turbulence driven by shuttle exhaust in the ionosphere using ground-based radars.31 the processes by which chemical releases can produce plasma turbulence are quantified with the simplex measurements plasma turbulence can affect military navigation and communications using radio systems they can also be used to promote communications by opening radio channels at abnormally high frequencies  shuttle processingedit  the missions external tank ET-136, began its 900-mile six-day journey across the gulf of mexico from nasas michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana on 24 february 2010.3233 ET-136 measured 154 feet long and 28 feet in diameter the solid rocket booster retrieval ship liberty star towed the et in the enclosed barge pegasus after docking in the turn basin at the kennedy space center the tank was offloaded and driven to the vehicle assembly building on 1 march 2010.34  on 29 march 2010, workers attached ET-136 to its solid rocket boosters a crane lifted the et into high bay no 1 inside the vab the day-long process was completed around 1800 edt as the tank was bolted to atlantiss twin solid rocket boosters.35  atlantis rolled out of its processing bay around 0700 edt on 13 april 2010. the shuttle entered the vab around 1100 edt for attachment to its external tank and solid rocket boosters.36 given that this was at the time believed to be atlantis final rollover for a mission the shuttle stopped for several hours en route to the vab allowing engineers and technicians to pose for photographs with the orbiter.37 the rollover occurred exactly 25 years after atlantis first arrived at the kennedy space center after a cross-country trip from the shuttle factory in palmdale California.38 the path to the rollover was without any incidents of major concern with only 22 interim problem reports noted during atlantis flow since its return from the STS-129 mission in november 2009.  the transport canister containing the STS-132 payload arrived at pad 39A on 15 april 2010 ahead of atlantis rollover to the launch pad.39 the canister was shaped like the shuttles 60-foot payload bay packed inside it were the MRM-1 module and the cargo-carrying pallet icc-vld  space shuttle atlantis began its rollout to launch pad 39A at 2331 edt on 21 april 2010.40 the complete shuttle stack and mobile launch platform were secured to the launch pads structure at 603 edt on 22 april 2010. the 3.4mi kilometres trek took 6 hours and 32 minutes to complete the rollout was originally planned for the evening of 19 april 2010, but wet weather and thunderstorms on the space coast caused several delays.4142  STS-132s payload was installed in the shuttles cargo bay on 25 april 2010.43  pad engineers preparing atlantis had noticed paint peeling from shuttles main payload the MRM-1 module although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of MRM-1, it holds a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit.44 engineers also noted MRM-1 cycled its fire and smoke detector self test several times similar events occurred during atlantis STS-129 mission in november 2009 when shuttle and station crew were awakened consecutive nights by false depressurization and fire alarms that originated from the MRM-2 module  an agency-wide flight readiness review was held at ksc in florida on 5 may 2010 to discuss atlantis launch preparations at the end of the review top nasa managers made the decision to officially set the launch for 14 may 2010 at 1420 EDT.4546 nasa held a post news conference to brief about the results of the frr the briefing was broadcast on nasa tv and was attended by nasas associate administrator for space operations william gerstenmaier space shuttle program manager john shannon and space shuttle launch director michael leinbach mr shannon mentioned that firstly ceramic inserts around atlantis windows and forward rocket pod were tested after an insert loosened during discoverys re-entry on STS-131, posing a potential impact threat the inserts had been re-installed on to atlantis using a thicker braided cord to reduce the chances of a backing out secondly it was mentioned that engineers had reviewed work to confirm that all systems on atlantis ku band antenna were in place the testing had been provoked after the failure of that communication system during STS-131. mr leinbach also acknowledged the skills and experience of the engineering teams and thanked the engineers who had successfully resolved hypergolic loading issues.47 hypergolics are chemicals that ignite when they come in contact with each other the propellants are used in the reaction control system that steers the shuttle in space  a booster rocket segment that had first flown 25 years before on atlantis maiden flight was used to help fly STS-132.48 the aft dome on the left solid rocket booster that lifted off to support atlantis STS-132 mission first launched STS-51-J on 3 october 1985. including STS-132, 18 of atlantis 32 flights were represented by the boosters segments  launch preparationsedit  atlantis astronauts traveled from johnson space center houston to the ksc launch site on 10 may 2010 to prepare for the launch the crew arriving in four northrop T-38 talon jets landed on the shuttle landing facility around 1849 EDT.49  the official countdown to liftoff started on 11 may 2010 after the countdown clocks at ksc were activated at 1600 edt ticking backward from the T-43 hour mark  program managers completed the L-2 mission management team meeting on 12 may 2010.50 at the end of the 18-minute-long meeting management team officially cleared atlantis for launch nasa held a pre-launch news conference to reveal the outcomes of the mmt and to brief the press on the upcoming launch the news conference was attended by chair pre-launch mission management team mike moses mike leinbach and STS-132 weather officer todd mcnamara the weather officer spoke of a favorable launch weather forecast due to a high pressure weather pattern and despite a low cloud ceiling calling a 70 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time he further elaborated on the predicted weather conditions at the transoceanic abort landing sites zaragoza and moron in spain and istres france in case of an emergency  the space shuttle program mmt met at 0415 edt on 14 may 2010 and gave a go to begin loading atlantis et with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen the fuel tanking operation began on time at 0455 edt and was completed within three hours at 0756 edt with replenishment fuel being added throughout the countdown  crew preparations for the launch day began at 0500 edt following an eight-hour overnight sleep an hour later they completed their final medical check ups crew suiting began around 1000 edt and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 1030 edt at around 1100 edt first commander ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat followed by pilot antonelli mission specialists bowen sellers reisman and good in order inside the orbiter all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly with all astronauts on board atlantis hatch was closed and latched for the flight inside the white room the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and checking for leaks before leaving the pad  launch day countdown procedures went without any major problems however atlantis encountered two minor issues the final inspection team looking for ice and frost buildup on the et had spotted a small stress fracture on an umbilical strut later during the post-launch news conference the chair of nasas pre-launch mission management team mike moses said that this was not unusual engineers also resolved any concerns about a loose ball bearing found near the shuttles payload bay days earlier the bearing was determined to likely be from a camera system and was ultimately ruled out as a concern  mission timelineedit  14 may day 1 launchedit  play media  the space shuttle external tank falls away min 16 secs  play media  launch video mins 57 secs  space shuttle atlantis launches from kennedy space center 14 may 2010.  the launch of space shuttle atlantis occurred on time at 1820 UTC,5152 with launch commentator george diller saying that the shuttle was the crest of its historic achievements in space powered flight conformed to the standard timeline with main engine cutoff occurring at 8 minutes and 32 seconds mission elapsed time the external tank ET-136, separated from the shuttle 15 seconds later at 847 MET.53 a further boost from the orbital maneuvering system engines was not required due to the nominal meco and atlantis settled into its planned preliminary orbit a subsequent NC-1 engine firing of about 26 seconds adjusted the orbital path of the shuttle to match that of the international space station by altering the shuttles velocity by about 41fts  nasa held a post-launch news conference with bill gerstenmaier alexey krasnov of the piloted programs directorate at the russian federal space agency mike moses and mike leinbach during the conference gerstenmaier made mention of a piece of space junk that could potentially have impacted atlantis planned arrival at the ISS.54  more than 39,000 guests including television host david letterman ex-apollo astronaut buzz aldrin and former nasa administrator michael griffin witnessed the launch.55 the russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the head of the russian space federal agency anatoly perminov were also present at KSC.56  once in orbit the crew opened the shuttles payload bay doors activated the radiators and deployed the ku band antenna successfully they also completed a checkout of the orbiters shuttle remote manipulator system the crew was also successful in downlinking all imagery from atlantis umbilical well cameras along with crew video of ET-136, for review by imagery experts in the ground.57 preliminary inspections showed that ET-136 was very clean and had performed well during the ascent with only a few foam liberation incidents visible  it is worth noting that the launch of atlantis on STS-132 was supposed to be its last the mission patch depicted atlantis flying into the sunset as she retired and the space shuttle program patches on sale at the kennedy space center for the launch showed the years 19812010 for the program the programme guide magazine to the launch also cited the launch as the final flight of space shuttle atlantis however on its return atlantis was readied as a rescue shuttle for the that time two remaining missions of STS-133 and STS-134. it could be launched on need if there was a problem and if not it would be stood down then later in 2010, nasa decided to fly the previously provision STS-135 mission and chose atlantis for the flight given that discover and endeavour were earmarked for STS-133 and STS-134 respectively the funding was found and a decision was taken to fly STS-135 as the final space shuttle mission with atlantis as the orbiter the STS-135 mission launched in july 2011, just over a year after atlantiss launch on the STS-132 mission  15 may day 2 tps surveyedit  atlantis cargo bay and its vertical stabilizer  the crew members aboard atlantis began their first full day in space at 0820 UTC.58 the day was primarily devoted to inspecting atlantiss thermal protection system using the shuttles robotic arm and the orbiter boom sensor system to look for any signs of launch damage before the thermal protection checkout began the crew encountered a problem with the laser dynamic range imager and the intensified tv camera due to a snagged cable in that systems pan and tilt unit.59 as a result mission control decided to switch to the less-capable backup sensor system sensor package 2, a laser camera and a digital camera mounted near the end of the obss sensor package 2 required an additional light source as daylight had a resolution of a few millimeters and could scan at about 2.5inches per second.60 the crew followed inspection procedures for surveying and images of the right wing the nose cap and much of the left wing were sent to the ground for detailed analysis  commander kenneth ham installed the center-line camera in the orbiter docking system to help him during atlantis approach to the iss down on the shuttles middeck good and bowen spent several hours checking out spacesuits and preparing them for transfer to the station reisman spent much of his day working with antonelli and ham on the tps survey he also assisted with the suit and spacewalk equipment checkouts the crew furthermore performed the ods ring extension that would connect the shuttles docking port to the stations harmony module the last portion of the crews day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools to be used during the rendezvous  two course correction burns were also performed on flight day 2. the first 10-second burn dubbed NC-2, was performed using the right-hand oms engine changing the shuttles speed by 8fts the burn raised both the apogee and perigee of the shuttles orbit by 1-mile atlantis reaction control jets were again fired for a second time to execute the 8-second NC-3 burn which changed the shuttles velocity by about 2fts  meanwhile mission control managers determined that the iss would not need an avoidance maneuver to avoid a piece of orbital debris updated tracking information showed that the iss and the debris would not pass close enough the following day to require any action  snagged cable in the sensor package pan and tilt unit  garrett g reisman in the middeck of atlantis  blue and white part of

caldwell dyson operated the robotic arm.68 throughout eva 1, commander ken ham oversaw the extravehicular activities  during the spacewalk several problems were encountered,69 the first of which was during installation of the sgant a slight gap was observed between the antenna dish and its mounting pole the spacewalkers loosened the bolts and used a higher torque setting which managed to close the gap to a smaller width the launch locks were left on the sgant to allow engineers on the ground to determine if the gap was acceptable or if more troubleshooting would be needed the second problem occurred during the installation of the sgant and was related to the command and control computers.70 during installation when steve bowen removed a cover from a connector the prime cnc computer detected an error and shut down the cap was a special cap which allowed the circuit for that connector to be closed so when it was opened the sensor detected an error the shut down of the cnc caused a 2-minute loss of communications the safeing of the computer also stopped the Canadarm2 for a reconfiguration of the cameras being used during the spacewalk by both the robotic arm operators and observers on the ground.71  the spacewalk ended at 1919 utc after reisman and bowen made an inventory of the tools they brought with them and made their way back into the quest airlock STS-132s eva 1

the scheduled start which already had been moved up 30 minutes  lead spacewalker bowens first task was to remove a cable snag in the obsss pan and tilt mechanism bowen looped a tie wrap on two cables to relieve the snag and completed the task in less than 30 minutes while good began work with the batteries.79 although the initial plan was to replace three batteries the two astronauts managed to replace an additional fourth battery during eva 2. the batteries bowen and good replaced had originally been launched in november 2000. after the battery work and cleanup of the area bowen and good moved on to the new backup ku band antenna on the Z1 truss they tightened bolts holding the antennas dish to its boom closing a gap left there after eva 1. good performed a wiggle test and confirmed that two spacewalkers did not see any signs of motion in the antenna-mast interface they then removed the antennas launch locks leaving the antenna ready to operate.80  during eva 2, commander ken ham provided photo and television support and pilot tony antonelli served as the spacewalk choreographer iss crew member tracy caldwell dyson also assisted with spacewalk preparations eva 2 marked the 238th conducted by us astronauts the fifth for bowen and the third for good it was also the 145th in support of international space station assembly and maintenance  20 may day 7 MRM-1 initial checks transfers and off-dutyedit  good bowen and reisman pose for a photo with an extravehicular mobility unit  on flight day 7, the crew spent a few hours of off-duty time in the afternoon but otherwise were largely focused on preparations for eva 3. earlier in the day at 1052 utc following leak checks iss expedition 23 commander oleg kotov and flight engineer alexander skvortsov opened the hatch to the MRM-1 module.81 they wore eye and breathing protection as a standard precaution when entering a new module kotov reported that some metal filings were drifting around inside the new module as unpacking activities gathered pace although initially he reported the interior of MRM-1 looked clean flight controllers both in houston and moscow worked with the crew to develop a technique for safely removing the floating debris  at 1225 utc shuttle crew members ken ham tony antonelli piers sellers and iss flight engineer tracy caldwell dyson talked with the associated press fox news radio and cbs News.82 ham also joined in with past and present members of mission control to recognize lonnie j schmitt as the first flight controller to reach his 100th shuttle mission  during the day ham antonelli and sellers transferred equipment supplies and experiments between atlantis and the iss mission specialists mike good and garrett reisman prepared for eva 3, configuring tools and preparing suits and the quest airlock ham antonelli and sellers also joined them to review the procedures as part of the campout procedure the two spacewalkers spent the night in the quest airlock with its air

may day 8 eva 3edit  on flight day 8, mike good and garret reisman completed eva 3, the third and final spacewalk of the STS-132 mission.83 the pair connected a pair of ammonia jumpers on the P4P5 truss segment before continuing on out to the end of the P6 truss once at the P6 truss good and reisman completed the battery swap by removing and replacing the final two batteries and retrieving the temporarily stowed old battery on the truss once that task was complete good and reisman moved to atlantiss payload bay where they removed a grapple fixture and took it to the quest airlock the pair then moved on to fix some insulation on the dextre robot and stowed some tools in an external toolbox on the Z1 truss pilot tony antonelli choreographed the spacewalk from inside the shuttle  while the spacewalk was going on commander ken ham and mission specialist steve bowen completed some more of the transfer work for the mission.84  good and reisman look through the aft flight deck windows

undocking  flight day 9 saw the shuttle crew enjoying some off-duty time during the afternoon in the morning the entire crew participated in some transfer activities and orbiter maintenance the icc-vld was also berthed back aboard atlantis payload bay having completed its tasks for this mission.85 the Canadarm2 was used to return the icc-vld to the bay and was operated by mission specialists piers sellers and garrett reisman and space station flight engineer tracy caldwell dyson the icc-vld re-installation operation began just after 430am edt and was completed at 550am edt the shuttle crew and caldwell dyson also answered some questions from elementary- and middle-school students from around the U.S.86 students from 12 nasa explorer schools had submitted their questions earlier by video the combined shuttle-station crew also shared a joint meal before the shuttle crew enjoyed two and a half hours of off-duty time starting at 1105am edt  23 may day 10 undockingedit  on flight day 10, the joint STS-132Expedition 23 crews awoke to begin the final hours of the joint docked mission the crews completed the final time-sensitive transfers of the mission which included scientific research samples that need to be kept cold once these transfers were completed the two crews held a joint crew news conference and took a crew photo and later prior to hatch closure held a mutual farewell ceremony after the ceremony the hatches between atlantis and the international space station were closed and a leak check was performed to ensure all the hatches were sealed properly the shuttle undocked from the iss at 1522 utc a little more than 2 hours after the hatches were closed.8788 at the time of the undocking the two spacecraft were orbiting 220 miles above the southern ocean southwest of perth australia the shuttle guided by pilot tony antonelli backed away from the iss to a distance of about 400 feet at which time antonelli began conducting a fly-around of the space station so that crew members on both the iss and shuttle could get photos of both vehicles once the fly-around was complete the shuttle crew conducted two separation burns to move atlantis away from the space station.89  STS-132 shirts and expedition 23 crew members pose for a group portrait on the iss  ham and kotov shake hands at the farewell ceremony  atlantis separates from the iss after undocking  departing atlantis as photographed by a station crew member  24 may day 11 late inspectionedit  the crew of atlantis awoke on flight day 11, and after a couple of hours of personal time began the late inspection of the shuttles wing leading edges and nose cap.9091 the crew finished the scans about two and a half hours ahead of schedule by 0950 utc they had finished their look at the right wing by 1052 utc the nose cap survey was complete and the left wing survey was finished at 1117 UTC.92 the tps survey was done using the shuttles robotic arm and its obss extension while the scans were going on some of the crew stowed items that were no longer needed or were transferred right before undocking spacewalkers mike good and steve bowen cleaned up and stowed their spacesuits for landing.93 the latter part of the crews day was spent with some off-duty time  25 may day 12 landing prepedit  atlantis astronauts devoted flight day 12 to preparing for the shuttles landing.94 the crew executed standard day-before-landing activities.95 commander ham pilot antonelli and mission specialist good began the flight control system hot-fire checkout at about 140am edt operating the rudder and flaps that would control atlantis flight through the atmosphere to the ksc runway that complete ham and antonelli fired each of the shuttles 44 attitude control thrusters which were designed to orient atlantis in space as it descended from orbit and through the upper atmosphere both these tests were completed successfully  all STS-132 crew members worked at various times throughout the day to stow items in the cabin to prepare for landing they also gathered for a 30-minute deorbit briefing at 540am edt immediately afterward the crew talked with representatives of the colbert Report,96 abc radio network and wews-tv of cleveland ohio  late in the day mission specialists reisman and sellers stowed the ku band antenna in atlantis cargo bay  26 may day 13 re-entry and

UTC.97 at about 740 utc the astronauts began deorbit preparations and closed the payload bay doors at 901 utc the deorbit burn initiated at 1142 utc 220 miles above indonesia and terminated at 1145. at an altitude of 400,000 feet and a speed of mach 25, atlantis began re-entry at 1216. at about 1223 utc atlantis began its s-rolls to bleed off speed and energy during re-entry at about 1229, the shuttle was more than 40 miles above the earth and 2,000 miles from ksc traveling at mach 22. at 1234, atlantis was about 180,000 feet up traveling at about 9,200mph, and was 600 miles from the runway at about the same time the shuttle was experiencing maximum re-entry heating conditions peaking at about 2,900 degrees fahrenheit lasting about two minutes at 1239, long-range cameras at ksc spotted the shuttle gliding towards the runway at an altitude of 16 miles and a distance of 77 miles from ksc at 1244, commander ken ham took manual control of the orbiter for landing as it glided below the 50,000-foot mark  atlantis landed on its main wheels on runway 33 of kennedy space centers shuttle landing facility at 084811 edt UTC.98 the nose wheel touched down 10 seconds later at 084821 edt utc with the vehicle coming to a stop at 084918 edt UTC.99 the entire mission lasted 11 days 18 hours 29 minutes and 9 seconds during which time the space shuttle traveled a total of 7,724,851 kilometers

electricity from the solar arrays on that truss the used batteries were installed on the cargo carrier for return to earth on atlantis they also fixed a snagged cable on the orbiter boom sensor system the final task was to re-torque the bolts on the sgant and then remove the launch locks and tether that were helping hold it in place  eva 3  michael good  garrett reisman  21 may 2010  1027  21 may 2010  1713  6 hours 46 minutes  good and reisman first connected a liquid ammonia jumper hose they then installed the final two new batteries on the truss and put the old batteries on the carrier next they retrieved a grapple fixture from atlantis payload bay and brought it inside the station to be modified for future installation on the zarya module the pair also stowed some tools in an external toolbox outside the airlock for future spacewalks  mission insigniaedit  the STS-132 mission patch was designed by nasa artist sean collins working with astronaut garrett Reisman.102 the patch shows atlantis flying towards a sunset landing with the names of the STS-132 astronauts around the border  STS-132 mission decaledit  during the standard post-flight inspection of atlantis a united space alliance inspector found a STS-132 mission decal accompanied by an inscription first last flight of atlantis left earth on 14 may 2010 from pad 39A together with the crews signatures.103104 the worker had found it tucked away on the upper side of locker A-16 while scanning the area with a mirror moreover he said the note must have been written in orbit since otherwise the author would have had to stand on their head to write it  at the time the note was written STS-132 was indeed the last planned mission of atlantis however one further mission was ultimately approved for the shuttle STS-135, which will be the last flight of both atlantis and the space shuttle program  wake-up callsedit  nasa began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the gemini program and first used music to wake up a flight crew during apollo 15. each track is specially chosen often by the astronauts families and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew or is applicable to their daily activities.105106  flight day  song  artist  played for  links  day 2  my home  billy joel  kenneth ham  wav MP3  transcript  day 3  home alabama  lynyrd skynyrd  dominic a antonelli  wav MP3
