September4 as it tracked westward several fluctuations in strength occurred before ike made landfall on eastern cuba on September8. the hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the gulf of mexico but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall on galveston texas on September13. the remnants of ike continued to track across the united states and into canada causing considerable damage inland before dissipating two days later  ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths of these deaths 74 were in haiti which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms gustav and hanna which had made landfall that same year seven people were killed in cuba by Ike.1 in the united states 113 people were reported killed directly or indirectly and 16 were still missing as of august 2011.2 due to its immense size ike caused devastation from the louisiana coastline all the way to the kenedy county region near corpus christi Texas.3 in addition ike caused flooding and significant damage along the mississippi coastline and the florida Panhandle4 damages from ike in us coastal and inland areas are estimated at with additional damage of in cuba costliest storm ever in

historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of hurricane ike can be traced back to a well-defined tropical wave first identified by the national hurricane centernhc just within the western coast of africa on August28.1516 despite the development of a low-pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the cape verde Islands,17 the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity the broad low-pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September1. by this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles kilometers west of cape verde although post-analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 1200UTC that day,18 operationally the nhc began issuing advisories on ike three hours later by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established outflow.19 over the next few hours ike developed additional rainbands,20 but failed to a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storms south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures.21 these factors were also responsible for ikes slow developmental trend that began after formation.18  meteorological prediction of ikes path on september 3, 2008  ikes gradual strengthening began to quicken early on September3, with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm at roughly 1500UTC that day microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm.18 tracking northwestward the nhc upgraded ike to hurricane status at 1800UTC based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery.1822 during this time ike was centered 690mi east-northeast of the leeward islands and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast.18 ikes placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north,22 reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane.23 at 0600UTC on September4, ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour kilometers per hour and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars inches of mercury making the storm a Category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale after peaking in strength a ridge of high pressure to the storms west strengthened causing ike to track towards the southwesta path unusual for the time of year however this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear,18 causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on September4 and weaken,24 briefly dropping below major hurricane status on September6 while 150 miles east of grand turk Island.25 although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days after passing near the turks and caicos islands ike made its first landfall on inagua in the bahamas at 1300UTC on September7 with winds of 125mph  after passing over Inagua,26 the development of a double eyewalla feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycleslightly weakened ike late on September7.27 however the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach Category4 intensity for a final time before making landfall near cabo lucrecia on the coast of holgun province in cuba by 0000UTC the next day.26 although ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern Cuba,28 the hurricanes core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the caribbean sea after spending a few hours over land.29 over the next day ike tracked westward paralleling the southern coast of cuba without much intensification at times the center of the hurricane was within 12mi of the island at around 1400UTC on September9, ike made a second cuban landfall this time on punta la capitana in pinar del rio with winds of 80mph roughly six hours later the hurricane emerged into the gulf of mexico as a slightly weakened system.26  despite tracking back over water ikes prolonged interaction with cuba had greatly disrupted the systems core and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing the storms wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued.26 due to the storms comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands,30 an eyewall replacement cycle took place preventing ike from rapidly intensifying at around the same time a high-pressure area strengthened to the hurricanes north steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated moving over the warm waters of the loop Current,26 ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 0000UTC with an estimate of 944mbar though winds would continue to strengthen afterward the storms pressure would rise.31 by late on September12, ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure area and began to curve northward the formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds,26 and at 0700UTC on September13, ike made landfall on the northeast end of galveston island in texas with a minimum barometric pressure of 950mbar and sustained winds of 110mph making ike a Category2 hurricane.31 after tracking inland ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward weakening to tropical storm status east of palestine texas late on September13 and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on September14 over the Ozarks.26 a more steady weakening phase ensued and after tracking across southern ontario and quebec the remnants of ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the st lawrence river on September15.32  preparationsedit  turks and caicos and the bahamasedit  fearing a repeat of hurricane donna in 1960, the overseas branch of the british red cross began preparing contingency plans

response network activated its 700-member utility mutual aid network and began coordination with the state emergency operations center and the texas commission on environmental quality to begin preparations and notifications to utilities to prepare for Ike.37 state rural water associations activated mutual aid networks to prepare for the landfall of ike while still providing assistance to areas affected by hurricane Gustav.3839 the texas rural water association held meetings with state agencies on september 9, to plan for landfall along the texas gulf Coast.4041  on september 11, forecasting models began to show ike making landfall just south of galveston city manager steven leblanc late wednesday issued a mandatory evacuation order for the low-lying west end of galveston Island.42 later the mandatory evacuation order was extended to the entire island of galveston as well as low-lying areas around houston Texas.43 mandatory evacuations were also ordered for jefferson orange and chambers counties located east of houston voluntary evacuations were in effect for hardin and tyler as well as newton and jasper counties.44 residents evacuating ahead of ike were received by emergency workers in the dallasfort worthdfw metroplex where they were provided a place of refuge medical treatment and provisions in addition to the orders of local and state officials federal officials were thoroughly involved in evacuation decisions on september 10, us president george w bush made an emergency declaration for texas making more federal help available for preparations and evacuations.45 more than one million people evacuated in advance of hurricane ike but more than 100,000 people did not.46  at 819pm september 11, the national weather service in houstongalveston texas issued a strongly worded bulletin regarding storm surge along the shoreline of galveston bay the bulletin advised that residents living in single-family homes in some parts of coastal texas faced death if they did not heed orders to evacuate.474849 reports said as many as 40 percent of galvestons citizens did not pay attention to the warnings.50 it was feared to be much the same in port arthur and it was predicted that low-lying areas between morgan city louisiana and baffin bay texas particularly those areas east of ikes projected eye landfall would experience the greatest damage from storm surges of up to 20 feet  the price of gas increased in the expectation of damage to some of the numerous oil refineries along the south texas coast or at least delays in production from the oil

hurricane Center707172nb 2  due to the intensity of the storm texas closed many of its chemical plants and oil refineries because much of the united states oil refining capacity is located in texas the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline home heating oil and natural gas.73 increases were particularly high in north carolina especially in the mountains where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average.74 the closing of refineries so soon after hurricane gustav and the time required to restart production also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the carolinas and tennessee partly as a result of panic buying.75 113 direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the us including 85 in texas direct eight in louisiana

gusts were measured up to 89mph strong winds on the backside of the system produced a large dust storm in northern areas of the island.124  aftermathedit  turks and caicos and the bahamasedit  due to the damage brought by ike in the turks and caicos islands the insular government declared the islands of grand turk and south caicos as disaster areas damage on the islands was surveyed immediately following the hurricanes passage by a cdera assessment team from jamaica following the occurrence of extensive power outages the caribbean electric utilities services cooperation offered to support the restoration of power services the british hms iron duke was sent to the islands to assist in recovery efforts and personnel from the british red cross were also dispatched.125  criticism of aidedit  after hurricane ike many residents applied to fema for loans and fema trailers many residents were forced to wait several weeks until their trailers arrived some waited for up to two months living in hotels in homes of relatives several miles away or in their homes with no power or running water many residents were angry at the response that fema gave to the problem texas state leaders also accused fema of foot dragging and insensitivity.126  billion in federal aid was eventually allocated to texas by the department of housing and urban development it was supposed to be used to repair single-family homes of lower and middle-class income families but as of 2011 only 10 of those funds were released while the rest were held up because of bureaucracy.127  public and mental health issuesedit  hurricane ike also brought many health issues to the victims damages from the homes and the environment helped create these issues amongst the public following the disaster communities were challenged to provide the correct medical treatment in emergency rooms and other medical facilities it developed stress restricting victims their basic health services orange county had an 88.5 percent capacity loss of intermediate care facilities reducing its overall capacity by late october five hospitals that usually served the areas that were impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of patients.128  the need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder most individuals will not progress in constant behavioral or mental health problems but the world health organization estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long-term issues.128 telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of hurricane ike post disaster mental health occurrences were 5.9 percent for post-traumatic stress disorder 4.5 percent for major depressive episode and 9.9 percent for general anxiety disorder.129 a galveston bay recovery study was a survey distributed through a random stratified cluster sampling of victims in the galveston bay area for research on traumatic stress and disaster exposure when surveyed victims were asked how they felt and what they experienced after the hurricane there was an immediate emotional response of fear from the loss of property employment displacement and damages.130 children were targeted for physical abuse by parents and guardians because of loss of property and employment.128 results of post-traumatic stress disorder depressive symptoms anxiety symptoms dysfunctions and disabilities were reported when asked how stressful their lives have been since hurricane Ike.130 there was an increase of impairments interference with social activities and health behaviors such as eating poorly smoking more and restlessness.130 development of these mental health problems was due to the lack of sufficient clean clothing electricity food money transportation or water for at least one week  victims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community an exposure to hazardous materials through the process created health threats of diseases air contamination smoke inhalation and lead poisoning as disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the debris and other hazards developing a risk of injury.128 after the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing carbon monoxide poisoning eighty-two percent to 87 percent of carbon monoxide were caused by the improper use of generators the texas department of state health services issued that gasoline generators should not be used indoor.131 fifty-four people were reported by the texas poison centers to have storm related carbon monoxide exposure the undersea and hyperbaric medical society and the center for disease control reported 15 people had to undergo hyperbaric oxygen treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning.131132 symptoms from exposure were headaches nausea and vomiting with the majority of the treated cases under the age of eighteen.132133  sportsedit  hurricane ike forced the houston astros and the chicago cubs to play out their 3-game set in milwaukee at miller Park.134 ike also forced the postponement of the second-week nfl game between the houston texans and the baltimore ravens the game was later made up in houston after repairs were made to reliant stadium on november 9, 2008. it also forced the ncaa football game on september 13 between the houston cougars and the air force falcons to be moved from robertson stadium in houston to gerald ford stadium in Dallas.135 ike also forced the postponement of a texas longhorns game in Austin,136 texas due to increased evacuee traffic in the citys shelters tickets for world wrestling entertainment wrestlemania xxv were originally scheduled to go on sale september 20, 2008, but it was postponed due to the effect of ike on the state of texas until november 8, 2008.137138  relief effortsedit  there were a number of relief efforts set up to help those caught up in ike including one set up by portlight and weather underground most of them raised at least to help out.139 the portlightweather underground effort created some initial controversy springing from the unexpected overwhelming response to requests for assistance  portlight delivered over worth of equipment to people with disabilities and outlying communities that were impacted by hurricane ike they also delivered pizza to the residents of the hard-hit bolivar peninsula and helped provide a christmas party for residents of bridge city Texas.140141  oil and gas spillsedit  hurricane ikes winds surge and giant waves tossed storage tanks and punctured pipelines however operators in the gulf of mexico from major integrated producers like bp and shell to small privately owned independents shut in operations in advance of ikes approach as a precautionary measure as a result of these shut-ins us oil production dropped from 5 million barrels per day cubic meters per day to 4Mbbld in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane by late november production was restored to pre-ike levels despite the hurricane only 500,000 us gallons cubic meters of crude oil spilled into the gulf of mexico and the marshes bayous and bays of louisiana and texas over a coastline distance of 185 miles kilometres much of the spillage occurred in the high island area of galveston county texas where storm surge rose over a low-lying oilfield and flooded the marshy area around several producing wells beam pumps and storage tanks during the days both before and after the storm companies and residents reported around 448 releases of gas oil and other substances into the environment in louisiana and texas the hardest hit places were industrial centers near houston and port arthur texas as well as oil production facilities off louisianas coast.142  the coast guard with the environmental protection agency and state agencies has responded to more than 3,000 pollution reports associated with the storm and its surge along the upper texas coast most callers complain about abandoned propane tanks paint cans and other hazardous materials containers turning up in marshes backyards and other places.143  collision of oil tanker with drilling rigedit  on march 6, 2009, a 159,000-ton norwegian tanker sks satilla collided with jackup drilling rig ensco 74, operated by ensco plc which had been missing after ike struck.144 the tankers double hull prevented an oil spill at the site 65 miles south of galveston which is 115 miles west of the original position of the rig.145 four drilling rigs including ensco 74, were damaged by ike but ensco 74 was the only missing rig at least 52 oil platforms were damaged by Ike.146  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  because of the tremendous damage number of deaths and people left missing the name ike was officially retired on april 22, 2009 by the world meteorological organization and will never be used again for an atlantic tropical cyclone it was replaced with isaias in the 2014 season.147 isaias however was not used in 2014, so it could be used in 2020.148  future mitigationedit  see also ike dike  a commission was established by rick perry the texas governor following the hurricane to investigate preparing for and mitigating future disasters a proposal has been put forth to build an dike a massive levee system which would protect the galveston bay and the important industrial facilities which line the coast and the ship channel from a future potentially more destructive storm the proposal has gained widespread support from a variety of business interests as of 2009update, it is currently only at the conceptual stage.149  see alsoedit  houston portal  tropical cyclones portal  list of costliest atlantic hurricanes  list of atlantic
