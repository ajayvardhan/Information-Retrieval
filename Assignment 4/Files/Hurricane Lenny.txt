second-strongest november atlantic hurricane on record behind the 1932 cuba hurricane lenny formed on November13 in the western caribbean sea and maintained an unprecedented west-to-east track for its entire duration it attained hurricane status south of jamaica on november 15 and passed south of hispaniola and puerto rico over the next few days lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern caribbean on November17, attaining peak winds of 155mph about 21mi south of saint croix in the united states virgin islands it gradually weakened while moving through the leeward islands eventually dissipating on November23 over the open atlantic ocean  before moving through the lesser antilles lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern colombia strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern puerto rico despite the hurricanes passage near saint croix at peak intensity damage on the small island was only described as although there was widespread flooding and erosion damage in the united states territories totaled about the highest precipitation total was 34.12in at the police station on the french side of saint martin on the island the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200properties. in nearby antigua and barbuda the hurricane killed one person torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply

scale  hurricane lenny began as a low-pressure area that was first observed in the southwestern caribbean sea on November8. it developed an area of convection but remained poorly defined for the next few days thunderstorms spread across the region producing heavy rainfall in portions of mexico and central america on November13, the system became better organized a hurricane hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about 35mph the data indicated the development of tropical depression sixteen at 1800UTC, about 175mi south of the cayman Islands.1 the depressions convection was fairly disorganized and the national hurricane center did not anticipate any strengthening for three days.2 for much of its existence the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the caribbean sea which was unprecedented in the atlantic hurricane database earning it the nickname lenny the path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western atlantic Ocean.1  after its formation the depression gradually became better organized3 the nhc upgraded it to tropical storm lenny on November14,1 based on reports from the hurricane hunters when it was first upgraded to a tropical storm the cyclone already had winds of 65mph and a developing eye feature.4 at 0000UTC on November15, lenny attained hurricane status about 175mi southwest of kingston Jamaica.1 the quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center at the same time lenny developed an anticyclone aloft which provided favorable conditions for the hurricanes development.5 after moving east-southeastward during its initial development stages the hurricane turned more to the east on November15. the hurricane hunters reported winds of 100mph which indicated that lenny had become a Category2 on the saffir-simpson hurricane Scale.6 however the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared and lennys winds weakened to 85mph while the hurricane passed south of Hispaniola.1 the nhc noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storms small inner core by environmental changes after the sudden weakening,7 the hurricane hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricanes winds had reached 100mph at the time a ridge was expected to build to lennys east and turn the storm northeastward into puerto rico 24hours later.8  beginning on November16, hurricane lenny underwent a 24-hour period of rapid deepening reaching major hurricane status about 165mi south of the mona Passage.1 it developed well-defined banding features good outflow and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in san juan puerto Rico.9 the hurricane continued to become better organized with an eye 29mi in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall.10 around 1200UTC on November17, lenny intensified into a Category4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern caribbean it was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year setting the record for most Category4 hurricanes in a season.1 the hurricane then made its closest approach to puerto rico passing about 75mi southeast of Maunabo.11 shortly thereafter lenny attained peak winds of 155mph while passing 21mi south of the island of saint croix in the united states virgin Islands.1 this made it the second-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of November.12 hurricane hunters reported lennys peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane the group also reported a minimum pressure of 933mbar, a drop of 34mbar in 24hours. in addition a dropsonde recorded winds of 210mph while descending to the surface the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time.1  around the time it peaked in intensity lennys forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges despite favorable conditions for strengthening the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters late on November18, lennys eye moved over saint martin with winds of 125mph after continued weakening the hurricane struck anguilla and saint barthlemy the next day it turned southeastward while still drifting bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern Caribbean.1 late on November19, lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased wind shear exposed the cyclones center from the deepest convection.113 early on November20, the storm made landfall on Anguilla,1 although by then the center had become difficult to locate.14 later that day the cyclone exited the Caribbean,15 continuing its southeast track on November21, lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression.1 the deep convection was located at least 100mi east of the increasingly elongated center.16 lenny turned to the east for the final time early on November22, dissipating the next day about 690mi east of the lesser Antilles.1  preparationsedit  hurricane lenny south of saint croix  early in lennys duration a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for jamaica later a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of hispaniola and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the dominican Republic.1 haitian officials declared a state of alert in three southern provinces and allocated about in hurricane funds.17 residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern haiti and in the neighboring dominican Republic.1819  a hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico and the virgin islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later.1 by that time lenny was projected to move over puerto Rico.8 after lenny made its closest approach to the island the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the virgin Islands.1 in puerto rico the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the san juan national weather service office based on the coverage the public was well informed of the hurricanes threat to the island before the storm and as a result of its impact around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. this included 1,190residents in ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western puerto Rico.20 officials closed all schools banned the sale of alcohol and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies.21 the federal emergency management agency activated six medical assistance teams three medical support teams and two advance medical assessment units the agency stored five days worth of food in schools in the us virgin Islands.22 before the hurricanes arrival us virgin islands governor charles wesley turnbull declared a state of emergency.23 in st croix 309people rode out the storm in shelters.11 officials opened eight shelters in the british virgin Islands.20 there airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.24  governments across the eastern caribbean issued hurricane warnings as far south as Montserrat.1 in anguilla residents near the coast were advised to evacuate schools closed ahead of the storm and the ferry between the island and saint martin was halted and moved to a safe location in saint kitts and nevis the national emergency management agency was activated on November16. officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate and one shelter was located in each district of the country in addition stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies.25 most businesses and schools were closed in antigua and barbuda during the storm while in dominica the airport was closed.26 further south there was little warning for the hurricane in grenada and most people left their boats in the water.27  impactedit  death toll by area  statecountry  deaths  colombia  2  saint martin  3  guadeloupe  5  martinique  1  offshore  6  total  17  across the eastern caribbean hurricane lenny damaged vital infrastructure including roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands most of the islands tourism areas were on western-facing beaches many of which were unprepared for the high waves and winds produced by Lenny.28  central caribbeanedit  early in its existence lenny produced large waves and high tides along the guajira peninsula in Colombia,1 sinking two boats and flooding 1,200houses. there were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops in the country strong winds on the storms fringe killed a man by striking him with a beam although there were initial reports of nine people missing,17 only two were counted in the death toll for mainland Colombia.1 two sailors were killed offshore when their yacht was lost in the southern caribbean Sea.1  along the abc islands off the north coast of venezuela the hurricane produced 10-to-20ft waves along the southwest coastlines.29 the waves caused heavy beach erosion and coastal damage to properties and boats.30  in jamaica the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall but left little damage rains in the dominican republic caused flooding in the countrys southwest portion.19 flooding around les cayes in southwestern haiti destroyed 60percent of the rice corn and banana plantations while high waves wrecked several houses in Cavaellon.21  hurricane lenny was originally forecast to strike puerto rico although it remained south of the island.1 beginning on November17, lenny affected puerto rico with gusty winds and heavy rainfall rainfall in the days prior to lennys approach left areas susceptible to flooding which caused many rivers in the northeastern portion of the island to overflow their banks following the storm such flooding forced towns to evacuate along the rivers and also resulted in the closure of secondary and primary highways the heavy rains also caused mudslides and rockslides.11 the peak rainfall on the island was 14.64in in jayuya in central puerto Rico.31 tides in san juan were about 1.8ft above normal there high seas washed a 546ft freighter ashore winds in the puerto rican mainland were not significant gusting to 48mph in ceiba the storm left 22,000people without power and 103,000people without water.11 because of the heavy rainfall about 200farmers in southeastern puerto rico sustained about in crop damage in the affected region the heavy rainfall destroyed 80percent of the vegetables and 50percent of the plantains damage throughout the island totaled  virgin islandsedit  property damage on the island of saint croix  after passing southeast of puerto rico hurricane lenny struck st croix in the united states virgin islands although its strongest winds remained southeast of the island there gusts reached 112mph while sustained winds officially peaked around 70mph strong winds damaged the roofs of many houses in eastern st Croix1 and knocked down trees and power lines the winds left severe damage to vegetation after fruits and vegetables were blown away rainfall peaked at 10.47in which caused widespread flooding of many properties in the islands western portion in frederiksted the hurricane produced a storm surge of 1520ft along with high waves that washed out roads and damaged coastal structures there was also severe beach erosion in western st croix high waves dumped 6.5ft of sand onto coastal roads about 100ft inland,11 and also washed several boats ashore.1 the national weather service described the damage as  elsewhere in the us virgin islands lenny produced a storm surge of about 1.8ft in st Thomas.1 sustained winds on the island reached 53mph at the cyril e king airport with gusts to 70mph on nearby st john wind gusts reached 92mph rains were not as heavy as on st croix the maximum amounts were 4.34in on st thomas and 2.95in on st john both islands reported beach erosion along their southern coastlines.11 damage on st thomas was minimal limited to minor flooding and mudslides the virgin islands national park in st john reported over in damage in puerto rico and the us virgin islands the hurricane left about in damage but caused no deaths.1  in virgin gorda in the nearby british virgin islands the hurricane produced sustained winds of 55mph with gusts to 85mph rainfall amounted to around 4in and caused a mudslide near coxheath high waves eroded a portion of sir francis drake highway and the high winds destroyed the roof of an apartment.20 property damage in the british virgin islands totaled however the damage combined with the loss of tourism and productivity yielded a loss of to the islands economy or 3.1percent of the gross domestic product.33  lesser antillesedit  rainfall totals from lenny  the eye of lenny moved over anguilla an island located east of the british virgin Islands.1 localized flooding was reported,34 including in the capital the valley where waters reportedly reached a depth of 14ft the hurricane struck only a month after hurricane jose had affected the region causing significant beach erosion along anguillas coastline.36 damage from lenny amounted to  saint barthlemy and the sss islands which include saba sint eustatius and saint martin were in the path of hurricane lenny on November18 through 19.1 on saint barthlemy the hurricane produced record-breaking precipitation of around 15in waves reached 16ft on the islands western portion.1 on saba there was an unofficial wind gust of 167mph before the instrument blew away the island sustained damage to several buildings including airport facilities.1 the highest precipitation related to the storm occurred at the police station on the french side of saint martin where a total of 34.12in was recorded.31 this included a record 24-hour total of 18.98in on the dutch side of the island rainfall peaked at 27.56in in Philipsburg.1 the rains resulted in mudslides and flooding and were the primary form of impact on the island for 36hours, saint martin experienced tropical storm conditions and there were three times when the winds surpassed hurricane force sustained winds on the island peaked at 84mph at the princess juliana international Airport30 these were the highest sustained winds observed on land.1 the airport also reported a wind gust of 104mph  due to the hurricanes unusual track from the west it produced unparalleled waves of 1016ft along the western coast of st Martin,30 which damaged or destroyed many boats.1 during its passage lenny left widespread damage to the infrastructure including to the airport harbor resorts power utilities schools and hospitals.38 as a result the three sss islands sustained power and telephone outages.39 there was widespread destruction of the roofs of houses across the island,38 and over 200houses were destroyed.40 damage was estimated at and there were three deaths on the dutch side of st Martin.30 two of these deaths were from flying debris and the other was due to a collapsed roadway.1  while passing over antigua hurricane lenny dropped 18.32in of rain at the v c bird international airport while locations in the southern portion recorded over 25in the rainfall caused severe flooding in antigua resulting in landslides in the northwestern and southern portion of the island.28 flooding washed out major roadways including one bridge.41 along the coast the storm caused severe beach erosion about 65percent of barbuda experienced flooding due to the rainfall and the islands flat topography the flooding contaminated the water storage facilities and all private wells.28 about

western coastal highway leaving the most heavily traveled road temporarily closed.28 road closures cut off links between towns on the island.34 the hurricane destroyed at least 50homes,52 including 3 that were washed away by the waves.26 hotels along the islands west coast sustained heavy damage and across the nation the hurricanes impact was worse than that from hurricane luis four years prior.52 damage on the island totaled rainfall of around 3in reached as far south as martinique where one person was killed.31 further south high waves in saint lucia washed away beaches a seawall and coastal walkways.28 at least 40houses were damaged along the coast which left several families homeless.39 damage in the country totaled in saint vincent and the grenadines the hurricane washed away four buildings and damaged five others.34 about 50people were left homeless in the country.40  in western grenada high waves affected much of the coastline,28 destroying 21small boats and causing significant beach erosion.128 the waves covered the entire grand anse beach in saint george parish the erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened the foundation of the runway at the maurice bishop international airport storm damage cut off the towns in western grenada from the capital city of saint georges the cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage.28 in saint

pier in st croix  following heavy damage to the coral reef around curaao workers placed reef balls to assist in replenishing the damaged structure.54 in puerto rico workers quickly responded to power and water outages similarly on saint croix power systems were quickly restored.55 on November23, us president bill clinton declared the us virgin islands a disaster area this allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75percent of the cost of debris removal.56 by December10, nearly 3,000residents had applied for assistance mostly on st croix in response the federal government provided about to the affected people.57 the united states office of foreign disaster assistance provided mostly directed toward the united nations development programme for aid to other islands in the eastern caribbean other agencies including the caribbean development bank the united kingdoms department for international development and the european union provided in assistance.28  in response to the damage on saint martin officials in the netherlands antilles issued an appeal to the european parliament for assistance from the international community.38 due to their small population and area the small islands of the eastern caribbean required international funding to repair the damage from the hurricane and return to normal in antigua and barbuda officials worked quickly to repair roads and clean barbudas water system.28 however 20,000people in antigua remained without water for a week after the hurricane and the stagnant water caused an increase in mosquitoes.41 the government of dominica provided 42families with temporary shelters with a loan from the caribbean development bank the government worked to complete a sea wall along a highway south of its capital roseau the saint lucian government provided housing to 70families. in grenada workers repaired the road system to allow fuel transportation across the island and began to reclaim land near its airport to mitigate erosion.28 regions in antigua and grenada were declared disaster areas.4358 across the eastern caribbean local red cross offices provided food and shelter to affected citizens.52 high damage to tourist areas caused a decrease in cruise lines a damaged hotel in nevis left 800people unemployed due to its closure.59  due to its effects the name lenny was retired by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane.60 the name was replaced with lee in the 2005 atlantic hurricane season.61  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones
