desolate and lonely mind.3 musically the album is mainly rooted in electropop,456 alternative pop,7 and synth-pop,8 and features industrial undertones.4  productionedit  according to halsey badlands is a concept album that focuses on the fictional dystopian society known as the badlands the city is surrounded by a desert wasteland keeping the inhabitants of the badlands captive.9 the album was inspired by post-apocalyptic movies such as the fifth element after writing the first few songs halsey came to the realization that the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state halsey states that she created the badlands as an escape from her real life struggles in her opinion the metaphor was that even with no escape there is still optimism that there is somewhere else to go.9 the album was executive produced by Lido.10  singlesedit  was released as halseys debut single on october 27, 2014, with an accompanying music video filmed in tokyo which was directed by malia james and ryan

number five in the netherlands and number 10 in belgium flanders  in a review for pitchfork nathan reese wrote interviews with halsey you get the sense of a canny and talented performer one who legitimately wants to connect with fans but the public persona only comes through on badlands in fits and starts and there isnt a single subversive or original second on the album about the chorus on americana he commented most of badlands its calculated defiant and ultimately hollow.20 in a short review rolling stones joe levy called halsey a popstar with a knack for sticky imagery.21 the album was included at number six on rock sounds top 50 releases of 2015 list.27  track listingedit  badlands standard edition28  no  title  writers  producers  length  1.   ashley frangipane  peder losnegrd
