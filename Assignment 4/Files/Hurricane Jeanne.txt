extratropical cyclone over virginia on september 28 and the system moved back into the atlantic offshore the new jersey coast the next day.16  preparationsedit  puerto rico and the leeward islandsedit

opening shelters on saturday were distributed to the public and florida power and light warned that power could be out an extended period of time.21 canals were also drained on the same day.21  on friday the palm beach zoo prepared for the storm by moving small animals and birds into buildings such as restrooms and restaurants.22 evacuations began in earnest with many residents leaving for the keys noting that the islands were the only location definitely out of harms way for once evacuation to the keys made sense.23  the center of jeannes eye achieved landfall near stuart at virtually the identical spot that frances had come ashore three weeks earlier the first time in record keeping that a hurricane made landfall in the same place as a previous storm of the same season maximum winds
