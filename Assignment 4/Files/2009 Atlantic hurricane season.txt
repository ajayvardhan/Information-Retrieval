cyclone season  atlantic hurricane seasons  2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011  the 2009 atlantic hurricane season was a below-average atlantic hurricane season that produced eleven tropical cyclones nine named storms three hurricanes and two major hurricanes.1nb 1 it officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the atlantic basin.3 the seasons first tropical cyclone tropical depression one developed on May28,4 while the final storm hurricane ida dissipated on November10.5 the most intense hurricane bill was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that affected areas from the leeward islands to Newfoundland.6 the season featured the lowest number of tropical cyclones since the 1997 season and only one system claudette made landfall in the united states forming from the interaction of a tropical wave and an upper level low claudette made landfall on the florida panhandle with maximum sustained winds of 45mph before quickly dissipating over alabama the storm killed two people and caused usd in damage  pre-season forecasts issued by colorado state university called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane statusnb 2 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration later issued its initial forecast which predicted nine to fourteen named storms four to seven hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes after several revisions in the projected number of named storms both agencies lowered their forecasts by the middle of the season  several storms made landfall or directly affected land outside of the united states tropical storm ana brought substantial rainfall totals to many of the caribbean islands including puerto rico which led to minor street flooding hurricane bill delivered gusty winds and rain to the island of newfoundland while tropical storm danny affected the us state of north carolina and erika affected the lesser antilles as a poorly organized tropical system hurricane fred affected the cape verde islands as a developing tropical cyclone and tropical storm grace briefly impacted the azores becoming the farthest northeast forming storm on record the seasons final storm ida affected portions of central america before bringing significant rainfall to the southeast united states

claudette on August16  during the 2009 season nine of the eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall the united states experienced one of its quietest years with no hurricanes making landfall in the country throughout the basin six people were killed in tropical cyclone-related incidents and total losses reached roughly most of the damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout the east coast of the united states in the united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly in damage in the lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in the atlantic the azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants.1 in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly in losses.14 the hurricane also produced tropical storm-force winds in Bermuda.6 hurricane fred briefly impacted the southern cape verde islands as it bypassed the islands early in its existence.15 the azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace however both areas recorded only minor effects.16  overall the seasons activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy rating of 53, the lowest since 1997.17 due to the low number of storms in the 2009 season many of which were short-lived the overall ace value was ranked as below-average totaling under 66.18 hurricane bill was responsible for the ace value for august being 30 above average.19 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots 63kmh or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.20  systemsedit  tropical depression oneedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  May28 May29  peak intensity  35mph 1006mbarhPa  main article tropical depression one  during mid-may a frontal boundary stalled near the bahamas and slowly degenerated on May25, 2009, an area of low pressure developed along the tail-end of a decaying cold front near the northern bahamas tracking northward this low gradually developed as it moved within 85mi of north carolinas outer banks by May28, deep convection developed across a small area over the low pressure system leading to the national hurricane center classifying the system as tropical depression one the depression moved over the warm waters of the gulf stream for the following 24hours, allowing it to maintain its convection before moving into a hostile environment characterized by strong wind shear and cooler waters late on May29, the system degenerated into a remnant low several hours later on May30, about 345mi south-southeast of halifax nova scotia tropical depression one was absorbed by a warm front.4  as a tropical cyclone the depression had no impact on land however the precursor to the system brought scattered rainfall and increased winds to parts of the north carolina coastline but no damage.4 upon becoming a tropical depression on May28, tropical depression one became the northernmost forming may tropical cyclone in atlantic history though subtropical cyclones formed equally far north in 1972 and 2007. it also marked the third consecutive year with pre-season tropical or subtropical cyclones in the basin.421  tropical storm anaedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  August11 August16  peak intensity  40mph 1003mbarhPa  main article tropical storm ana  ana formed out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on August11, ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on August12 before weakening back to a depression the following day the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward on August14, the depression regenerated roughly 1,075mi east of the leeward islands early on August15, the storm re-attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40mph and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar 29.65inHg, the storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and the unusually fast movement of ana in post-storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on August16, before reaching any landmasses.22  numerous tropical storm watches were issued for the lesser antilles puerto rico and the dominican republic between August15 and 17.22 several islands took minor precautions for the storm including st croix which evacuated 40residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm.23 in the dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters.24 impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall.22 in puerto rico up to 2.76in causing street flooding and forcing the evacuation of three schools high winds associated with the storm also downed trees and power lines leaving roughly 6,000 residents without power.26  hurricane billedit  category 4hurricaneSSHWS  duration  August15 August24  peak intensity

and the lesser antilles eventually the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a Category4 storm roughly 345mi east-northeast of the leeward islands the storm attained maximum winds of 130mph the highest of any storm during the season before weakening slightly as it turned north the large storm passed roughly 175mi west of bermuda as a Category2 hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed the southern coast of nova scotia the following day shortly before making landfall in newfoundland bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated the storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over the north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non-tropical low on August24.6  two people were killed by the storms large swellsone in maine and another in florida the hurricane came close enough to warrant tropical cyclone watches and warnings in both the us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on August16.6 large life-threatening swells produced by the storm impacted north-facing coastlines of puerto rico and hispaniola as hurricane bill approached Bermuda.27 along the coasts of north carolina waves averaging 10ft in height impacted beaches on long island beach damage was severe in some areas the damage was worse than hurricane gloria in 1985.28 in new york severe beach erosion caused by the storm resulted in over in

of hurricane bill the seasons third named storm developed on August16. forming out of a tropical wave and an upper-level low pressure system claudette quickly intensified into a tropical storm offshore south of tallahassee florida by the afternoon the storm had attained winds of 60mph and steadily tracked towards the florida panhandle early on August17, the center of claudette made landfall on santa rosa island several hours after landfall the storm weakened to a tropical depression and the hydrometeorological prediction center took over primary responsibility of the storm the system quickly dissipated and was last noted over alabama on August18.30  the national hurricane center issued tropical storm warnings for the florida coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuate storm-surge-prone areas.3031 tropical storm claudette produced moderate rainfall across portions of florida georgia and alabama between August16 and 18. two people were killed offshore amidst rough seas from the storm.32 an EF-0 tornado spawned by the storm in cape coral damaged 11 homes leaving in damages additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to as a result of Claudette.33  tropical storm dannyedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  August26 August29  peak intensity  60mph 1006mbarhPa  main article tropical storm danny  around the same time the remnants of hurricane bill dissipated over the northern Atlantic,6 a new tropical storm developed near the bahamas on August26. the system immediately declared tropical storm danny on its first advisory erratically moved in a general northwestward direction danny attained peak winds of 60mph before succumbing to high wind shear after turning northward the storm weakened and was eventually absorbed by another low pressure system off the east coast of the united states early on August29.34 high waves from danny killed a boy in the outer Banks.35  tropical storm erikaedit  tropical stormsshws

antilles upon forming the storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph persistent wind shear prevented the system from intensifying and resulted in the storms convection being completely displaced from the center of circulation by the time it passed over guadeloupe on September2. after entering the caribbean sea erika briefly regained strength before fully succumbing to strong shear the system eventually dissipated on September4, to the south of puerto Rico.36 damages were minor though one island received several inches of rain  hurricane frededit  category 3hurricaneSSHWS

islands on September7. this depression rapidly intensified within an environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures receiving the name fred on September8, the storm quickly developed an eye feature and was upgraded to a hurricane roughly 24hours after being named within a 12hour span the storms winds increased by 40mph to its peak of 120mph upon reaching this intensity fred became the strongest storm on record south of 30N and east of 35W in the atlantic basin not long after the intensification ceased it began to weaken as dry air became entrained within the system by September11, the storm nearly stalled northwest of the cape verde islands and weakened to a tropical storm the following day fred degenerated into a remnant low before taking a westward track across the atlantic the remnants of fred persisted for nearly a week nearly regenerating into a tropical depression several times the low eventually dissipated on September19, to the south of Bermuda.15  tropical depression eightedit  tropical depressionsshws  duration  September25 September26  peak intensity  35mph 1008mbarhPa  in late september a new well-defined tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa into the atlantic ocean by September25, the system had developed sufficient deep convection for the nhc to classify it as tropical depression eight at this time the depression attained its peak intensity with winds of 35mph and a minimum pressure of 1008mbar shortly thereafter wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the depression to weaken the system degenerated into a remnant low on September26 before degenerating into a trough of low pressure.37  tropical storm graceedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  october 4 october 6  peak intensity  65mph 986mbarhPa  main article tropical storm grace  originating from an extratropical cyclone east of newfoundland on September27, the precursor to tropical storm grace tracked southeastward towards the azores gaining subtropical characteristics after executing a counterclockwise loop between October1 and 3, deep convection wrapped around a small circulation center that had developed within the larger cyclone on October4, this smaller low developed into a tropical storm while situated near the azores islands becoming the northeastern-most forming atlantic tropical cyclone on record the storm quickly turned northeastward and intensified developing an eye-like feature as it attained peak winds of 65mph and a minimum pressure of 986mbar 29.11inHg. it weakened over increasingly colder waters and began merging with an approaching frontal boundary early on October6, grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating later that day near Wales.16  although grace passed through the azores islands the storm had little known effects there.16 in europe the system and its remnants brought rain to several countries including Portugal,38 the united Kingdom39 and Belgium.40 no fatalities were linked to grace and overall damage was minimal.16  tropical storm henriedit  tropical stormsshws  duration  October6 October8  peak intensity  50mph 1005mbarhPa  a tropical wave left

thunderstorms were displaced east of the center of circulation and the probability for development was never high the disturbance became a tropical depression around 0000 utc on october 6 about 775mi east of the lesser Antilles.41 operationally the storm was not designated a tropical cyclone until later on October6, when it was immediately declared a tropical storm.44  affected by strong wind shear henri remained disorganized with its center located on the western edge of the convection moving northwestward henri intensified slightly to peak winds of 50mph on October7 after the convection increased shortly thereafter the wind shear grew stronger and on October8 the storm weakened to a tropical depression.41 the structure became further disorganized with several low-level vortices.45 just twelve hours after weakening into a depression henri degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure the remnants continued northwestward before turning to the west-southwest due to a ridge on

quickly developed into tropical storm ida within a favorable environment as it neared the coastline of nicaragua several hours before moving over land ida attained hurricane-status with winds reaching 80mph hours after moving inland ida weakened to a tropical storm and further to a tropical depression as it turned northward on November7, the depression re-entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified early on November8, the system re-attained hurricane intensity as it rapidly intensified over warm waters ida attained its peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane early the next day with winds of 105mph as it moved over the yucatn channel not long after reaching this intensity ida quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the gulf of mexico despite strong wind shear the storm briefly re-attained hurricane status for a third time near the southeastern louisiana coastline before quickly weakening to a tropical storm shortly before moving inland over the southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ida persisted until November11, at which time the low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided energy for another system which became a powerful noreaster causing significant damage in the mid-atlantic states the resulting storm came to be known as NorIda.5  in the southern caribbean hurricane ida caused roughly in damage in nicaragua after destroying numerous homes and leaving an estimated 40,000 people homeless.4647 ida also produced significant rainfall across portions of western cuba with some areas recording up to 12.5in of rain during the storms passage.5 in the united states the hurricane and the subsequent noreaster caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic States.5 one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others were killed in various incidents related to the noreaster overall the two systems caused nearly in damage throughout the country.33  storm namesedit  the
