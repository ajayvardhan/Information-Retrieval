america but they spoke an unrelated language known as island carib  at the time of spanish contact the caribs were one of the dominant groups in the caribbean which owes its name to them they lived throughout the windward islands dominica and possibly the southern leeward islands historically it was thought their ancestors were mainland caribs known as the igneri the igneri had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants however linguistic and archaeological evidence disputes the notion of a mass emigration and conquest the island carib language appears not to have been cariban but arawakan like that of their neighbors the tano irving rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a south american origin.3  in the early colonial period the caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands it was claimed that they practiced cannibalism the word derives from a corruption of their name.4 according to the spanish conquistadores the carib indians were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh archaeological evidence indicates that they limited the consumption of humans to ceremonial occasions there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both carib and other amerindian groups such as the arawak and tupinamba today the caribs and their descendants continue to live in the antilles the garifuna or black caribs a group of

communities none of the insular amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland the caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors they appeared to have owed their dominance in the caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare  according to floyd question arose in columbuss time whether indians could be enslaved and queen isabel had ruled against it at about the same time however ojeda bastidas and other explorers voyaging along the spanish main had been attacked by indians with poisoned arrows all such indians were considered caribs which took a considerable toll of spanish lives these attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators at least were cannibals provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of caribs on 3 june 1511, king ferdinand declared war on the Caribs.6 island caribs nevertheless mostly succeeded in keeping their islands unoccupied by spaniards  in the 17th century island caribs were displaced with a great loss of life by a new wave of european invaders french and english most fatalities resulted from eurasian infectious diseases such as smallpox which they had no natural immunity to as well as warfare  in 1660, france and england signed with island caribs the treaty of saint charles that stipulated that caribs would evacuate all the lesser antilles except for dominica and saint vincent which were recognized as reserves however the english would later ignore the treaty and ended up annexing both islands in 1763.7 to this date a small population of around 3,000 caribs survives in the carib territory in

roatan island off honduras their descendants continue to live there today and are known as the garifuna ethnic group carib resistance delayed the settlement of dominica by europeans the black carib communities that remained in st vincent and dominica retained a degree of autonomy well into the 19th century  the last known speakers of island carib died in the 1930s, and the language is extinct

emphasis placed on training for warfare their skin was of a brown hue and they were usually naked and it was very rare for their loins to be covered the women painted their skin with a red dye called roucou which they used to make fantastical decorations of many colours the eyes of the females were usually circled with black the men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses jewellery through their lips and jewellery through their noses they wore the caracoli which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended the caracoli was worn to represent the courage of the wearer  religionedit  the caribs are believed to have been polytheists as the spanish began to colonise the caribbean area they wanted to convert the natives to Catholicism.12  the religion practised by the caribs had elements similar to the ancestor worship of the tano they believed in an evil spirit called maybouya who had to be placated for an individual to avoid harm the chief function of their shamans called buyeis was to heal the sick with herbs and to cast spells which would keep maybouya at bay the buyeis were very important and underwent special training instead of becoming warriors as they were held to be the only people who could avert evil they were treated with great respect their ceremonies were accompanied with sacrifices as with the arawaks and other native americans the caribs smoked tobacco in the rituals of their religion  social organizationedit  early carib culture was patriarchal women carried out the domestic duties of rearing young children processing and producing food and clothing and cultivating the land for farming including sowing and harvesting men carried

houses from men a custom recorded among other south american tribescitation needed  the women were highly revered and held substantial socio-political power.13 island carib society was reputedly more socially egalitarian than tano society although there were village chiefs and war leaders there were no large states or multi-tiered aristocracy the local self-government unit may have been the longhouse dwellings populated by men or women typically run by one or more chieftains reporting to an island council  foodedit  the caribs ate almost the same foods as the tainos they did not farm very well so they relied less on maize and cassava but still knew how to grow them although they were not very good farmers the caribs were excellent fishermen and were not afraid of long voyages their diet consisted of lots of protein they ate manatees ducks iguanas and fish among other foods the caribs had many myths and beliefs about diet they believed that eating pig would give one small beady eyes they also believed eating turtle meat made one stupid.14 in doing so they deprived themselves of the protein that was easily available in the west indies they also believed that eating crab before a voyage would bring storms the caribs seasoned their food with pepper but did not use salt couii and taumalin were pepper sauces taumalin was made from pepper lemon juice and the green meat of crab the caribs made ouicou a cassava beer with a strong alcoholic content and got very drunk on festivals and holidays although their diet was not quite so varied as that of the arawaks it was well balanced prepared in many different ways and served with different seasonings.14  musicedit  this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable

s stuart  the island carib word karibna meant it became the origin of the english although among the caribs it was apparently associated with rituals related to the eating of war enemies there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both arawak and other amerindian groups such as the carib and tupinamba  the caribs had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses missionaries such as pre jean baptiste labat and cesar de rochefort described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants the caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribes  italian explorer giovanni da verrazzano was killed and said to have been eaten by carib natives on what is now guadeloupe west indies in 1528 called karukera by the amerindian people which means the island of beautiful waters
