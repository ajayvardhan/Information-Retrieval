used by the indigenous native Americans,13 or possibly from the spanish baja mar water or sea or tide reflecting the shallow waters of the area alternatively it may originate from guanahani a local name of unclear meaning.14  a peculiarity of the name is that the word the is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is therefore capitalised so in contrast to congo and united kingdom it is proper

nia and the pinta on watling island an island of the bahamas that the natives called guanahani and that he named san salvador on 12 october 1492.15  taino people moved into the uninhabited southern bahamas from hispaniola and cuba around the 11th century having migrated there from south america they came to be known as the lucayan people an estimated 30,000 lucayan inhabited the bahamas at the time of christopher columbus arrival in 1492.  columbuss first landfall in the new world was on an island he named san salvador to the lucayan as guanahani some researchers believe this site to be present-day san salvador island known as watlings island situated in the southeastern bahamas an alternative theory holds that columbus landed to the southeast on samana cay according to calculations made in 1986 by national geographic writer and editor joseph judge based on columbuss log evidence in support of this remains inconclusive on the landfall island columbus made first contact with the lucayan and exchanged goods with them  the spanish forced much of the lucayan population to hispaniola for use as forced labour the slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity half of the taino died from smallpox alone.16 the population of the bahamas was severely diminished.17  in 1648, the eleutherian adventurers led by william sayle migrated from bermuda these english puritans established the first permanent european settlement on an island which they named eleutherathe name derives from the greek word for freedom they later settled new providence naming it sayles island after one of their leaders to survive the settlers salvaged goods from wrecks  in 1670, king charles ii granted the islands to the lords proprietors of the carolinas in north america they rented the islands from the king with rights of trading tax appointing governors and administering the country.18 in 1684 spanish corsair juan de alcon raided the

including the infamous blackbeard 16801718. to put an end to the republic and restore orderly government britain made the bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of woodes rogers after a difficult struggle he succeeded in suppressing piracy.19 in 1720, rogers led local militia to drive off a spanish attack  during the american war of independence in the late 18th century the islands became a target for american naval forces under the command of commodore esek hopkins us marines occupied the capital of nassau for a fortnight  in 1782, following the british defeat at yorktown a spanish fleet appeared off the coast of nassau the city surrendered without a fight spain returned possession of the bahamas to britain the following year under the terms of the treaty of paris before the news was received however the islands were recaptured by a small british force led by andrew deveaux  after american independence the british resettled some 7,300 loyalists with their slaves in the bahamas and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent these loyalists who included deveaux established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital european americans were outnumbered by the african-american slaves they brought with them and ethnic europeans remained a minority in the territory  in 1807, the british abolished the slave trade followed by the united states the next year during the following decades the royal navy intercepted the trade they resettled in the bahamas thousands of africans liberated from slave ships  in the 1820s during the period of the seminole wars in florida hundreds of american slaves and african seminoles escaped from cape florida to the bahamas they settled mostly on northwest andros island where they developed the village of red bays from eyewitness accounts 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by bahamians in 27 sloops with others using canoes for the journey this was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at bill baggs cape florida state Park.2021 some of their descendants in red bays continue african seminole traditions in basket making and grave

development to identify red bays as a site related to american slaves search for freedom the museum has researched and documented the african seminoles escape from southern florida it plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in red bay associated with the period of their settlement in the Bahamas.23  in 1818,24 the home office in london had ruled that slave brought to the bahamas from outside the british west indies would be manumitted this led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by us nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.25 the american slave ships comet and encomium used in the united states domestic coastwise slave trade were wrecked off abaco island in december 1830 and february 1834, respectively when wreckers took the masters passengers and slaves into nassau customs officers seized the slaves and british colonial officials freed them over the protests of the americans there were 165 slaves on the comet and 48 on the encomium britain finally paid an indemnity to the united states in those two cases in 1855, under the treaty of claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two nations.2627  slavery was abolished in the british empire on 1 august 1834. after that british colonial officials freed 78 american slaves from the enterprise which went into bermuda in 1835 and 38 from the hermosa which wrecked off abaco island in 1840.28 the most notable case was that of the creole in 1841 as a result of a slave revolt on board the leaders ordered the american brig to nassau it was carrying 135 slaves from virginia destined for sale in new orleans the bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands the creole case has been described as the successful slave revolt in us history.29  these incidents in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to us nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the united states and great britain they had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade but worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value the united states argued that britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade the united states worried that the success of the creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships  20th centuryedit  edward viii the duke of windsor and governor of the bahamas from 1940 to 1945  in august 1940, after his abdication of the british throne the duke of windsor was

forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight thus the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands then at about 80 ma the area became flooded by the gulf stream this resulted in the drowning of the blake plateau the separation of the bahamas from cuba and florida the separation of the southeastern bahamas into separate banks the

these atolls within which oolites and pellets form.50  coral growth was greater through the tertiary until the start of the ice ages and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m in

descent and numbers about 80,000. due to an extremely high immigration of haitians to the bahamas the bahamian government started deporting illegal haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.63  the white bahamian population are mainly the descendants of the english puritans looking to flee religious persecution in england and american loyalists escaping the american revolution who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively.64 many southern loyalists went to the abaco islands half of whose population was of european descent as of 1985.65 the term white is usually used to identify bahamians with anglo ancestry as well as afro-bahamians sometimes bahamians use the term conchy joe to describe people of anglo descent.66  a small portion of the euro-bahamian population is descended from greek labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. they make up less than 1 of the nations population but have still preserved their distinct greek bahamian culturecitation needed  bahamians typically identify themselves simply as either black or white.66  languagesedit  the official language of the bahamas is english many haitians who migrated to the bahamas speak an english-based creole language bahamian dialect simply as or as is a variety of broken english by bahamian diasporas james catalyn a bahamian writer and actor was the first to coin the latter name in a poem and has since promoted its usage.6869 both are used as autoglossonyms.70 haitian creole a french-based creole language is spoken by haitians and their descendants who make up of about 25 of the total population it is known simply as Creole1 to differentiate languages.71Also note that the bahamas was once under british rule and therefore the english taught in the bahamian schools is still  religionedit  further information religion in the bahamas  according to international religious freedom report 2008 prepared by united states bureau of democracy human rights and labor the islands
