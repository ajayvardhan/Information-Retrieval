greenhouse effect and other environmental issues the center stored information essential to industry agriculture science hydrology transportation recreation and engineering these services are still provided by the ncei  the ncdc stated  evidence is mounting that global climate is changing the extent to which man is responsible is still under study regardless of the causes it is essential that a baseline of long-term climate data be compiled therefore global data must be acquired quality controlled and archived working with international institutions such as the international council of scientific unions the world data centers and the world meteorological organization ncdc develops standards by which data can be exchanged and made accessible  ncdc provides the historical perspective on climate through the use of over a hundred years of weather observations reference data bases are generated from this knowledge the clientele of ncdc can learn from the past to prepare for a better tomorrow wise use of our most valuable natural resource climate is the goal of climate researchers state and regional climate centers business and commerce.6  associated entitiesedit  ncdc also maintained world data center for meteorology asheville the four world centers russia japan and china have created a free and open situation in which data and dialogue are exchanged  ncdc maintained
