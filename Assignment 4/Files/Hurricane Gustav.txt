history of hurricane gustav  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  gustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the lesser antilles it developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature the nhc designated it tropical depression seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system.8 at the time the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant,89 and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm which was soon designated tropical storm Gustav.10 a brief period of disorganization11 proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night.12 in the early hours of august 26, as the storm approached haitis southwestern peninsula,13 another hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspectedthat gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90mph before reaching haiti its satellite presentation continued to intensify a central dense overcast became more prominent,15 and the minimum central pressure fell.16  hurricane gustav making landfall in haiti on august 25  hurricane gustav regained a pronounced eye as it made landfall on haiti with 75mph winds,17 near the town of Jacmel.18 as the hurricane moved over haitis mountainous terrain its circulation was disrupted17 and it lost a little strength.19 although downgraded to a tropical storm it still had a pronounced eye in its mid- and upper-level structures its outflow improved throughout the night of august 26,20 and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the gulf of Gonve.21 however the storms movement slowed and continued interaction with nearby haiti combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast resulted in further weakening during the day on august 27.2223 the storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to jamaica on the morning of august 28 it was found that overnight gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought the storm was also found to have restrengthened nearly to hurricane status.24 it then was upgraded to a hurricane again during the late afternoon of august 29. at 1100 am edt on august 30, as gustav neared the west end of cuba it was upgraded to a Category3 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane Scale,25 with sustained winds near 125mph gustav

strength passing over a shortened loop current with sustained winds at 115mph.30 on the evening of august 31, gustav weakened to a category 2 hurricane and remained at such intensity until landfall.4 gustav made landfall along the louisiana coast with 105mph winds near Cocodrie,31 at about 930 am cdt by 10pm cdt gustav had been downgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 60mph about 20miles
