challenged and removed 2009 how and when to remove this template message  the triskelion appearing on the isle of man flag has rotational symmetry because it appears the same when rotated by one third of a full turn about its center because its appearance is identical in three distinct orientations its rotational symmetry is three-fold  rotational symmetry also known as radial symmetry in biology is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn an objects degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks the same  contents  1 formal treatment  1.1 discrete rotational symmetry  1.2 examples  1.3 multiple symmetry axes through the same point  1.4 rotational symmetry with respect to any angle  1.5 rotational symmetry with translational symmetry  2 see also  3 references  4 external links  formal treatmentedit  see also rotational invariance  formally the rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in m-dimensional euclidean space rotations are direct isometries ie isometries preserving orientation therefore a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of em euclidean group  symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations so space is homogeneous and the symmetry group is the whole em with the modified notion of symmetry for vector fields the symmetry group can also be em  for symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin these rotations form the special orthogonal group som the group of mm orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. for m 3 this is the rotation group SO3.  in another meaning of the word the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within en the group of direct isometries in other words the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries for chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group  laws of physics are SO3-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space because of noethers theorem rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law  discrete rotational symmetryedit  rotational symmetry of ordern also called n-fold rotational symmetry or discrete rotational symmetry of the nth order with respect to a particular point 2D or axis 3D means that rotation by an angle of 360n 120, 90, 72, 60, 5137, etc does not change the object note that symmetry is no symmetry objects look alike after a rotation of 360.  the notation for n-fold symmetry is cn or simply the actual symmetry group is specified by the point or axis of symmetry together with the n for each point or axis of symmetry the abstract group type is cyclic group of ordern zn although for the latter also the notation cn is used the geometric and abstract cn should be distinguished there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different see cyclic symmetry groups in 3D.  the fundamental domain is a sector of 360n.  examples without additional reflection symmetry  n 2, 180 the dyad among the quadrilaterals the parallelograms which have this as a fully identifying and sufficient feature letters z n s the outlines albeit not the colors of the yin and yang symbol the union flag divided

symmetry with respect to an angle of 100, then also with respect to one of 20, the greatest common divisor of 100 and 360.  a typical 3D object with rotational symmetry also with perpendicular axes but no mirror symmetry is a propeller  examplesedit  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  double pendulum fractal  roundabout traffic sign  decorative hindu form  us bicentennial star  crop circle in perspective  the

point there are the following possibilities  in addition to an n-fold axis n perpendicular 2-fold axes the dihedral groups dn of order2n 2. this is the rotation group of a regular prism or regular bipyramid although the same notation is used the geometric and abstract dn should be distinguished there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different see dihedral symmetry groups in 3D.  43-fold and 32-fold axes the rotation group t of order12 of a regular tetrahedron the group is isomorphic to alternating group A4.  34-fold, 43-fold, and 62-fold axes the rotation groupo of order24 of a cube and a regular octahedron the group is isomorphic to symmetric group S4.  65-fold, 103-fold, and 152-fold axes the rotation groupi of order60 of a dodecahedron and an icosahedron the group is isomorphic to alternating groupA5. the group contains 10 versions of D3 and 6 versions of D5 symmetries like prisms and antiprisms  in the case of the platonic solids the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges and the number of them is half the number of edges the other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces except in the case of the tetrahedron where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face  rotational symmetry with respect to any angleedit  rotational symmetry with respect to any angle is in two dimensions circular symmetry the fundamental domain is a half-line  in three dimensions we can distinguish cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry change when rotating about one axis or for any rotation that is no dependence on the angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates the fundamental domain is a half-plane through the axis and a radial half-line respectively axisymmetric or axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry or axisymmetry an example of approximate spherical symmetry is the earth respect to density and other physical and chemical properties  in 4D, continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2D rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane about the point of intersection an object can also have rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes eg if it is the cartesian product of two rotationally symmetry 2D figures as in the case of eg the duocylinder and various regular duoprisms  rotational symmetry with translational symmetryedit  arrangement within a primitive cell of 2- and 4-fold rotocenters a fundamental domain is indicated in yellow  arrangement within a primitive cell of 2-, 3-, and 6-fold rotocenters alone or in combination the 6-fold symbol as a combination of a 2- and a 3-fold symbol in the case of 2-fold symmetry only the shape of the parallelogram can be different for the case p6, a fundamental domain is indicated in yellow  2-fold rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the frieze groups there are two rotocenters per primitive cell  together with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the following wallpaper groups with axes per primitive cell  p2 42-fold rotation group of a parallelogrammic rectangular and rhombic lattice  p3 33-fold not the rotation group of any lattice lattice is upside-down the same but that does not apply for this symmetry it is eg the rotation group of the regular triangular tiling with the equilateral triangles alternatingly colored  p4 24-fold, 22-fold rotation group of a square lattice  p6 16-fold, 23-fold, 32-fold rotation group of a hexagonal lattice  2-fold rotocenters possible 4-fold and 6-fold, if present at all form the translate of a lattice equal to the translational lattice scaled by a factor 12. in the case translational symmetry in one dimension a similar property applies though the term does not apply  3-fold rotocenters possible 6-fold, if present at all form a regular hexagonal lattice equal to the translational lattice rotated by 30 equivalently 90, and scaled by a factor  4-fold rotocenters if present at all form a regular square lattice equal to the translational lattice rotated by 45, and scaled by a factor  6-fold rotocenters if present at all form a regular hexagonal lattice which is the translate of the translational lattice  scaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor therefore the number of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold, etc  3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one ditto in 3D with respect to parallel axes implies rotation group p6, ie double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point in 3D, parallel axis the translation distance for the symmetry generated by one such pair of rotocenters is 23 times their distance
