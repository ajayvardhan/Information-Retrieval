hattie was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1961 atlantic hurricane season reaching a peak intensity equivalent to that of a Category5hurricane. the ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern caribbean sea on October27. moving generally northward the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day hattie then turned westward west of jamaica and strengthened into a Category5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160mph it weakened to Category4 before making landfall south of belize city on October31. the storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of central america dissipating on November1.  hattie first affected the southwestern caribbean where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on san andres island it was initially forecast to continue north and strike cuba prompting evacuations on the island while turning west hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to 11.5in on grand cayman the country of belize at the time known as british honduras sustained the worst damage from the hurricanenb 1 the former capital belize city was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge the territory governor estimated that 70of the buildings in the city had been damaged leaving more than 10,000people homeless the destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city belmopan overall hattie caused about in lossesnb 2 and 307deaths in the territory although damage was heavier in hattie than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000people, the death toll from hattie was less due to advance warnings elsewhere in central america hattie killed 11people in guatemala and one in honduras  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  3.1 british honduras  4 aftermath  5 see also  6 notes  7 references  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  for several days toward the end of october 1961, a low-pressure area persisted in the western caribbean sea north of the panama canal Zone.2 on October25, an upper-level anticyclone moved over the low the next day a trough over the western gulf of mexico provided favorable outflow for the disturbance at 0000UTC on October27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46mph later that day the airport on san andres island reported easterly winds of 60mph the two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation centered about 70miles southeast of san andres or 155mi east of the nicaraguan coast as a result the miami weather bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed tropical storm Hattie.3  after being classified hattie moved steadily northward passing very near or over san andres island a station on the island recorded a pressure of 991mbar and sustained winds of 80mph which indicated that hattie had reached hurricane status.3 late on October28, a hurricane hunters flight encountered a much stronger hurricane with winds of 125mph in a small area near the center at the time gale-force winds extended outward 140mi to the northeast and 70miles to the southwest.2 early on October29, a trough extending from nicaragua to florida was expected to allow hattie to continue northward based on climatology for similar hurricanes.3 later that day hattie was forecast to be an imminent threat to the cayman islands and western Cuba.2 around that time a strengthening ridge to the north turned the hurricane northwestward which spared the greater antilles but increased the threat to central America.3  with the strengthening ridge to its north hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24hours.34 initially forecasters at the miami weather bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again late on October29, the center of the hurricane passed about 90miles southwest of grand cayman at which time the interaction between hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around 30mph across florida early on October30, the hurricane hunters confirmed the increase in intensity reporting winds of 140mph the storms minimum central pressure continued to drop throughout the day reaching 924mbar by 1300UTC a lower pressure of 920mbar was computed at 1700UTC that day based on a flight-level reading from the hurricane Hunters.3 hattie later curved toward the west-southwest passing between the cayman islands and the swan islands late on October30, hattie attained peak winds of 160mph about 190mi east of the border of mexico and british honduras this made hattie the equivalence of a Category5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a reanalysis of the 1932season revealed that hurricane fourteen had a similar intensity on november 5, six days after Hattie.4 additionally hattie was the strongest october hurricane in the northwest caribbean until hurricane mitch in 1998.5  hattie maintained much of its intensity as it continued toward the coast of british honduras after moving through several small islands offshore the hurricane made landfall a short distance south of belize city on October31, with an eyewall of about 25miles in diameter.3 based on a post-season analysis it was determined that hattie had weakened to winds of 140mph before moving ashore.4 the hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land dissipating on November1 as it moved into the mountains of guatemala during its dissipation tropical storm simone was developing off the pacific coast of Guatemala.34 there was speculation that hattie contributed to the development of simone and later tropical storm inga after the remnants of simone merged with nearby disturbed weather.6  preparationsedit  upon initiating advisories on hattie the miami weather bureau noted the potential for heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the southwestern caribbean the advisories recommended for small ships to remain at harbor across the region.2 initially the hurricane was predicted to move near or through the cayman islands jamaica and Cuba.3 as a result cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.7  hurricane hattie first posed a threat to the yucatn peninsula and british honduras on October30 when it turned toward the area.2 officials at the miami weather bureau warned of the potential for high tides strong winds and torrential rainfall the warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas.2 most people in the capital belize city were evacuated or moved to shelters,3 and a school was operated as a refuge.8 a hospital in the city was evacuated,9 and over 75 of the population of stann creek fled to safer locations.3 after hattie made landfall officials in mexico ordered the closure of ports along the isthmus of Tehuantepec.9  impactedit  map of british honduras showing hurricane damage  despite predictions for heavy rainfall in the southwestern caribbean the hurricanes movement was more northerly than expected resulting in less precipitation along the central american coast than anticipated.2 in its early developmental stages hattie struck san andrs island located offshore eastern nicaragua with maximum sustained winds of 80mph and gusts of 104mph as the hurricane neared the island the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds.3 rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels many palm tree plantations were devastated the schooner admirar anchored in one of the islands bays capsized during the storm.10 overall hattie resulted in one death fifteen injuries and in damage in san andrs the hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island and of the four was the only to approach from the south.3  in the northwestern caribbean hattie passed close to grand cayman with heavy rainfall at least 11.5inches of rain were reported on the island including 7.8inches in six hours.2 winds on grand cayman were below hurricane force and only minor damage occurred due to the rain.2  the interaction between hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of 20mph across most of florida with a gust of 72mph reported at hillsboro inlet light the winds caused some beach erosion in the state.2 the us weather bureau issued a small craft warning for the west and east florida coastlines as well as northward to brunswick Georgia.11  later hattie impacted various countries in central america with flash floods causing 11deaths in guatemala and one fatality in Honduras.3 the swan islands reported wind gusts just below hurricane force resulting in minor damage and one injury.2  british hondurasedit  hurricane hattie moved ashore in british honduras with a storm tide of up to 14feet near belize City,3 a city of 31,000people located at sea-level its only defenses against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands.12 the capital experienced high waves and a 10ft storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings a trained observer estimated winds of over 150mph and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200mph when hattie affected the area most buildings in belize city were wooden and most of this type were destroyed.9 offshore the hurricane heavily damaged 80 of the belize barrier reef although the reef recovered after the storm  high winds caused a power outage,12 downed trees across the region and destroyed the roofs of many buildings.14 governor colin thornley estimated that over 70of the buildings in the territory were damaged and more than 10,000people were left homeless.9 some shelters set up before the storm were destroyed in the hurricane.2 the hurricane destroyed the wall at an insane asylum which allowed the residents to escape.14 high waves damaged a prison,15 prompting officials to institute a parole program for the inmates.14 hattie also flooded the government house washing away all records.15 all of belize city was coated in a layer of mud and debris,14 and majority of the city was destroyed or severely damaged as was nearby stann Creek.3 the hurricane left significant crop damage across the region including in citrus fruits and similar losses to timber cocoa and bananas.3 the years production of sugar cane was also heavily damaged about 70of the territorys mahogany trees were downed as were most citrus and grapefruit trees the hurricane damaged several factories and oil rigs in the region.16 damage throughout the territory totaled and a total of 307deaths were reported17 more than 100of the fatalities were in belize City,2 including 36 who evacuated to a british administration building that was later destroyed in the storm.18 the government of british honduras considered hurricane hattie more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000people the lower death toll of hattie was due to advance warning.3  aftermathedit  a british honduras postage stamp overprinted in 1962 to mark the hurricane  after hattie struck officials in belize city declared martial law.9 a manager of united press international described belize city as but a huge pile of matchsticks,9 and many roads were either flooded for days or covered with mud.19 doctors provided typhoid vaccinations to 12,000residents in two days to prevent the spread of the disease due to the high death toll officials ordered mass cremations to stop additional disease from spreading.20 at the citys police station workers provided fresh water and rice to storm victims.9 many residents throughout british honduras donated supplies to the storm victims such that an airlines manager described it as manpower and facilities one airline allowed donations to be flown to belize city at no cost.16 the citys three newspapers were unable to operate due to lack of power after the storm.16 by November5, belize citys post office reopened on a limited basis and all business initially remained closed about 4,000homeless residents from stann creek were moved by boat to the northern portion of the territory.18 many homeless people from the belize city area set up a tent city on bushland about 16mi inland which was initially intended to be temporary.1821 in december 1961, barracks were erected near a red cross hospital to house the homeless in the camp the site was named hattieville and became a proper city with utilities installed in the subsequent decade.21  about 200British soldiers arrived from jamaica to quell looting and maintain order.1820 at least 20people were arrested in the day after hattie struck.15 the british government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food clothing and medical supplies.9 the house of commons quickly passed a bill to provide 10,000in aid the save the children fund sent 1,000to british Honduras,22 and the mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory.9 two american destroyers arrived in the country by November2, reporting the need for assistance.9 the uss antietam remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six marine helicopters four other ships sailed to the territory to provide 458,000lb of food.2023 the united states government allocated about assistance through the international development Association.22 the canadian government provided C75,000worth of aid including food blankets and medical supplies.24  by hatties one year anniversary private and public workers repaired and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm new hotels were constructed and many stores were reopened prime minister george cadle price successfully appealed for assistance from the british government which ultimately provided 20millionin loans.25 in the days after the storm the government announced plans to relocate the capital of british honduras farther inland on higher ground work on the new capital belmopan was completed in 1970.826 on the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of belize unveiled a monument in belize city to recognize the victims of the hurricane.27  due to the destruction and loss of life attributed to the hurricane the name hattie was retired by the world meteorological organization and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane.28  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  belize portal  list of retired atlantic hurricane names  list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes  list of wettest tropical cyclones in the cayman
