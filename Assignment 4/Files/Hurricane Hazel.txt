atlantic hurricane season  hurricane hazel was the deadliest and costliest hurricane of the 1954 atlantic hurricane season the storm killed at least 400people in haiti before striking the united states near the border between north and south carolina as a category 4 hurricane after causing 95fatalities in the us hazel struck canada as an extratropical storm raising the death toll by 81people, mostly in toronto as a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by hazel its name was retired from use for north atlantic hurricanes  in haiti hazel destroyed 40of the coffee trees and 50of the cacao crop affecting the economy for several years to come the hurricane made landfall near calabash north carolina and destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact from north carolina it traveled north along the atlantic coast hazel affected virginia washington dc west virginia maryland delaware new jersey pennsylvania and new york it brought gusts near 160kmh and caused usd in damage when it was over pennsylvania hazel consolidated with a cold front and turned northwest towards canada when it hit ontario as an extratropical storm rivers and streams in and around toronto overflowed their banks which caused severe flooding as a result many residential areas located in the local floodplains such as the raymore drive area were subsequently converted to parkland in canada alone over C135million of damage was incurred  the effects of hazel were particularly unprecedented in toronto due to a combination of heavy rainfall during the preceding weeks a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storms unexpected retention of power hazel had traveled 1,100km over land but while approaching canada it had merged with an existing powerful cold front the storm stalled over the greater toronto area and although it was now extratropical it remained as powerful as a category1 hurricane to help with the cleanup 800members of the military were summoned and a hurricane relief fund was established that distributed in aid  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  3.1 caribbean  3.2 united states  3.3 canada  4 aftermath

to the saffirsimpson scale  on October5, a tropical wave with tropical-storm force winds was approaching the lesser antilles due to the potential for tropical storm formation a hurricane hunters plane flew from san juan puerto rico to investigate the system.1 when the plane reached the system they observed a tropical cyclone about 30mi east of the island of grenada with winds estimated at 100mph the united states weather bureau promptly classified the system as hurricane Hazel.2 the atlantic hurricane reanalysis later assessed that hazel developed at 0600UTC on October5 about 220mi east of grenada although the hurricane hunters observed hurricane-force winds the storm had a small eye 5mi in diameter and a central barometric pressure of 1,002mbar the 100mph winds were therefore revised downward to 65mph late on October5, though it was estimated that the storm attained hurricane status at 0000UTC on October6. at the same time hazel made landfall on grenada with winds of 75mph  after entering the caribbean sea hazel continued to present a small eye and wind diameter the winds gradually increased as the storm moved westward parallel to the northern venezuela coast on October8, the tiny eye increased to a diameter of 29mi while the winds reached 85mph although winds were estimated as high as 125mph that day the hurricane hunters encountered severe turbulence which hospitalized one crew member and injured another.4 for the next five days there were no further flights into the core of the hurricane although the planes continued to monitor the storm with radar imagery indicating that the eye became open and ragged late on October9, it is estimated hazel intensified into a major hurricane with winds of 115mph originally it was estimated that hazel attained these winds the day prior the intensification was confirmed on October10, when aircraft noted a well-defined eye on radar imagery.3  on October10, hazel slowed in the central caribbean and turned sharply to the north-northeast toward Hispaniola,3 steered by an upper-level low.5 at 0900UTC on October12, the hurricane made landfall near chardonnires along the tiburon peninsula of haiti as a category 3 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale there were no strong wind readings at landfall but based on previous radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at 120mph after moving through the gulf of gonve hazel struck northwestern haiti near baie-de-henne at 0000UTC on October13, as a category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at 100mph around that time the hurricane curved more to the north and northwest due to an approaching trough,6 and the hurricane hunters resumed entering the center of hazel reporting an eye and hurricane force winds at 1400UTC on October13, hazel struck inagua in the bahamas with winds of 100mph  the weston golf club was left submerged after the humber river overflowed its banks during hurricane hazel in toronto  after affecting the bahamas hazel accelerated northwest toward the southeastern united States,3 steered between a trough and a ridge.6 hurricanes are generally expected to lose power after going north of florida due to lower water temperatures however hazel restrengthened as it tracked northward over the gulf Stream.7 the hurricane hunters were unable to observe the core of the storm until it neared land reporting an eye 18mi in diameter on October15. later that day a ship just offshore south carolina reported a central pressure of 938mbar which was the lowest in association with the hurricane at 1530UTC on October15, hazel made landfall just west of the north carolinasouth carolina border with a 40mi eye slightly northeast of myrtle beach in the latter state based on the pressure a larger than average size and the fast forward movement the landfall intensity was estimated at 130mph or a Category4 on the saffir-simpson scale.3  the eye of hazel was tracked across several towns in north carolina as the system continued northward at 1800UTC on October15, the hurricane became extratropical near raleigh and within six hours had passed near washington dc the extratropical remnants of hazel accelerated to the north through pennsylvania and new york along an extended cold front despite widespread observations across the eastern united states there was uncertainty in the track of hazel as an extratropical storm although it was possible the original circulation dissipated over western pennsylvania and a new one formed over western new york the atlantic hurricane reanalysis assessed the circulation as becoming elongated but continuous on October16, the storm crossed into ontario and over the toronto region.3 shortly thereafter the former hurricane hazel dropped to gale-force winds after moving almost 1,000km over land.36 the storm slowed and turned northward passing over james bay early on October17. after turning to the northeast the remnants of hazel were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over canada on October18.6  preparationsedit  on october 6, small craft warnings were issued for the dutch islands of aruba bonaire and curaao despite predictions that hazel would pass to the north8 these warnings were canceled a day later.9 after the storm had turned northward tropical cyclone warnings were posted for haiti the dominican republic and the waters of the mona Passage.10 small craft near jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm.11 the us navy completed extensive preparations at its guantanamo bay base ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened fortified quonset huts flying aircraft out of the storms path and positioning surface ships out at sea.12  then on october 14, the national weather bureau issued a warning for the carolinas with the caveat that the worst of the hurricane was expected to stay offshore instead the storm took a sharp northwest turn and headed toward land.13 by evening of the same day the storm was forecast to make landfall near the carolinas border.13 further forecasts expected hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the allegheny Mountains.6  in her book hurricane hazel canadian journalist betty kennedy argued that in canada the impressions that hazel was best-kept secret in town and that it was a documented meteorological event that should have taken nobody by surprise both contain a great deal of truth.14 meteorologists predicted that if hazel merged with the cold front the storm would not lose intensity but would instead potentially strengthen two special weather bulletins were issued by the dominion weather office but since it was expected that the storm would pass east of toronto few other warnings were given and there were no evacuations which increased the eventual property damage and loss of life.6 the forecast called for high winds between 65kmh and 80kmh with only occasional showers on lakes erie and ontario ships received warnings of strong winds and the predicted wind speeds ranged from 65kmh to 120kmh toronto hydro had called in standby crews as heavy winds were forecast although they were almost sent home at one point due to a lull in the storm.15  there had been significant rainfall in the toronto area in the two weeks prior to hazel so the ground was already saturated few people in canada had any experience with hurricanes since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as Toronto.16 kennedy also notes that if had been about to face a blizzard or was threatened by a 14-inch snowfall that would have been something understandable this was different this was the unknown the unfamiliar the totally unexpected crisis hurricanes belonged in the tropics.17  impactedit  deaths and damage by

october 8, two crew members on reconnaissance aircraft were injured due to turbulence while observing hazel one was severely enough injured to require hospitalisation.22 the abc islands of aruba bonaire and curaao located north of venezuela received rough winds and rains of up to 9.8 inches when the intensifying cyclone passed to the north flash flooding in aruba and curaao destroyed a bridge and several water dams and resulted in losses of USD.23 puerto rico suffered its worst flooding since 1899 as a result of the hurricane due to timely warnings only nine people were killed eight by drowning and one by a landslide however infrastructure buildings and agricultural areas suffered serious damage and over 11,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas.24  in haiti hazel brought flash floods which destroyed numerous villages and high winds which caused considerable damage to major cities the death toll was estimated to be as high as 1,000people most of the casualties drowned when the water flowed in a flood down the mountains some of which were as high as 2,400m the situation was exacerbated by deforestation which lessened the ability of the soil to hold water haitis south peninsula took the brunt of the storm the largest town aux cayes reported at least 200 casualties while the second-largest town of jrmie was reported to have been washed in the sea with at least 200 more casualties.25 damage in aux cayes was estimated to be USD.26 estimates of people left homeless in the wake of hazel are as high as 100,000.19 hazel destroyed about 40 of the coffee trees and 50 of the cacao crop affecting the countrys economy for several years.2728 objects from haiti such as bowls were reported to have been transported by the hurricane to the carolinian coast.29  west of haiti the hurricane brought hurricane-force winds to Cuba.3 a fisherman on the eastern tip of cuba was killed by rough seas while trying to secure his boats.12 since the hurricane passed largely east of the bahamas only minor damage was reported there hazel passed directly over inagua where it claimed six lives when a sailboat capsized while taking shelter from the storm.22  united statesedit  in south carolina the storm produced 1011ft tides along the coast.30 hundreds of buildings were destroyed including about 80 of waterfront dwellings in myrtle beach as a result of the high storm surge the low-lying sandy barrier islands were completely flooded.31 two piers in myrtle beach were damaged in north myrtle beach a 3-story hotel and a 800ft pier were washed out to sea at cherry grove beach 75residences were demolished while at pawleys island 40homes were destroyed while numerous others were damaged one death occurred in south carolina damage in the state totaled about  at landfall the hurricane brought a storm surge of over 5.5m to a large area of coastline producing severe coastal damage the damage was greater since the hurricane coincided with the highest lunar tide of the year.32 brunswick county north carolina suffered the heaviest damage where most coastal dwellings were either destroyed or severely damaged for example in long beach north carolina only five of the 357 buildings were left standing.29 the official report from the weather bureau in raleigh north carolina stated that as a result of hazel traces of civilization on the immediate waterfront between the state line and cape fear were practically annihilated.33 according to noaa pier in a distance of 170 miles kilometres of coastline was demolished.22  at the raleigh-durham airport in north carolina gusts of 90mph were recorded in surrounding cities including kinston goldsboro and faison wind gusts were estimated to have reached 120mph with such high winds state-wide heavy damage was caused to forests and to property as a result of falling trees however since the carolinas like the rest of the southeastern united states were suffering from a severe drought the heavy rainfall brought by hazel was welcome in north carolina the most rain was received in the interior of the state robbins received 286mm of rain and carthage received 247mm  nineteen people were killed in north carolina with several hundred more injured 15,000 homes were destroyed and another 39,000 were damaged.32 the number of people left homeless by the storm was thousands.35 damages in the carolinas amounted to with incurred by beachfront property.436 total damage in the united states ranged from to  while hazel caused the most damage in the carolinas the storm did not lose all of its intensity going north hazel turned extratropical by midday when it merged with a cold front however it retained hurricane-strength winds and it was continuing to drop heavy rainfall.2237  in virginia wind gusts of over 100mph were observed at the weather bureau office in norfolk roofs were blown off trees and power lines were toppled windows were shattered and awnings were torn the naval station suffered mainly minor damage to its temporary installations.38 the tugboat indian carrying five barges sank in the james river four of the eight crew members drowned.39 one building was demolished and several others were damaged in Portsmouth.38 the ferry princess anne was beached into the docks at Kiptopeke.39 an unfinished vessel at the newport news shipbuilding in newport news broke from its moorings and was swept into the shore of the james river the roof of the custom house was detached and landed on the street.38 in richmond 200store fronts were damaged while part of the steeple at trinity methodist church was toppled additionally a 150ft microwave tower in warsaw was knocked over.39 approximately 50 of residents in virginia lost telephone and electrical service for six days the storm damaged approximately 18,000homes and businesses overall there were 12deaths and about in damage.39  after north carolina the storm went through virginia west virginia maryland delaware new jersey pennsylvania and new york in general power was knocked out and trees were downed wind gusts throughout the area reached 160kmh though not near the center a gust of 182kmh was recorded in battery park the highest wind speed ever recorded within the municipal boundaries of new york city  rain amounts were heavier on the western side of the storm in west virginia the average amount of rain received was 230mm with localized amounts of 300mm reported in the appalachians to the north in pittsburgh only 90mm of rain was reported.40  to the east the washington dc area was particularly affected and considerable flooding was reported in the virginias and maryland much of the grounds of the naval academy in annapolis md were flooded and the midshipmen were put to work the next day cleaning up debris new jersey escaped major flooding as the high tide was low enough but to the south in chesapeake bay the majority of crab pots were destroyed.41 hazel lost a considerable amount of moisture when crossing the allegheny mountains which raised rivers and streams in the pittsburgh area significantly above the flood mark in pennsylvania the winds were still high enough to unroof several homes.37  in upstate new york the storm blocked highways and railroads.37  canadaedit  main article effects of hurricane hazel in canada  deadliest canada hurricanes  rank  hurricane  season

rainfall peaking at 8.4in in snelgrove ontario in three hours the city received 3.5in of precipitation most of these rains ran off into rivers and creeks of toronto which raised water levels by as much as 2026ft not built to withstand heavy flooding torontos infrastructure took a heavy hit over 50bridges, many parts of important highways as well as numerous roads and railways were destroyed when the high water washed them out or carried debris and smashed them.4243  floodwaters slowly rose in holland marsh a bowl-shaped valley near bradford allowing people to escape to the town.44 highway 400, which passes through the marsh was under as much as 10ft of water in some places when as much 6m of water backed up much of the crops in the area were either swept away or ruined.45 after the water pumps failed due to debris better equipment allowed the holland marsh to be drained by november 13.46 the humber river in the west end of toronto caused the most destruction as a result of an intense flash flood after most minor rivers and creeks drained into it.47 a team of five volunteer firefighters were killed when their fire truck was swept away as they were responding to help a stranded motorist.48 communities in the humber floodplain were devastated at woodbridge the river swelled from its usual width of 20m at its narrowest point to 107m and left hundreds homeless and nine dead the humber swept away 366m of raymore drive and 14nearby homes killing 35people out of the 81Canadian fatalities the rise of the river was unprecedented and the residents did not evacuate which led to the high death toll.47 the etobicoke creek also overflowed its banks at the village of long branch killing seven people after many dwellings were swept into lake Ontario.49  the death toll of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural disaster in canada in addition to the casualties over 4,000 families were left homeless.50 the department of public safety and emergency preparedness canada estimates the total cost of hurricane hazel for canada taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption the cost of lost property and recovery costs to be C137,552,400.51  aftermathedit  haitiedit  in the aftermath of hazel a three-day period of national mourning was declared in haiti for hurricane victims with existing infrastructure already poor the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked and communications equipment was either out damaged or destroyed the haitian red cross appealed for assistance to the international red cross while the american red cross made a donation of usd pan american world airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid,52 and the us aircraft carrier uss saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies.53 despite the relief effort there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following hazel due to a lack of clean water.54  united statesedit  in the carolinas the national guard was mobilised by the evening of october 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline on october 17, president dwight d eisenhower declared a disaster in the carolinas and offered and unlimited federal assistance.55 recovery was quick and by october 24, all but two units were demobilised another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts an artificial sand dune barrier 39km long was completed by october 30, which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes with myrtle beach a popular tourist destination the chamber of commerce began an information campaign to inform the public which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed that the city would be ready for the coming summer the rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform myrtle beach from a summer colony to a high-rise resort city.56  canadaedit  main article effects of hurricane hazel in canada  a weir was built on the humber river near raymore drive to lessen the risk of a similar catastrophic flood  the army sent about 800soldiers to toronto to assist with the cleanup providing blankets and mattresses toronto residents helped out with the relief effort the salvation army received so many donations of clothes footwear blankets food and money that its storage facilities were overfilled forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed.57 a hurricane relief fund was established to coordinate financial donations ultimately raising about the fund received donations from organisations companies and individuals including pope pius xii the ford motor company of canada the united church of canada laura secord candy shops and the british-american oil company a portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses.57  the toronto and region conservation authority was created after the storm to manage the areas floodplains and rivers such as building dams.58 the heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes and most of the land was later converted into an extensive park system along torontos rivers a footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the humber river in raymore park which was the former raymore Drive.59  retirementedit  as a result of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the caribbean united states and canada the name hazel was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane however since it was retired before the inception of naming lists with the modern six-year cycle it was not directly replaced with any particular name.60  see alsoedit  tropical
