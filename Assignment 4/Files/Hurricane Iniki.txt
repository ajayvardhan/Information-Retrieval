the strong 199095 el nio iniki was one of eleven central pacific tropical cyclones during that season it attained tropical storm status on september 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day after turning north iniki struck the island of kauai on september 11 at peak intensity it had winds of 145 miles per hour and reached Category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale it had recorded wind gusts of 225 as evidenced by an anemometer that was found blown into the forest during clean up it was the first hurricane to hit the state since hurricane iwa in the 1982 season and the first major hurricane since hurricane dot in 1959. iniki dissipated on september 13 about halfway between hawaii and alaska  iniki caused around of damage and six deaths at the time iniki was among the costliest united states hurricanes and it remains one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern pacific the storm struck just weeks after hurricane andrew the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time struck florida  the central pacific hurricane center failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24hours in advance despite the lack of early warning only six deaths ensued damage was greatest on kauai where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses and severely damaged more than 5,000. though not directly in the path of the eye oahu experienced moderate damage from

historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origin of iniki is unclear but it possibly began as a tropical wave that exited the african coast on august 18. it moved westward across the unfavorable atlantic ocean and crossed central america into the pacific on the august 28. the wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized conditions slowly became more favorable and as the convection concentrated around a center the wave was classified tropical depression eighteen-e on september 5. at this time the wave was located 1700miles southwest of cabo san lucas or 1550miles east-southeast of Hilo.1 initially the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength.2 the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until september 8, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm.1  iniki as a newly formed tropical storm next to hurricane orlene  located at the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central pacific it reached hurricane status on september 9 while 470miles south-southeast of hilo the subtropical ridge which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the hawaiian islands weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed iniki to turn to the northwest with very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures iniki steadily intensified and attained major hurricane status on september 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.1  as iniki turned to the north it continued to strengthen reaching a peak of 145mph winds on september 11 while 170miles south-southwest of poip on the island of kauai it continued rapidly to the north-northeast and made landfall on south-central kauai early on the 11th with sustained winds of 145mph making iniki a Category4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the national weather service reported wind gusts of up to 175mph the highest recorded wind speed from hurricane iniki was a 227mph reading3 from the navys makaha ridge radar station according to the honolulu advertiser that remarkable figure was recorded at a digital weather station whose wind gauging equipment blew off after taking the measurement during the storm after crossing the island iniki rapidly accelerated north-northeastward weakened rapidly and was absorbed by a cold front as it lost tropical characteristics and became extratropical on september 13 about halfway between alaska and Hawaii.1  preparationsedit  the central pacific hurricane center failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance for several days prior to the disaster the cphc and the news media forecast iniki to remain well south of the island chain with the only effect being some high surf conditions some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated hawaiian islands but these were rejected by the cphc forecasters as late as early september 10, the cphc suggested that iniki would remain well to the south of the island group it was not until a special bulletin was issued by the cphc less than 24hours before landfallthat any warning was given to the public.4  a hurricane watch was issued for kauai early on september 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day.1 prior to inikis arrival in kauai 8,000people were housed in shelters many of whom remembered hurricane iwa 10years prior.5 because schools were canceled traffic was light during the evacuation and streets were clear by mid-morning rather than sending tourists to public shelters two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storms passage.5  the cphc issued a tropical storm warning for oahu on september 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day.1 though not hit by the hurricane inikis large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in oahu public school buildings acted as shelters and were for refuge only meaning they did not provide food cots blankets medications or other comfort items roughly one-third of oahus population participated in the evacuation though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter the execution of the evacuations went well beginning with the vulnerable coastal area for those in need vans and buses gave emergency transportation while police manned certain overused intersections the two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.5  impactedit  known pacific hurricanes with over

thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power although oahu also suffered significant damage iniki also was responsible for six deaths.1  the hurricane nearly struck the central pacific hurricane center in honolulu had it hit there iniki along with hurricane andrew and typhoon omar would have struck each of the three national weather service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.4  kauaiedit  hurricane iniki made landfall on the south-central portion of kauai island bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire island.1 upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.56feet with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet in addition strong waves of up to 35feet in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours causing a debris line of more than 800feet inland because it moved quickly through the island there were no reports of significant rainfall.5  hurricane iniki making landfall on kauai  hurricane inikis making landfall during daylight hours combined with the popularity of camcorders led many kauai residents to record much of the damage as it was occurring the footage was later used to create an hour-long video documentary.7 commercial air service was suspended.8  wind damage to trees from iniki  hurricane inikis high winds caused extensive damage in kauai 1,421houses were destroyed and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action a total of 5,152homes were severely damaged while 7,178 received minor damage.1 on the south coast hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well a few were restored quickly though some took several years to be rebuilt one hotelthe coco palms resort famous for elvis presleys blue hawaiinever reopened after the hurricane.9 destroyed housing across the island left more than 7,000people homeless after the storms passage.10  sidewalk and tree damage from iniki  inikis high winds also downed 26.5 of the islands transmission poles 37 of its distribution poles and 35 of its 800mile distribution wire system the entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of time.10 electric companies restored only 20 of the islands power service within four weeks of iniki while other areas were without power for up to three months also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector.1 though much of the sugar cane was already harvested,10 what was left was severely damaged the winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.1  most of inikis damage occurred in kauai on the island one person died when struck by debris while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her offshore two japanese nationals died when their boat capsized the reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation more than 100injuries can be attributed to iniki though most occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane.1  among those on kauai was filmmaker steven spielberg who was preparing for the final day of on-location shooting of the film jurassic park he and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during inikis passage.1112 according to spielberg single structure was in shambles roofs and walls were torn away telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see spielberg included footage of iniki battering the kauai coastal walls as part of the completed film where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot members of the films crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads.11  oahuedit  upon passing by oahu iniki produced tides of 1.73feet above normal.5 prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of oahu with the areas most affected being barbers point through Kaena.1 the waianae coastline experienced the most damage with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments.13 in all hurricane iniki caused several million dollars in property damage,5 and two deaths on Oahu.1  big islandedit  damage on the island of hawaii was minor seas of 10ft were reported along with 40mph winds.14 in honokhau harbor three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk a beach near napoopoo on kealakekua bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the same.15  aftermathedit  landfalling pacific major hurricanes  intensity is measured solely by wind speed  hurricane  season

survived the worst of the Category4 hurricane their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days because iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed many kauai citizens insisted on paying in addition entertainers from all of hawaii including graham nash owns a home on the north shore of kauai and the honolulu symphony provided free concerts to the victims.9  the film jurassic park was being filmed at the time the sets used for the deleted scene where mr arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel looting occurred in the aftermath of iniki though it was very minor a group of army corps of engineers who experienced the looting of hurricane andrew just weeks before were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane students returned to kauai public schools two weeks after the disaster kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help.9 the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs though and help arrived before local officials requested aid.25  amateur radio proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the pacific to assist in the recovery there was support of local government communications in lihue in the first week of recovery as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the american red cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across Kauai.26  in the months after the storm many insurance companies left hawaii to combat this state governor john d waihee iii enacted the hurricane relief fund in 1993 to help unprotected hawaii residents the fund was never needed for another hawaii hurricane and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island.27  it is thought that hurricane iniki blew apart many chicken coops some possibly used to house fighting chickens this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of wild chickens roaming Kauai.28  the name iniki was retired due to this storm and was replaced with iolana within the central north pacific tropical storm list.29 less than three days after iniki struck hurricane orlene struck the big island as a depression
