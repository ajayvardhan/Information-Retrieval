found on pre pgm fi bikes whilst the CBR600F FS1FS2 f sport were sold with the two tier seat units black frames and various other performance upgrades as found in the us model CBR600F4I. the f sport was discontinued upon the arrival of the CBR600RR in 2003. in 2003, honda introduced the CBR600RR, as a higher-performance race-ready race replica alternative to hondas more street oriented 600-class sport bike the CBR600F4i.8 in 2004, the one-piece seat model replaced the split seat model this bike sacrificed a little performance but gained a more comfortable riding position with the one piece seat in addition to the clip-ons mounted above the top fork clamp already and also replacing the black frame with one in silver.910 as well as an engine configuration better suited to everyday riding this model is the same as the CBR600F1 and onwards that was sold in the uk from 2001.The F4i remained available for three more years before being discontinued with the 2006 model being the final one to be released no major updates were made in these final years except for color scheme changes  historyedit  for the 2001 model year honda released an upgraded version of the popular CBR600F4 with

with a new dual-bulb configuration the F4i had a new dash layout with a large analog tachometer the new lcd digital display had a speedometer odometer clock engine temperature read-out amber shift light and trip metersthe single largest change aside from the styling is the addition of high-pressure programmed fuel injection thus the model designation in a number of countries the bike was sold in both the and variants the sport having a two-part seat no grab rail and no main stand the main stand mounting holes remained fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions the injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38mm throttle bodies each injector has four nozzles and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the F4.  weight was also reduced the rear wheel was made lighter and the front wheel.9 the rotor carriers moved out closer to the brake calipers to reduce weight and to improve rigidity but stopping power still was not on par with other bikes in the class there is additional bracing on the steering head for more response better feedback and feel from the front end the suspension has also been tweaked with less high-speed damping and a little more low-speed damping with the shock and fork being more street-bias.13  honda CBR600F  manufacturer

increased valve spring pressure springs per intake valve which allow for higher revving there are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow redline is now 14,200rpm,9 700rpm higher than the previous years F4.14 to increase the bikes pulling capabilities at high speeds 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46.Also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8.14 the oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5mm 2.5mm and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling.14 spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float also there are now two valve springs and outer on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side.15  the F4is new bodywork carries a more racy look and provides a 3 reduction in drag it also houses a new dual headlight front cowl design which uses 40 brighter H7 bulbs compared to the old H4 bulbs.14 the headlights are dual multi-reflector units covered by a one-piece flexiglass lens the turn stalks are shorter and the mirrors are now positioned higher and closer to the rider the elimination of carburetors allowed for a slightly larger air box and a larger 4.8USgal 4.0impgal fuel tank and a fuel consumption of 36.7mpgUS 44.1mpgimp.16  in 2001 and 2002, in recognition of hondas association with motogp champion valentino rossi and its 500th motorcycle grand prix victory the CBR600F4i was also released in europe and

stefan bradl honda germany launched a special edition of the CBR600F the CBR600F lcr it featured an arrow titanium exhaust progrip handlebar grips a rear hugger and single seat cover and an lcr sticker kit as well as combined braking and ABS.18 the CBR600F shares most of the components of the naked CB600F such as inverted fork though longer by 50mm and aluminium mono-backbone frame.1920 but wraps it in a multi-layered full fairing that lowers drag and protects the rider from windblast as well as new instruments bars and tank it also retains a similar relaxed seating position to minimise rider fatigue.21 the 2011 CBR600F also shares the engine of the highly revised CB600F model that came out in april 2007. this engine is a detuned version of that which is available in the 2007
