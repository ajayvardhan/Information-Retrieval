historyedit  main article history of columbia university  colonialedit  kings college hall 1770  discussions regarding the founding of a college in the province of new york began as early as 1704, at which time colonel lewis morris wrote to the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts the missionary arm of the church of england persuading the society that new york city was an ideal community in which to establish a college.34 however it was not until the founding of the college of new jersey present princeton university across the hudson river in new jersey that the city of new york seriously consider founding a college.34 in 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of new york to raise funds for the foundation of a new college in 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten new york residents seven of whom were members of the church of england to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.35  classes were initially held in july 1754 and were presided over by the colleges first president dr samuel Johnson.36 dr johnson was the only instructor of the colleges first class which consisted of a mere eight students instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining trinity church located on what is now lower broadway in Manhattan.37 the college was officially founded on october 31, 1754, as kings college by royal charter of king george ii making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of new york and the fifth oldest in the united States.20  in 1763, dr johnson was succeeded in the presidency by myles cooper a graduate of the queens college oxford and an ardent tory in the charged political climate of the american revolution his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, alexander Hamilton.38 the american revolutionary war broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of kings college which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the continental army the suspension continued through the military occupation of new york city by british troops until their departure in 1783. the colleges library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by american and then british forces.3940 loyalists were forced to abandon their kings college in new york which was seized by the rebels and renamed columbia college the loyalists led by bishop charles inglis fled to windsor nova scotia where they founded kings collegiate School.41  18th centuryedit  the gothic revival law school building on the madison avenue campus  after the revolution the college turned to the state of new york in order to restore its vitality promising to make whatever changes to the schools charter the state might demand.42 the legislature agreed to assist the college and on may 1, 1784, it passed act for granting certain privileges to the college heretofore called kings College.43 the act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of kings college and in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new republic the legislature stipulated that college within the city of new york heretofore called kings college be forever hereafter called and known by the name of columbia College,43 a reference to columbia an alternative name for america the regents finally became aware of the colleges defective constitution in february 1787 and appointed a revision committee which was headed by john jay and alexander hamilton in april of that same year a new charter was adopted for the college still in use today granting power to a private board of 24 Trustees.44  on may 21, 1787, william samuel johnson the son of dr samuel johnson was unanimously elected president of columbia college prior to serving at the university johnson had participated in the first continental congress and been chosen as a delegate to the constitutional Convention.45 for a period in the 1790s, with new york city as the federal and state capital and the country under successive federalist governments a revived columbia thrived under the auspices of federalists such as hamilton and jay both president george washington and vice president john adams attended the colleges commencement on may 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the american Revolution.46  the library at columbia university ca 1900  19th century to presentedit  low memorial library  in november 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with the college of physicians and surgeons a new school created by the regents of new york forming columbia university college of physicians and Surgeons.2 the colleges enrollment structure and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned in 1857, the college moved from the kings college campus at park place to a primarily gothic revival campus on 49thStreet and madison avenue where it remained for the next forty years during the last half of the 19th century under the leadership of president fap barnard the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university.47 by this time the colleges investments in new york real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school mainly owing to the citys expanding population.48 university president seth low moved the campus from 49thStreet to its present location a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of morningside Heights.49 under the leadership of lows successor nicholas murray butler who served for over four decades columbia rapidly became the nations major institution for research setting the model that later universities would adopt.20 prior to becoming the president of columbia university butler founded teachers college as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor with philanthropist grace hoadley Dodge.50 teachers college came under the aegis of columbia university in 1893 and became the universitys graduate school of Education.51  research into the atom by faculty members john r dunning i i rabi enrico fermi and polykarp kusch placed columbias physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the manhattan Project.52 in 1928, seth low junior college was established by columbia university in order to mitigate the number of jewish applicants to columbia College.53 the college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the great depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into university Extension.54 in 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the school of general studies in response to the return of gis after world war II.55 in 1995, the school of general studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students who have had an academic break of one year or more or are pursuing dual-degrees and was fully integrated into columbias traditional undergraduate curriculum.56 within the same year the division of special programslater the school of continuing education and now the school of professional studieswas established to reprise the former role of university Extension.57 while the school of professional studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.58  alma mater  in the aftermath of world war ii the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university and in response the school of international and public affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science economics and history.59  during the 1960s columbia experienced large-scale student activism which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus the incident forced the resignation of columbias president grayson kirk and the establishment of the university Senate.6061  though several schools within the university had admitted women for years columbia college first admitted women in the fall of 1983, after a decade of failed negotiations with barnard college the all-female institution affiliated with the university to merge the two schools.62 barnard college still remains affiliated with columbia and all barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both columbia university and barnard College.63  in the 1970s, teachers colleges departments ran joint phd programs with the university in the disciplines of psychology history and anthropology and all teachers college diplomas were conferred by columbia University.50 teachers college was soon established as the universitys faculty of education and department of Education.51  during the late 20th century the university underwent significant academic structural and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university for much of the 19th century the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in political science philosophy and pure science in 1979, these faculties were merged into the graduate school of arts and Sciences.64 in 1991, the faculties of columbia college the school of general studies the graduate school of arts and sciences the school of the arts and the school of professional studies were merged into the faculty of arts and sciences leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools in 2010, the school of international and public affairs which was previously a part of the faculty of arts and sciences became an independent faculty.65  campusedit

leaf during the columbia university protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture but it has since been repaired.76 the small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many columbia legends

student given that barnard is a womens college.7778  steps alternatively known as steps or the beach are a popular meeting area for columbia students the term refers to the long series of granite
