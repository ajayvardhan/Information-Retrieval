the west coast of africa in late july a weather station in dakar senegal observed a wind shift on July23. the system moved quickly across the atlantic at 20 and 25mph and 40kmh and reached the lesser antilles by July28.1 the wave then continued moving rapidly westward across the caribbean sea however falling atmospheric pressures over the southern united states eroded a subtropical ridge causing the system to decelerate by July30. around that time a closed circulation began to organize in the northwestern caribbean between the cayman islands and swan Island.2 at 0000UTC on July31, a tropical depression developed about 90mi west-southwest of grand Cayman.3 the depression strengthened while heading north-northwestward though a reconnaissance aircraft could not complete its mission on July31 due to the depressions proximity to Cuba.2  early on August1, the depression made landfall in western pinar del ro province Cuba.3 a weather station in cape san antonio recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1,007mbar after reaching the southeastern gulf of mexico on August1, warm sea surface temperatures caused the depression to undergo rapid deepening later that day the depression reached tropical storm intensity and was named based on a reconnaissance flight observing tropical storm force winds.2 satellite imagery indicated that celia was becoming significantly more organized.4 at 0000UTC on August2, reconnaissance aircraft data indicated that celia suddenly strengthened into a Category3 hurricane with sustained winds of 115mph however the storm weakened to a Category2
