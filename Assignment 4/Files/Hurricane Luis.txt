hurricane luis was a long-lived and an extremely destructive cape verde-type hurricane as well as one of the strongest deadliest and most notable hurricanes of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season with maximum sustained winds of 140mph luis was also the strongest hurricane to make landfall and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the extremely active season the storm was the twelfth tropical storm sixth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season at one point the storm was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the atlantic basin along with humberto iris and karen the storm lasted for 14days as a tropical storm between late august and nearly middle september  the system initially formed from a tropical wave south of cape verde islands west of africa on august 27 then subsequently attained tropical storm status on august 29. two days later that day the storm reached hurricane status shortly thereafter it rapidly strengthened into a 140mph category 4 hurricane.1 at this strength it affected much of the leeward islands on september 4 to september 6. throughout the following days luis gradually weakened as it accelerated safely to the west of bermuda as a category 1 hurricane luis made landfall on newfoundland before it became extratropical on september 11.  it caused catastrophic damage in antigua barbuda st barthelemy st martin and anguilla as a category 4 with winds of 130mph the storm accounted for 19 deaths left between 20,000 and 70,000 homeless in antigua barbuda and saint martin and caused roughly billion in damage across the affected areas hurricane luis was the most devastating hurricane to strike the northern leeward islands in the 20th century and one of the strongest storms to hit the leeward islands at the time along with hurricane david in 1979 and hurricane hugo in 1989. additionally luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect guadeloupe in a short period of time the first being hurricane iris a week before and the last being hurricane marilyn only ten days afterward the next year the leeward islands would be struck by hurricane bertha while still repairing from luis and marilyn then successively hit by hortense erika georges jose lenny and debby  luis was also responsible for an intense rogue wave which struck rmsqueen elizabeth 2 on monday september 11, though the ship pulled

historyedit  main article meteorological history of hurricane luis  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of hurricane luis trace back to an area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 26. a low-level circulation center formed and moved westward until it developed a weak surface low on august 27 consequently a tropical depression was designated at 1200 utc that day the depression attained 36 hours later into a tropical storm named on august 29. though convective activity fluctuated for the next two days as a result of nearby wind shear the storm slowly intensified while pressure rose the shear relented the next day allowing an eye to gradually form and the system attained hurricane status thereafter on early august 31 then a category 3 major hurricane 18 hours later.1  tropical storms karen and luis on August29  hurricane luis continued to strengthen as it tracked west-northwestward into a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on september 2 and the cyclone turned more towards the west earlier that day as it maintained a rectilinear slow motion on september 3, a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the storm that reached category 4 status earlier peaked with 140mph and maintained it for two days and a half at this time it was located approximately 540 miles to the east of the lesser antilles as a result the storm began to slightly accelerate as it moved along a subtropical ridge due to the absorption of karen by the stronger Iris.1  by the day of september 4, luis sustained a large wind field as it approach the lesser antilles its tropical storm-force winds measured from 345mi to 365mi in diameter as it begin to affected in the night antigua barbuda dominica and guadeloupe on the morning of september 5, islands such as dominica and even the islands of guadeloupe where it experienced hurricane-force winds on the northeastern coast of grande-terre and dsirade has been relatively spared by the storm however the eyewall of the hurricane skimed antigua and directly passing over barbuda while weakened slightly during the time it proceeded slowly northwestward affecting montserrat saint kitts and nevis sint eustatius and saba causing moderate damage later luis moved along st barthelemy st martin and ultimately crossed anguilla where maximum sustained winds within the eyewall were estimated to have reached 135mph and its central pressure had dropped from 945 to 942mbar to 27.8inHg.1  a large and powerful hurricane luis retained category 4 intensity until september 7, situated about 150mi to the north of puerto rico the storm gradually re-curved over the northern atlantic as a category 2 after having spent 7 consecutive days as a major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 115mph from september 1 to 8. from there on the center of the storm passed 200 miles to the west of bermuda on september 9 causing minor damage and then later weakened to a Category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph several hours later the hurricane made its closest approach to bermuda passing about 200mi west of the island.1 later that day the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of Luis.3 during the afternoon of September10, hurricane luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the canadian coastline.4 due to the rapid movement of the storm significant weakening did not occur until luis was at an unusually high latitude as the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar but sustained winds did not exceed 90mph according to the NHC.15  luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the avalon peninsula in eastern newfoundland early on September11.16 while tracking over newfoundland cold dry air became entrenched in luiss circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough the nhc issued their final advisory on hurricane luis at 0900UTC on September11 as it tracked nearly 65mph to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 11 as it moved ashore on eastern Newfoundland.17 the extratropical remnants persisted for 30more hours over the north atlantic ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of greenland late on September12.1  preparationsedit  hurricane luis on September6 to the north of the leeward islands  3 days before devastation occurred in the northern lesser antilles hurricane luis became a category 4 hurricane and forecasted to avoid those area well to the north following humberto and karen however as karen neared iris it weakened and absorbed by a stronger iris as influenced by the subtropical ridge steering luis to the west  leeward islands and puerto ricoedit  due to its slow motion giving local officials ample time to prepare in advance of the storm tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared in several areas throughout the caribbean seventeen watches andor warnings were issued in association with luis the first two were a hurricane watch issued on antigua barbuda and guadeloupe on September2 at 2200UTC. five hours later a tropical storm watch was issued for dominica at 2100UTC, a hurricane warning was issued for antigua barbuda and a hurricane watch for guadeloupe at 1500UTC, puerto rico was put under a tropical storm watch at 1700UTC, guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin were put under a hurricane warning four hours later puerto rico us and british virgin islands were put under a tropical storm warning this is including martinique and saint Lucia.1  bermuda and canadaedit  additionally a tropical storm warning was also issued for bermuda on september 7, all of which were canceled by september 10. however there were no tropical storm watches or warnings issued for any part of atlantic Canada.1

and barbudaedit  as a result of a direct hit from the Category4 hurricane both antigua and barbuda experienced extensive damage to residences from 135mph winds and over 10 inches of rain according to the islands prime minister a great number of houses were damaged or destroyed in barbuda and nearly 45 of the residences on antigua were eradicated by the hurricane as it passed 25 miles to the north of the island.1 across the islands numerous inhabitants experienced power outages and disrupted water systems the storm ultimately accounted for three deaths and injured 165 locals 32.000 inhabitants on both islands were greatly affected forced 1,700 people to take shelter and left approximately 3,200 others homeless throughout the country the total damage from the storm was estimated or 60 of the

passed 155miles north of saint barthelemy the main weather station recorded wind speeds of 125mph and gusts of up to 155mph this difference may be due to local effects produced by mountainous terrain

and lowest pressure recorded was between 1,000 to 1,005mbar to 29.7inHg. ultimately a fisherman was confirmed killed due to rough sea conditions.30 all in all property damage was estimated at the storm contributed to the effects of hurricane iris which had struck the country a week before and hurricane marilyn 10 days after total at  puerto ricoedit  luis passed at 120 miles northeast of puerto rico causing minor damages in the east.31 there were two deaths reported in the islands.20  bermudaedit  luis west of bermuda  bermuda reported sustained winds of 46 miles per hour however little to no damage has been reported offshore the storm produced waves approaching 100 feet in height.1  eastern united states and offshoreedit  rough seas from the storm affected the us east coast resulting in some beach erosion and damage to two waterfront structures on fire Island.32 on September7, rip currents produced by luis caused the death of one person near corncake inlet north Carolina.33 high waves in combination with high tide caused significant beach erosion and coastal flooding in brunswick county eight homes were washed away by the waves and 40 feet of beach was lost in hyde carteret and onslow counties waves up to 17 feet washed out 33 feet of the triple s pier in atlantic beach was destroyed total losses in north carolina amounted to in new york rough seas undermined one home destroyed it and led to the death of one person who was swimming in the high waves.1011  on september 11, a rogue wave triggered by luis slammed queen elizabeth 2 when it was about 200 nautical miles 230mi south of eastern Newfoundland.437 at about the same time a nearby canadian buoy recorded a 98-foot wave though the ship did not sustain any significant damage its arrival in

provided a cash assist of to antigua and barbuda the government of spain contributed in emergency funds to the affected regions.41  saint martinedit  aside from high winds and seas possible explanation for the storms heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations and their houses.1 another factual reason was substantial difference in wind speed forecasts measured at sea-level princess juliana airport on the dutch side and those measured on homes throughout the island hillsides broadcast from sites off the island sea-level airport readings showed 86mph sustained winds and winds gusting to 114mph whereas measurements on some hillside homes and especially the airport on the north of the french side between two mountains showed wind gusts between 170 and 205mph and 330kmh. an sailor that been sheltered in the lagoon recorded a 115mph winds gusting and a minimal pressure reading to 965mbar  records and retirementedit  see also list of retired

strengthened into tropical storm luis on August29, it marked the earliest date on which the twelfth named storm of any season formed surpassing the previous record set by tropical storm twelve of the 1933 season  shortly before becoming extratropical hurricane luis was moving at 65mph becoming one of the fastest moving atlantic hurricanes in recorded history.43  on September11, a 98 feet wave struck an ocean liner this wave is the largest wave ever recorded44 however hurricane ivan in 2004 may have produced a wave up to 130 feet high off the coast of Mexico.45  since 1950, there have been very few atlantic hurricanes that have had an accumulated cyclone energy index over 50. as it spent nearly fourteen days as a named storm luis achieved and ace value of 53.5, which was the highest since inez in 1966 and remained the highest until being surpassed by hurricanes isabel in 2003, ivan in 2004, and irma in 2017.  due to the severe damage and loss of life caused by the storm in the leeward islands the name was retired in the spring of 1996, and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with in the 2001 season luis was the first atlantic hurricane name
