the hurricane road access along NC12 was temporarily severed until the island was repaired and restored by sand pumped ashore by the army corps of engineerscitation needed in 2007, subtropical storm andrea caused high winds to push waves over dunes and onto the highway on hatteras island leaving water a foot deep and sand 2 to 3 feet deep in some places.16  nc 12 was severed in two places by hurricane irene in late august 2011. the road was breached by two small inlets about 200 feet across apiece in the pea island national wildlife refuge and north of rodanthe as a result the only way to access hatteras island was by ferry on october 10, 2011, a temporary bridge opened over the largest breach the bridge which is 662 feet long could be in place for more than 10 years while other solutions are thought out.17 as hurricane sandy battered the east coast in october 2012, it has left portions of nc 12 inundated with salt water and sand that forced the closure of the road leaving the remaining people on the outer banks isolated from mainland north carolinacitation needed  in late october 2012, hurricane sandy washed out and damaged a portion of the road at the s-curves north
