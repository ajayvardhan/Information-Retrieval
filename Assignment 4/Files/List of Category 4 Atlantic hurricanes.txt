list of category 4 atlantic hurricanes  igor near peak intensity as a strong Category4 hurricane on September13, 2010  Category4 hurricanes are tropical cyclones that reach Category4 intensity on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale Category4 hurricanes that later attained Category5 strength are not included in this list the atlantic basin includes the open waters of the atlantic ocean the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico Category4 is the second-highest hurricane classification category on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale and storms that are of this intensity maintain maximum sustained winds of 113136knots 209251kmh. based on the atlantic hurricane database 94hurricanes have attained Category4 hurricane status since 1851, the start of modern meteorological record keeping Category4 storms are considered extreme hurricanes hurricane ike which was a Category4 storm brought on a 24ft storm surge the third greatest storm surge ever recorded hurricane katrina and hurricane camille

to the average wind speed observed over one minute at a height of 10meters above ground gust can be 30 higher than the sustained winds.2 mobile homes and other buildings without fixed structures can be completely destroyed and the lower floors of sturdier structures usually sustain major damage in addition to the winds the cyclones generally produce a storm surge of 1318feet above normal potentially causing major beach erosion heavy irreparable damage andor near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are also very common and mobile and manufactured homes are often completely destroyed low-level terrain may be flooded well inland as well.3 in addition Category4 hurricanes are very often cape verde type hurricanes cape verde hurricanes are usually the strongest and their track sometimes points them towards the united states or other land.4  studies have shown that the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes nearly doubled in occurrence in from 1970 to 2004.5 also due to growing population in major coastal cities many areas have become more vulnerable to strong hurricanes especially categories 4 and 5.6  meteorological measurementsedit  all of the storms listed in this analysis are listed in chronological order but they also list the minimum central pressure and maximum sustained winds each of these meteorological readings are taken using a specific meteorological instrument for modern storms the minimum pressure measurements are taken by reconnaissance aircraft using dropsondes or by determining it from satellite imagery using the dvorak technique for older storms pressures are often incomplete typically being provided by ship-reports or land-observations none of these methods can provide constant pressure measurements thus it is possible the only measurement occurred when the cyclone was at a lesser strength.7 sustained winds are taken using an anemometer at 10meters above the ground.8  climatologyedit  a total of 95hurricanes in the atlantic ocean basin including the gulf of mexico and the caribbean have reached Category4 status as their peak intensity that Category4 storms that intensified later to category 5 status are not included in this analysis  most Category4 hurricanes occur during september with 51storms occurring in that month this coincides with the average peak of the atlantic hurricane season which occurs on september 10.9 most Category4 hurricanes develop in the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea several Category4 hurricanes are cape verde-type hurricanes there have been no Category4 hurricanes to form in either may or december or in any other month outside the traditional bounds of the atlantic hurricane season  list of category 4 hurricanesedit  listed in chronological orderedit  all data listed is provided by the nhc best track unless otherwise noted also some pressure readings for the older storms may have been taken at a time other than the storms peak intensity thus some pressure readings might not be the minimum pressure  some pressure readings are unavailable due to scarce information  hurricane frequency  period
