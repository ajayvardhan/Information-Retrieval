hurricane  and the pacific typhoon season  typhoon paka known in the philippines as typhoon rubing was the last tropical cyclone of the 1997 pacific ocean hurricane and typhoon season and was among the strongest pacific typhoons in the month of December.1 paka which is the hawaiian name for Pat,2 developed on november 28 from a trough well to the southwest of hawaii the storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration and on december 7 it crossed into the western pacific ocean much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity and on december 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the marshall islands on december 16, paka struck guam and rota with winds of 230kmh and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on december 18 over open waters subsequently it underwent a steady weakening trend and on december 23 paka dissipated  typhoon paka first impacted the marshall islands where it dropped heavy rainfall and left 7007800000000000000US80million in damages later it passed just north of guam where strong winds destroyed about 1,500buildings and damaged 10,000more 5,000people were left homeless and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon damage on the island totaled 7008500000000000000US500million, which warranted the retirement of its name paka also caused minor damage in the northern mariana islands and overall the typhoon caused no reported fatalities  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations and impact  2.1 marshall islands  2.2 guam  2.3 northern mariana

the weather synoptics of the northern pacific ocean transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern convection from the monsoon trough extended to the east of the international date line during late november a westerly disturbance developed into twin troughs on opposite sides of the equator the one in the southern hemisphere ultimately developed into tropical cyclone pam while the one in the northern hemisphere formed into an area of convection about 2000km southwest of hawaii the disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward and on november 28 it developed into tropical depression five-c about 465km west-northwest of palmyra atoll operationally the central pacific hurricane center did not begin issuing warnings on the system until december 2.2345  the tropical depression continued drifting north-northeastward and failed to strengthen significantly it turned to the west on december 1, due to the presence of a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the international date line on december 2, based on satellite estimates the cphc upgraded the depression to tropical storm paka while located about 1000km south-southeast of johnston atoll due to the presence of high clouds across the area forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation after becoming a tropical storm paka remained nearly stationary for about two days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest it steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures and on december 3 the storm attained winds of 105kmh the next day however it encountered dry air and began weakening by december 6, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12hours. subsequently paka began to re-intensify and on december 7 the storm crossed the international date line into the western north pacific ocean with winds of 80kmh  upon entering the western north pacific ocean tropical cyclone warning duties transferred from the cphc to the japan meteorological agency and the jma first assessed paka as a 65km storm.6 the joint typhoon warning center unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the united states department of defense paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line and from late on december 7 through early the following day it remained a strong tropical storm however upper-level wind shear increased and it again weakened at 1200UTC on december 9, the jtwc assessed paka as an 85kmh tropical storm and forecast it to continue weakening by december 10, the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the marshall islands and that night the jtwc upgraded paka to typhoon status.4 paka officially attained typhoon status when jma classified it with winds of 120kmh at 0000UTC on december 11.6  super typhoon paka on december 15  after attaining typhoon status paka strengthened fairly quickly and by december 12 it reached sustained winds of 150kmh for a ten-minute min duration,6 or 215kmh over a one-minute min duration subsequently it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased however paka again re-intensified and at 1200UTC on december 14 it attained the unofficial ranking of super typhoon status while over the open pacific Ocean.4 at the same time the jma classified it with 10 min sustained winds of 175kmh after reaching its initial peak intensity typhoon paka began to weaken as it approached the southern mariana islands the nexrad doppler weather radar from guam revealed the presence of a primary eyewall of 74km in diameter with a fragmented inner wall cloud of 19km in diameter.4 additionally satellite imagery indicated an eyewall mesovortex within the eye of the typhoon.7 it slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward and at 0530UTC on december 16 the northern portion of the outer eyewall of paka passed over the island of rota 20minutes later the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern Guam.4 as it tracked through the rota channel the center of paka passed about 8km north of the northern tip of guam its closest approach to the island.8  typhoon paka continued to steadily intensify after passing the marianas islands and late on december 17 it reached its peak intensity of 185kmh 10 min sustained while located 440km west-northwest of Guam.6 early on december 18, the jtwc assessed it as attaining peak winds of 295kmh 1 min winds.4 on december 19, it entered the area of responsibility of the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration or pagasa and was named Rubing.9 shortly thereafter paka moved through an area of progressively increasing wind shear which resulted in a steady weakening trend.7 by december 21, winds decreased to tropical storm status the next day it degenerated into a tropical depression before it dissipated on december 23.6  preparations and impactedit  marshall islandsedit  prior to the typhoon passing through the marshall islands several hundred residents on the island of ebeye fled to safer structures the threat of paka prevented continental micronesia from flying in or out of the area.10  paka entered the marshall islands between mili and majuro as a tropical storm on december 10, and after strengthening into a typhoon it left the archipelago on december 14.8 the cyclone affected several islands in the nation and the majuro and kwajalein atolls reported wind gusts in excess of 75kmh on jaluit atoll the typhoon dropped 217mm of precipitation in six hours with a total of about 300mm recorded in 30hours.11 strong waves inundated low-lying islands which flooded crops with salt water.10 the combination of the wind and flooding caused severe damage to banana papaya and lime trees across the territory.8 typhoon paka damaged 70 of the houses on ailinglaplap atoll and most of the coconut trees on the atoll were left toppled or damaged strong winds left large portions of ebeye island without electricity or telephone.10 the typhoon caused no reported deaths or injuries in the region and damage was estimated at 7007800000000000000US80million.8  guamedit  damage on guam  the guam national weather service issued a typhoon watch on december 14, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning the next day the antonio b won pat international airport was closed during the passage of paka with only emergency flights permitted.8  passing a short distance north of the island typhoon paka produced strong winds across northern guam though reliable wind reports are incomplete due to the long duration and intensity of the winds the highest reading believed to be reliable was at apra harbor there a station recorded a wind gust of 277kmh before the sensor failed as winds shifted to the southwest since the winds from the southwest were stronger and of greater duration officials believe gusts there reached 297kmh additionally andersen air force base recorded a peak wind gust of 381kmh which at the time was considered the highest wind speed on record surpassing the 1934 world record of 372kmh on mount washington in new Hampshire.13 however a subsequent wind survey of the area discarded the reading at the base as it was considered unreliable.12 as microbarographs are less exposed than wind sensors pressure readings on the island are considered accurate the lowest reading on the island was 948hPa at andersen air force Base.4 in two days the typhoon dropped about 533mm of precipitation on the northern portion of the island or about 89 of the monthly rainfall total.14 waves along northern guam reached about 11m in height.15  the strong winds from paka left around 1,500buildings destroyed on the island,15 of which 1,160 were single-family homes.8 a further 10,000buildings sustained damage to some degree,15 with 60 of the homes on the island reporting major damage.8 in all about 5,000people were left homeless due to the typhoon additionally an estimated 3040 of the public buildings received major damage.8 buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well as opposed to light metal-frame structures which more often than not were destroyed large tourist hotels near hagta on which guam is dependent received generally minor damage such as broken windows and damaged power generators.15  a damaged business at agaa  a complete island-wide power outage followed the typhoon damage to the main electrical transmission and distribution system was estimated at 7007160000000000000USD16million. following the passage of the typhoon 25 of the homes on guam were left without water.8 telephone service remained working after the storm due to most lines being underground strong waves washed away a few coastal roads in the northern portion of the island leaving them temporarily closed the waves surpassed the seawall at apra harbor damaging the road and infrastructure of the seaport many boats were washed ashore after breaking from their moorings strong winds damaged a radar system and lights along the runway of the antonio b won pat international airport though most airport facilities received light damage andersen air force base also sustained heavy damage with hundreds of downed trees and many facilities left damaged.15 across guam damage was estimated at 7008500000000000000USD500million.8 about 100people were injured,16 but the typhoon caused no deaths on the island.8  nexrad image of typhoon paka from guam  northern mariana islandsedit  a typhoon watch was issued for rota tinian and saipan on december 14, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning the next day.8 because paka was intensifying while passing to the south of rota the first wind or northeast through east winds was less severe than the second wind from the southeast.4 sustained winds on the island reached 145kmh with gusts reaching 185kmh many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird.17 while passing to the south of the island paka dropped 250300mm of rain.14 damage on the island totaled 2015USD.8 the typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.14  aftermathedit  following the passage of the typhoon in the ailinglaplap atoll in the marshall islands residents experienced severe food shortages due to damaged crops and little rainfall experts estimated the entire redevelopment of its fauna would require more than a decade as a result of the crop shortage large-scale evacuations of the islands residents were considered officials in the nation requested assistance from the federal emergency management agency of the united States,18 and on march 20, 1998, the area was declared a disaster area the declaration allowed for the usage of emergency funds.19  on december 17, 1997, president bill clinton declared guam a federal disaster area making it eligible for federal assistance.20 one week later a disaster declaration was ordered for the northern mariana Islands.21 ultimately fema received 14,770Individual assistance applications from residents on guam in turn fema provided the residents with over in assistance 2015USD.22 the entire island of guam was left without power after paka water and sewage systems on guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon with the usage of power generators most areas of the island had water pumping capabilities within a few days after the typhoon the antonio b won pat international airport was partially reopened to daytime flights a day after the typhoon and by a week after the passage of paka the airport was fully re-opened.15  retirementedit  due to the heavy damage from the typhoon the central pacific hurricane center requested the retirement of the name in april 2006 the name paka was replaced with Pama.23  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  199798 el nio event  list of off-season pacific hurricanes  typhoon gay  typhoon
