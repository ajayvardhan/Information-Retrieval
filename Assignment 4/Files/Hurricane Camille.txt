alabama mississippi louisiana southern united states midwestern united states eastern seaboard  part of the 1969 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane camille was the second-most intense tropical cyclone to strike the united states on record the most intense storm of the 1969 atlantic hurricane season camille formed as a tropical depression on august 14 south of cuba from a long-tracked tropical wave located in a favorable environment for strengthening the storm quickly intensified into a Category2 hurricane before striking the western part of the nation on august 15. emerging into the gulf of mexico camille underwent another period of rapid intensification and became a Category5 hurricane the next day as it moved northward towards the louisianamississippi region despite weakening slightly on august 17, the hurricane quickly re-intensified back to a category 5 before it made landfall in waveland mississippi early on august 18 with a pressure of 900mbar this was the second-lowest pressure recorded for a us landfall only the 1935 labor day hurricane had a lower pressure at landfall as camille pushed inland it quickly weakened and was a tropical depression by the time it was over the ohio valley once it emerged offshore it was able to restrengthen to a strong tropical storm before it became extratropical being absorbed by a cold front over the north atlantic on august 22.  camille caused tremendous damage in its wake and also produced a peak official storm surge of 24 feet the hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the us state of mississippi and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the appalachian mountains of virginia in total camille killed 259people and caused usd equivalent to 2016USD2 in damages to

tropical wave off the western coast of africa on August5, 1969. it tracked quickly westward along the 15th parallel north,3 a tropical disturbance became clearly identifiable on satellite imagery on August9. by that time the thunderstorm activity concentrated into a circular area of convection the next day it moved through the lesser antilles although there was no evidence of a closed circulation on August13, the wave passed near or over the southern coast of jamaica as its convection spread northeastward through the bahamas subsequently it began a slower motion to the northwest it is believed that a tropical depression formed shortly thereafter early on August14, and it became a tropical storm a few hours later on the morning of August14, the hurricane hunters flew to investigate for a closed circulation near the bahamas as well as near the cayman Islands.4 the crew observed a developing center in the western caribbean and winds had reached tropical storm status by then the storm had strengthened into a strong tropical storm with winds of 60mph about 50 miles west-northwest of grand Cayman.45  upon first being classified as a tropical storm camille was located in an area favorable for further strengthening although initially it slowly intensified it was located within an area of very light wind shear and an overall warm environment additionally the storm developed strong low-level inflow from the deep southern caribbean which continuously brought moisture into the storm.4 throughout its duration it was a small tropical cyclone although with a radius of gale-force winds spreading 100 miles to the north the storms thunderstorm area quickly spread over cuba as the storm approached the western coast of cuba it began rapid deepening reaching hurricane status and less than 12hours later attained winds of 110mph prior to landfall its eye was tracked by radar from havana it is estimated the hurricane moved ashore between cape san antonio and guane late on August15 as a strong category 2 hurricane camille was a small hurricane as it crossed western cuba and its winds decreased slightly to 105mph over land before it emerged into the gulf of Mexico.5  this new orleans radar image of hurricane camille was taken less than 50miles from its center on August17 1969 at 10 pm cst  initially hurricane camille was forecast to turn northeastward toward the florida panhandle instead it continued northwestward and rapidly intensified once again almost immediately after leaving cuba its eye contracted to a diameter of less than 8 miles and strong rainbands developed around the entire hurricane due to the small eye hurricane hunters at first had difficulties in obtaining the strength however a flight late on August16 found a strong category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale and recorded a very low pressure of 908mbar 26.82inHg, with winds estimated at 175mph at the time it was not expected to intensify further.5 however a subsequent hurricane hunters flight early on 17 august recorded a pressure of 905mbar 26.73inHg, at the time the lowest pressure recorded by reconnaissance aircraft that made camille the most intense hurricane since the 1935 labor day hurricane currently it is the sixth most intense atlantic hurricane as ranked by lowest pressure at the same time maximum wind speeds in the hurricane peaked at 175mph by 00 utc on August17.67  as it continued toward the gulf coast of the united states camille maintained its small eye and forecasters continued to anticipate a turn toward Florida.5 late on August17, camille briefly weakened to a category 4 storm due to an eyewall replacement cycle a reconnaissance flight was forced to end its mission early due to a damaged engine.4 before they left the storm the crew recorded a pressure of 919mbar 27.14inHg and estimated surface winds at 155mph while camille was located about 100 miles southeast of the mississippi river Delta.5 there were no subsequent hurricane hunter flights but surface observations recorded later suggested that camille quickly re-strengthened and regained category 5 intensity after passing very near southeastern louisiana hurricane camille made landfall early on August18 in waveland Mississippi.6 maximum wind speeds near the coastline were estimated to have been about 175mph with a pressure of 900mbar 26.58inHg.4  the hurricane weakened as it progressed inland and within 14 hours of moving ashore camille weakened to tropical storm status about 12 hours later it weakened to tropical depression status by which time it began a turn to the north and northeast on August20, tropical depression camille turned eastward through kentucky dropping heavy rainfall in west virginia and virginia later that day it emerged into the atlantic ocean east of norfolk and by that afternoon as it was emerging offshore it regained tropical storm status camille accelerated east-northeastward attaining peak winds of 70mph as it interacted with larger hurricane debbie to its southeast the poor sampling of the region means that it is possible that the storm may have regained hurricane intensity in a location where measurements of wind speed were not taken.4 subsequently camille began to interact with a cold front causing it to gradually change into an extratropical cyclone as it entrained cooler air on August22, camille was absorbed by the cold front to the south of atlantic Canada.45  preparationsedit  national hurricane center track forecasts for camille from western cuba onward the systems actual track is marked by the line farthest to the west  shortly after camille formed the national hurricane center advised residents on the isle of pines and in western cuba to prepare for gale-force winds heavy rains and rising tides the agency also recommended small boats to remain in harbor.5 the threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate thousands along the western coast of cuba and on the isle of pines on the island 10,000cattle and 6,000turkeys were moved to safer areas.8  as camille impacted cuba small craft were advised not to venture out too far from the coasts of Florida.9  on 15 august the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for a 110 miles stretch of land in florida between apalachicola and fort walton beach the next day as these hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning thousands of people boarded up their homes and evacuated inland during the afternoon of 16 august the weather bureau ordered that a hurricane watch should be placed in force for the coastline from biloxi to st marks florida later that day the hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwestern florida coast from fort walton to st markscitation needed  by saturday morning a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from biloxi eastward civil defense organizations in coastal counties went on alert keesler air force base and the naval construction battalion center prepared for the storm by 5 pm on sunday a hurricane warning was issued for the coast this activated the national guard units many refused to believe the reports concerning camilles intensity that afternoon many people living at elevations of 20 feet above sea level refused to believe they were going to be submerged the mayor of gulfport ordered the release of prisoners from the city jail as winds increased at 9 pm on sunday evening but none would leave.10  impactedit  most severe landfalling atlantic hurricanes in the united states

making landfall in waveland mississippi as a Category5 hurricane,6 camille caused damage and destruction across much of the gulf coast of the united states because it moved quickly through the region hurricane camille dropped only moderate precipitation in most areas areas in and around pass christian its point of landfall reported from 7 to 10 inches to 250mm.12 the area of total destruction in harrison county mississippi was 68 square miles the total estimated cost of damage was usd 2017USD.14 this made camille the second-most expensive hurricane in the united states up to that point hurricane Betsy.15 the storm directly killed 143people along alabama mississippi and louisiana an additional 153people perished as a result of catastrophic flooding in nelson county virginia and other areas nearby in all 8,931people were injured 5,662 homes were destroyed and 13,915 homes experienced major damage with many of the fatalities being coastal residents who had refused to evacuate  caribbean and offshore gulf of mexicoedit  as a developing tropical storm camille brought rain showers to grand cayman although there were no reports of damage.5 stations in cuba on the outer fringes of the storm reported winds of 50mph east of where it moved ashore the city of guane recorded winds of 92mph although no wind reports were taken in the landfall location the hurricane produced up to 10 inches near guane as well as on the isle of Pines.5 on the isle of pines the storm inflicted damage to about 100houses.8 throughout pinar del ro province camille caused heavy damage,16 primarily from river flooding17 about 20,000people were left homeless in the province strong winds downed trees and power lines which caused power outages eastward through the capital city of havana initially the government reported no casualties from the storm.16 subsequent research indicated the hurricane killed five people in the country during its passage and damage was estimated at  in the days after the storm struck cuba the government deployed medical teams to affected regions to provide typhoid vaccine shots officials noted the potential for the spread of disease due to flooding from camille as well as previously wet conditions.8  in the open gulf of mexico the hurricane produced wave heights of at least 70 feet as measured by shell oil company along the ocean floor the storm created mudslides which lowered the ocean floor its combination with strong waves and winds destroyed three oil platforms including one that at the time was the deepest oil well property damages to the offshore oil industry were initially estimated at  louisianaedit  the eastbound lanes of heavily traveled united states us highway 90 suffered broken pavement during hurricane camille which halted traffic  the pressure fell to 27.80 inches of mercury at garden island winds gusted to 125 miles per hour at slidell as their pressure sank to 28.75 inches of mercury on 19 august almost total destruction was seen from venice to buras ostrica lock measured a storm surge of 16 feet water overwashed us highway 90 to a depth of 10 feet the highest rainfall report from the state was 5.23 inches from Slidell.21 camille caused about million dollars of damage in Louisiana.4 fortunately the storm turned just in time to avoid a direct hit to the city of new orleans which was devastated just four years prior by hurricane betsy the worst effects in new orleans proper were flooding from some levees particularly in the lowest lying areas including the lower ninth ward which suffered the most severe flooding during betsy  mississippiedit  ships beached in gulfport mississippi  in mississippi camille was significantly worse than hurricane betsy and a september 1947 hurricane electricity went out during camilles approach to the mississippi coastline united states highway 90 flooded as a large storm surge overtopped seawalls leaving a barge along the highway in gulfport fires consumed coastal communities with the exceptions of bay st louis and waveland camille destroyed the antebellum trinity episcopal church in pass christian taking 15 lives the dixie white house where president woodrow wilson and his family once stayed was badly damaged in biloxi mississippi the storm surge reached the second floor of the structure.10 the highest rainfall total recorded was 10.06 inches at the mississippi test Facility.21 mississippi received the worst of the damage upon making landfall camille produced a 24 foot storm surge along mississippis entire shore and for some three to four blocks inland the destruction was nearly complete the worst hit areas were clermont harbor lakeshore waveland bay st louis pass christian long beach and the beach front of gulfport mississippi city and biloxi one of frank lloyd wrights waterfront houses for w l fuller in pass christian was completely destroyed.22  more than 11 inches of rain occurred in hancock county and most low-lying areas were flooded with up to 15 feet of water us highway 90, which is close to the shore was broken up in many areas and sand and debris blocked much of it totals say that 3,800 homes and businesses were completely destroyed as camille came ashore it passed over ship island off the coast of mississippi camilles strong storm surge and torrential rains literally split the island in two the body of water between west ship island and east ship island is now called cut camille had significant ecological effects in the gulf coast region a barrier island chain off the coast of mississippi and 70 of dauphin island were completely inundated by the storms surge.23 camille caused about million dollars of damage in Mississippi.4  hurricane partyedit  richelieu apartments before camille  richelieu apartments after camille  one persistent account about camille states that 23 people held a party on the third floor of the richelieu manor apartments in pass christian mississippi in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall the high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building killing all but one person who the survivor is how many party guests there were and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling an abc made-for-tv movie called hurricane starring frank sutton of gomer pyle usmc larry hagman patrick duffy will geer martin milner and michael learned was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party however the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie as was the name of the hurricane the television show quantum leap carried an episode regarding the parties of hurricane camille and the actual hurricane itself twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the richelieu apartments during the hurricane eight of whom died the tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor mary ann Gerlach.10 survivor ben duckworth has expressed irritation at the story there was no hurricane party duckworth reiterated in 2001. we were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars we were too tired to party i cant tell you why that story persists or why people didnt put two and two together i guess the hurricane party makes a good story.24  the site of the richelieu apartments the corner of henderson avenue and us 90 in pass christian later became a shopping center coincidentally it was destroyed by hurricane katrina  alabama and floridaedit  alabama also experienced damage along us highway 90 26,000 homes and over 1,000 businesses were wiped out completely across the state of alabama camilles large circulation also resulted in a 3-to-5-foot to 1.52m storm surge in apalachicola florida the highest rainfall report received within alabama was 6.52 inches two miles northeast of Fairhope.21 camille caused about million dollars of damage in Alabama.4 places farther east across the western florida panhandle saw lesser rains as 4.16 inches was measured at pensacola naval air Station.25  ohio valley and west virginiaedit  camille storm total rainfall  camille caused moderate rainfall in tennessee and kentucky of between 3 and 5 inches helping to relieve a drought in the area yet in westvirginia there was flash flooding which destroyed 36 houses and 12 trailers a total of three quarters of a million dollars in damage.27  virginiaedit  because the hurricane was expected to quickly dissipate over land few were prepared for the flash flooding.28 arriving in virginia on the evening of August19, camille was no longer a hurricane but it carried high amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture  a widespread area of western and central virginia received over 8 inches of rain from camilles remains leading to significant flooding across the state a total of 153 people lost their lives from blunt trauma sustained during mountain slides related to the flash flooding not drowning.29 more than 123 of these deaths including 21 members of one family the huffmans were in nelson county debris avalanches occurred on hillsides with a slope greater than 35percent.29 in nelson county the number of deaths amounted to over one percent of the countys population.30 the worst of the damage was reported in massies mill woods mill roseland bryant tyro montebello lovingston norwood rockfish and along the davis and muddy creeks.29 the james and tye rivers crested well above flood stage in many areas including a record high of 41.3 feet at columbia virginia hurricane camille caused more than million of damage dollars in Virginia.45 camille was considered one of the worst natural disasters in central virginias recorded history.29  flooding damage at howardsville virginia the bridge formerly carried virginia route 626 over the rockfish river  the storm dropped torrential rainfall of 12 to 20 inches to 510mm, with a maximum of 27 inches most of the rainfall occurred in virginia during a 3-5hour period on 1920 august five plus inches of rain fell near the north fork of the tye river in only half an hour with the grounds already saturated from previous rains.28 many rivers flooded across the state with the worst being the james river in richmond with a peak crest of 28.6 feet many rivers in virginia and west virginia set records for peak flood stages causing numerous mudslides along mountainsides in the mountain slopes between charlottesville and lynchburg more than 26 inches of rain fell in 12 hours but the worst was in nelson county where 27 inches fell there rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees cows floating down the hatt creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge though the official rainfall was recorded as 27 inches unofficial estimates are much greater some estimate that more than 40 inches of rain fell at davis creek most gauges were washed away however it was reported that an empty 55 gallon drum that was not even in the center of the heaviest rainfall had 31 inches of water in it after camille passed.31 much rain fell in such a short time in nelson county that according to the national weather service at the time it was probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible  the ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153people. in nelson county alone 133 bridges washed out while in some places entire communities were under water.27  the major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communication between richmond and the shenandoah valley waynesboro on the south river saw eight feet of water downtown and buena vista had more than five feet  throughout virginia camille destroyed 313 houses 71 trailers and 430 farm buildings 3,765 families were affected by the hurricane in the area and total damage in the state amounted to 2005USD.14283334

its landfalling pressure the only hurricane to hit the united states with a lower pressure at landfall was the labor day hurricane of 1935.636 a reconnaissance flight indicated a pressure of 901 millibars but this pressure was later corrected in 1969 by researchers to 919mb the wind speed of camille can only be approximated as no meteorological equipment survived the extreme conditions at landfall but camille is estimated to have had sustained winds of 190mph at landfall with gusts exceeding 230mph although a reanalysis in april 2014 concluded that camille had maximum winds of 175mph rather than the 190 beforehand before hurricane katrina in 2005, camille likely had the highest storm surge measured in the united states at over 24 feet  the 24-foot storm surge quoted by the army corps of engineers was based on high-water marks inside surviving buildings of which there were but three prior to the collapse of the richelieu apartments ben duckworth shone a flashlight down a stairwell and found the water within one step of the third-story floor this establishes a surge height of 28 feet at that spot at that time about 15minutes later the building collapsed and the evidence vanished with it  in addition camille forced the mississippi river to flow backwards for a river-distance of 125miles its mouth to a point north of new orleans the river further backed up for an additional 120 miles to a point north of baton Rouge.39  in 1969 the naming conventions for hurricanes were not strictly controlled as they are today there were only three requirements the name had

and local agencies and volunteer organizations the main organization for coordinating the federal response to the disaster was the office of emergency preparedness which provided 2005USD14 to administer and coordinate disaster relief programs food and shelter were available the day after the storm on 19 august parts of mississippi and louisiana were declared major disaster areas and became eligible for federal disaster relief funds.40 president richard m nixon ordered 1450 regular troops and 800 united states army engineers into the area to bring tons of food vehicles and aircraft.10 large organizations contributing to the relief effort included the federal power commission which helped fully return power to affected areas by 25 november 1969. the coast guard under the department of transportation air force army army corps of engineers navy seabees and marine corps all helped with evacuations search and rescue clearing debris and distribution of food the department of defense contributed 2005USD14 and 16,500military troops overall to the recovery the department of health provided 4million dollars towards medicine vaccines and other health related needs.40  on monday the air national guard and those at keesler air force base airlifted patients to jackson and other more inland locations volunteers searched for those injured and dead as well as helping refugees when many of the evacuees returned by tuesday governor john bell williams declared martial law blocking highways into the area and leading to a 6 pm to 6 am curfew the governor also opened camp shelby dormitories within the university of southern mississippi and the robert e lee hotel to serve as shelters for those who lost homes sections of bay st louis and pass christian were evacuated survivors

military presence would continue for several weeks during the evening of 8 september president nixon visited the biloxi-gulfport regional airport and gave a speech to elevate the spirits of local residents struggling with the storms aftermath during the rebuilding process stricter building codes were enforced by local governments in 1973, hurricane hunters and their associated reconnaissance aircraft relocated to keesler air force base when their previous headquarters at ramey puerto rico closed.10  a large antebellum mansion destroyed by the high winds and storm surge  long-term redevelopment was overseen by the department of commerce which contributed 2005USD14 towards planned and coordinated redevelopment of affected areas noaa weather radio was expanded to coastal locations during the 1970s in the wake of camille based upon recommendations made by the department of commerce in september 1969.41  the devastation of camille inspired the implementation of the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after the storm many gulf coast residents commented that hurricane warnings were not clear enough in conveying the expected intensity of the coming storm the saffir-simpson scale offered a much more concise statement of storm intensity than barometric pressure and wind-speed measurements and veterans of previous hurricanes could analogize the power of the approaching storm to those they had experienced.42  in a 1999 report on hurricane camille sponsored by the noaa coastal services center the authors concluded camille the preparations for the event and the response were based on processes put in place long before the storm made landfall coordination between government agencies as well as with state and local officials was enhanced because of preexisting plans.40  one small compensation was that recovery from flood damage in nelson county virginia led to the discovery of the ginger gold apple in the orchards of clyde Harvey.43  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  due to the major destruction and death in much of the southern united states the name camille was retired after the 1969 season,44 and will never again be used for an atlantic or gulf hurricane or tropical storm the name cindy was scheduled to replace the name in 1973,45 although a new ten-year list of names was created for the 1972-1980 atlantic hurricane seasons.46  comparisons to hurricane katrinaedit  see also hurricane katrina  comparison of hurricanes camille and katrina on satellite imagery  although hurricane camille and hurricane katrina took different paths they both reached the same section of the coast of mississippi with similar destructive effects camille intensified more rapidly than katrina and unlike katrina camille re-intensified a second time and maintained status as a category 5 hurricane until landfall both hurricanes shared the common aspect of undergoing periods of rapid intensification.47 the size of camilles radius of maximum wind was less than one-third that of katrina more similar to the intense but small hurricane andrew also unlike katrina camille caused little damage in new orleans louisiana though camille itself just barely missed the city.48 the area of hurricane-force winds within camille was just over two-thirds the size of hurricane katrina both storms were moving at a similar forward motion at the time of landfall although camilles wind speed at landfall was higher katrinas storm surge exceeded camilles storm surge at all known locations due to its greater size.49 both hurricanes names were retired due to the time period between the two hurricanes along with the approximate same landfall locations sizes and intensities of the two storms katrina had been nicknamed deadly daughter  in cultureedit  filmsedit  a lady called camille created by the us department of agriculture shortly after the hurricane shows preparation and recovery efforts organized
