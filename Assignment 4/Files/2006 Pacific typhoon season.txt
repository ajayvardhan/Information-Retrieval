though most tropical cyclones typically develop between may and october the seasons first named storm chanchu developed on may 9, while the seasons last named storm trami dissipated on december 20. this season was also much active costly and deadly than the previous season  throughout the season many typhoons made landfall at a higher intensity typhoon saomai was the most powerful typhoon to strike china for over 50 years as a category 4 typhoon responsible for over 400 deaths typhoon shanshan struck japan and became the costliest typhoon this season with a total damage of about billion the philippines got hit by a total of six typhoons which saw the highest number since 1974. all six typhoons were responsible for over 1,000 casualties and several millions of damages typhoon ioke which formed from the central pacific entered the basin and became the strongest central pacific hurricane moreover it was stated that the ratio of intense typhoons was 0.73, which was the highest since 1970.1  the scope of this article is limited to the pacific ocean to the north of the equator between 100E and 180th meridian within the northwestern pacific ocean there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names the japan meteorological agencyjma will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65kmh anywhere in the basin whilst the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administrationpagasa assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135E and 115E and between 5N25N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given

agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies included the tropical storm risktsr consortium of university college london pagasa and taiwans central weather bureau some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the la nia conditions that were observed during the previous year  on march 7, tropical storm risk issued its first forecast for the season at an extended-range forecasting a close to average season of 27 tropical storms 17 typhoons and 8 intense typhoons the ace predicted was around 298.3 by may 5, tropical storm risk issued their second forecast for the season raising their numbers to 29 tropical storms 19 typhoons and 9 intense typhoons with an ace of 326. this is due to the observed warming of sea-surface temperatures in the nio 3.75 region and current patterns within the central pacific indicating slightly higher activity.2 tsr released its third forecast for the season on june 7, predicting the same numbers with the same reason though on their fourth forecast during july 5, tsr stated that the 2006 season will be 15 above the 19652005 norm therefore they raised the number of intense typhoons to 10, and their ace to 349. the other reason behind this is due to the fact that there was an increase in tropical activity and much warmer ssts over in the nio 3.75 region than the previous forecast.5 on august 4, tsr released their final forecast they reduced the number of intense typhoons to 9, and the ace to 325. this was because it was reported that a slight decrease in tropical activity from the previous forecast and is due solely of a slight decrease in ssts over in the same region.6  seasonal summaryedit  tracks of typhoons that affected the philippines during late 2006  the pacific typhoon season runs throughout 2006 and has no official bounds though most tropical cyclones from this basin generally develops from the months from may through to october despite the season turned out to be active most tropical cyclones developed during the second half of the year with only one typhoon chanchu developing during the month of may some minor systems also developed before may with the first tropical system of the year agaton developing to the east of philippines on january 20, bringing minor damages as it crossed the country few days later.7  tropical cyclogenesis had become much favorable during late june with formations of jelawat and ewiniar it

shear more convection and warmer water as three simultaneous storms maria saomai and bopha formed and affected three different landmasses such as japan china and taiwan respectively later in the same month hurricane ioke had entered the basin from the central pacific as the strongest central pacific storm in recorder history as a category 5 powerful storm.9  on september an unnamed and unclassified tropical storm have been discovered by meteorologist gary padgett and dr karl hoarau later typhoon xangsane affected luzon philippines causing major damages with more than 200 people dead.10 the country saw four storms making landfall with three of them reaching category 4 or 5 super typhoon status typhoon cimaron made landfall over in northern luzon as a category 5 super typhoon with minimal damages.11 by november typhoon chebi made landfall in the same area as cimaron though effects from the typhoon were much smaller than cimaron although by late november typhoon durian made landfall in bicol region combined effects with ash from the mayon volcano had killed over 1,500 people and damgaes at least US530 million durian also crossed the basin and into the north indian ocean basin the first time since 2003. during early december two systems formed typhoon utor crossed visayas with minimal damage and tropical storm trami a very weak system that didnt affect any landmasses

an anticyclone to the north and a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the west provided outflow for the system.11 soulik tracked northwestward around a ridge slowly intensifying due to wind
