this is a list of notable pacific hurricanes subdivided by reason for notability notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impacts  characteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the saffirsimpson scale cyclogenesis outside of a normal hurricane seasons timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960. another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation these include the cost of damage the

in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the a name each year.33 that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year.34  named storms per monthedit  four of the july cyclones during the 2016 season  before 1971 and especially 1966, data in this basin is extremely

pacific hurricane east of the international dateline  this lists all pacific hurricanes that existed as tropical cyclones while in the pacific ocean east of the dateline for more than two weeks continuously hurricanes john and dora spent some time in the west pacific before dissipating john spent eleven days west of the dateline if that time was included john would have existed for a total of 30days and 18hours, a world record while including doras time in the west pacific would mean that it existed for 18 days.35 one atlantic hurricane hurricane joan crossed into this basin and was renamed Miriam,45 giving it a total lifespan of 22days,46 but not all of that was in the pacific 1993s greg formed from the remnants of 1993s tropical storm Bret.45 its time as an atlantic system is excluded  all of these systems except trudy olaf and connie existed in both the east and central pacific and all except olaf were hurricanes hurricane trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern pacific tropical storm olaf of 1997 is hence the longest-lived eastern pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensity.35  no known tropical cyclone

in the central pacific subtropics it eventually developed an eye-like structure.85 its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east pacific because it formed at longitude 149W and dissipated at 135W.86 nasa which is not a meteorological organization called this system a subtropical cyclone and the naval research laboratory monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91C.85 the system has also been called extratropical.87 this cyclone is unofficial because it is not included in the seasonal reports of either regional specialized meteorological Center.8889  intensity
