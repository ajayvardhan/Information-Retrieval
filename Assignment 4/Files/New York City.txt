city was named after then duke of york and future king of england james ii james had been named by his older brother charles ii as proprietor of the former territory of new netherlands and its main city of new amsterdam which had recently been seized from the dutch  early history  during the wisconsinan glaciation the new york city region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet in depth the ice sheet scraped away large amounts of regolith leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of new york city today later on movement of the ice sheet would contribute to the separation of what are now long island and staten Island.81  in the precolonial era the area of present-day new york city was inhabited by various bands of algonquian tribes of native americans including the lenape whose homeland known as lenapehoking included staten island the western portion of long island including the area that would become brooklyn and queens manhattan the bronx and the lower hudson Valley.82  the first documented visit into new york harbor by a european was in 1524 by giovanni da verrazzano a florentine explorer in the service of the french crown he claimed the area for france and named it nouvelle angoulme Angoulme.83  peter minuit is credited with the purchase of the island of manhattan in 1626.  a spanish expedition led by captain estvo gomes a portuguese sailing for emperor charles v arrived in new york harbor in january 1525 charted the mouth of the hudson river which he named ro de san antonio anthonys river heavy ice kept him from further exploration and he returned to spain in august the padrn real of 1527, the first scientific map to show north americas east coast continuously was informed by gomes expedition and labeled the northeastern us as tierra de esteban gmez in his honor.84  in 1609, the english explorer henry hudson rediscovered the new york harbor while searching for the northwest passage to the orient for the dutch east india company he proceeded to sail up what the dutch would name the north river the hudson river named first by hudson as the mauritius after maurice prince of orange hudsons first mate described the harbor as very good harbour for all windes and the river as mile broad and of fish.85 hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north,86 past the site of present-day albany in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.85 he made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the dutch east india company in 1614, the area between cape cod and delaware bay would be claimed by the netherlands and called nieuw-nederland netherland  the first non-native american inhabitant of what would eventually become new york city was juan rodriguez to dutch as jan rodrigues a merchant from santo domingo born in santo domingo of portuguese and african descent he arrived in manhattan during the winter of 16131614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the dutch broadway from 159th street to 218th street in upper manhattan is named juan rodriguez way in his honor.8788  new amsterdam

guilders93 in 2006.94 a disproved legend claims that manhattan was purchased for worth of glass beads.9596  following the purchase new amsterdam grew slowly.97 to attract settlers the dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy dutchmen or patrons who brought 50 colonists to new netherland would be awarded swathes of land along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade this program had little success.98  since 1621, the dutch west india company had operated as a monopoly in new netherland on authority granted by the dutch states general in 16391640, in an effort to bolster economy growth the dutch west india company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade leading to growth in the production and trade of food timber tobacco and slaves with the dutch west Indies.9799  in 1647, peter stuyvesant began his tenure as the last director-general of new netherland during his tenure the population of new amsterdam grew from 2,000 to 8,000. stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony however he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader he instituted regulations on liquor sales

orange after william iii the prince of orange the dutch would soon return the island to england under the treaty of westminster of november 1674.105106  several intertribal wars among the native americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the europeans caused sizable population losses for the lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.107 by 1700, the lenape population had diminished to 200.108 new york experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.109110  new york grew in importance as a trading

fierce competition for a decade between irish immigrants and black people for work rioters burned the colored orphan asylum to the ground with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of
