toxin  from toxins  this article is about the class of poisonous substances for other uses see toxin  a toxin ancientgreek toxikon is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or organisms12 synthetic toxicants created by artificial processes are thus excluded the term was first used by organic chemist ludwig brieger  toxins can be small molecules peptides or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors toxins vary greatly in their toxicity ranging from usually minor as a bee sting to almost immediately deadly as botulinum toxin  contents  1 terminology  2 biotoxins  3 environmental toxins  3.1 finding information about toxins  3.2 computational

their method of productionthe word toxin does not specify method of delivery with venom and the broader meaning of poisonall substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms it simply means it is a biologically produced poison there was an ongoing terminological dispute between nato and the warsaw pact over whether to call a toxin a biological or chemical agent in which the nato opted for biological agent and the warsaw pact like most other countries in the world for chemical agentcitation needed  according to an international committee of the red cross review of the biological weapons convention are poisonous products of organisms unlike biological agents they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves and the signing of the constitition there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins.4  according to title 18 of the united states code the term means the toxic material or product of plants animals microorganisms but not limited to bacteria viruses fungi rickettsiae or protozoa or infectious substances or a recombinant or synthesized molecule whatever their origin and method of production...5  a rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable  hemotoxin causes destruction of red blood cells  phototoxin causes dangerous photosensitivity  on a broader scale toxins may be classified as either exotoxins being excreted by an organism or endotoxins that are released mainly when bacteria are lysed  biotoxinsedit  the term is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin.67 biotoxins are further classified into fungal biotoxins or short mycotoxins microbial biotoxins plant biotoxins short phytotoxins and animal biotoxins  toxins produced by microorganisms are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity andor evasion of the host immune response.8  biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism and can be highly complex venom of the cone snail contains dozens of small proteins each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor or relatively small protein  biotoxins in nature have two primary functions  predation in the spider snake scorpion jellyfish wasp  defense in the bee ant termite honeybee wasp poison dart frog  some of the more well known types of biotoxins include  cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria  dinotoxins produced by dinoflagellates  necrotoxins cause necrosis death in the cells they encounter and destroy all types of tissuecitation needed necrotoxins spread through the bloodstreamcitation needed in humans skin and muscle tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxinscitation needed organisms that possess necrotoxins include  the brown recluse or back spider  most rattlesnakes and vipers produce phospholipase and various trypsin-like serine proteases  puff adder  necrotizing fasciitis by the eating bacterium streptococcus pyogenes produces a pore forming toxin  neurotoxins primarily affect the nervous systems of animals the group neurotoxins generally consists of ion channel toxins that disrupt ion channel conductance organisms that possess neurotoxins include  the black widow spider  most scorpions  the box jellyfish  elapid snakes  the cone snail  the blue-ringed octopus  venomous fish  frogs  palythoa coral  various different types of algae cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates  myotoxins are small basic peptides found in snake and lizard venoms they cause muscle tissue damage by a non enzymatic receptor based mechanism organisms that possess myotoxins include  rattlesnakes  eastern bearded dragon  cytotoxins are toxic at the level of individual cells either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells  ricin from castor beans  apitoxin from honey bees  T-2 mycotoxin from certain toxic mushrooms  environmental toxinsedit  the term toxin can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants9 such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances as this contradicts most formal definitions of the term it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts  environmental toxins from food chains that may be dangerous to human health include  paralytic shellfish poisoning  amnesic shellfish poisoning  diarrheal shellfish poisoning  neurotoxic shellfish poisoning  finding information about toxinsedit  the toxicology and environmental health information program at the united states national library of medicine maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web  toxmap is a geographic information system that is part of toxnet toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agencys toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs  computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteinsedit  one of the bottlenecks in peptideprotein-based therapy is their toxicity recently in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins developed by gajendra pal singh raghavas group,22 predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server.23  misuse of the termedit  when used non-technically the term is often applied to any toxic substance even though the term toxicant would be more appropriate toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed poisons and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to toxic substances in generalclarification needed  in the context of quackery and alternative medicine the term is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health this could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous pesticides to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation to food ingredients such as table sugar monosodium glutamate and aspartame.24  see alsoedit  arachnoserver  brevetoxin  cangitoxin  detoxification medicine  excitotoxicity  insect toxins  list of fictional toxins  list of highly
