hurricane to strike the west coast of mexico in recorded history.1 kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression thirteenth tropical storm seventh hurricane sixth major hurricane and third category 5 hurricane of the 2002 pacific hurricane season after forming on october 22 to the south of mexico from a tropical wave forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it actually did moving into an area of favorable upper-level conditions and warm sea surface temperatures kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph on october 25 while located about 255mi southwest of puerto vallarta jalisco weakening as it turned to the northeast the hurricane struck near san blas nayarit with winds of 140mph before dissipating on october 26 over the sierra madre occidental mountains  the name was retired from the list of pacific hurricane names due to its effects on mexico which included US101million in damage and four deaths the worst of the hurricanes effects occurred between san blas in nayarit and puerto vallarta in jalisco where over 100people were injured and thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed 95 of the buildings in san blas were damaged and hundreds of buildings were destroyed along coastal areas of puerto vallarta  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  4 retirement aftermath and records  5

traced to a tropical wave moving westward through the caribbean sea on october 16, possibly the same wave that passed near barbados two days earlier the wave entered the eastern pacific ocean on october 19, and a tropical disturbance along the wave axis gradually became better organized conditions favored continued development and dvorak classifications began late on october 20. early on october 22, the system developed into tropical depression fourteen-e while located about 375mi south of manzanillo Colima.1 initially the depression was disorganized with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by 60hours as such the national hurricane center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of 45mph before weakening.2  the depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center and six hours after forming it strengthened into tropical storm kenna upper-level outflow and banding features improved in organization as well with warm water temperatures of over 29C and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear forecasters predicted kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of 85mph within 72hours of october 22.3 the storm moved to the west-northwest around the periphery of a mid-level high-pressure system and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands on october 23, the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center which coincided with a steady increase in strength late on october 23, kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about 380mi southwest of Manzanillo.1  shortly after becoming a hurricane kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17mi wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast.4 early on october 24 kenna became a major hurricane and in a 24hour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70mph winds to 145mph after turning to the north and northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough kenna attained peak winds of 165mph early on october 25 while located about 255mi southwest of puerto vallarta the third category 5 hurricane of the season a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913mbar the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a pacific hurricane.56  quickly after peaking wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane and by six hours after reaching peak intensity the winds in hurricane kenna dropped to 150mph after the eye nearly dissipated despite a 27mbar increase in pressure in 12hours, convective activity increased prior to kenna making landfall on october 25 hurricane kenna struck near san blas in the state of nayarit with estimated winds of 140mph the hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western mexico and the circulation dissipated on october 26 over the sierra madre occidental mountains the remnants continued northeastward into the gulf of mexico and southeastern united States.1  preparationsedit  hurricane kenna rainfall in mexico  about 27hours before landfall mexican officials issued a hurricane watch from mazatln to cabo corrientes jalisco with a tropical storm watch issued further south to manzanillo six hours later when its track became more apparent the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from mazatln to la fortuna with a tropical storm warning southward to Manzanillo.1  roughly 8,800 of the 9,000 residents in the landfall location san blas evacuated which ultimately contributed to a low death toll.1 officials ordered for the evacuation of 50,000 residents and fishermen along the southwest coast of mexico including 3,000 in the islas Maras,7 10,000 near mazatln and 15,000 near flood-prone areas civil authorities closed all schools and docks in potentially affected areas the mexican red cross prepared for the storm by shipping 215tonnes of relief supplies such as food water clothing and medicine to the red cross branch in jalisco assistance from the yucatn peninsula delivered 10tonnes of food and water as well.8 the mexican red cross prepared 20 emergency shelters in the state of Nayarit.9 officials took security measures in los cabos baja california sur where the asia-pacific economic cooperation was meeting during the passage of the hurricane early forecasts indicated a possible threat to the meeting causing the government to prepare for a potential alternate site.7 officials recommended boats to stay at port due to severe conditions.10  impactedit  landfalling pacific major hurricanes  intensity is measured

october 25  few official surface observations are available for the passage of the hurricane upon making landfall kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16foot storm surge in san blas the surge also affected puerto vallarta with reports of 10foot waves rushing inland from the bay the hurricane dropped about 1.38inches of precipitation while passing about 60mi east of the offshore archipelago islas maras there sustained winds reached an estimated 106mph on land kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91inches at san ignacio sinaloa and 12.89inches near manzanillo Colima.20 the highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100mph at tepic nayarit with wind gusts at puerto vallarta reaching 50mph the hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in guerrero michoacn colima and jalisco and hit baja california sur with strong winds and rough seas.10  in san blas strong winds from the hurricane damaged or destroyed 95 of the homes,21 with 1,540houses damaged and 8,800people affected.22 there large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900feet inland from their docks an elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her.1 large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean.8 elsewhere in nayarit flying debris killed a person in santiago escuintla there two elderly men drowned one by falling into a river both were believed to have been killed during the storm as they fled their homes.1 in santiago ixcuintla the hurricane damaged 3,770homes,22 and throughout nayarit strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses.23 federal authorities lost communications with at least 30Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane.8 kenna destroyed the entire banana tobacco and tomato crops in the rural areas of san blas tecuala and acaponeta leaving more than 700subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food.22  in puerto vallarta about 100mi southeast of the landfall location the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US5million, primarily to hotels.1 the surge flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas and extended up to 330feet inland waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars,24 ruining several vehicles the passage of the hurricane destroyed 150stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels damage to the citys port was minor.25  the hurricane injured at least 52 in puerto Vallarta26 and dozens in san blas from widespread flying glass and other forms of debris,1 with two people seriously injured due to the hurricane ten municipalities suffered substantial damage,25 with insured damage in mexico totaling 7007960000000000000US96million.27 rainfall from the hurricane spread across northern mexico causing minor flash floods and mudslides.22  the remnants of kenna entered the south-central united states resulting in enhanced rainfall in various locations.1  retirement aftermath and recordsedit  damage in puerto vallarta  after the season had ended the world meteorological organization retired the name kenna and replaced it with Karina.28  the mexican government declared the region in nayarit near the landfall of kenna as a disaster area allowing for the usage of emergency funds.8 immediately after the passage of the hurricane the mexican red cross prepared 180technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125MT of food medicine and clothes to the areas most affected.23 the mexican government deployed the mexican army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population the mexican navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the san blas area and the government department for family development assisted the mexican red cross in delivering food grupo modelo brewers of corona beer sent 6,600gallons of drinking water and 1000food sets for the san blas area.22  backhoes and dump trucks gradually removed the debris and sand from san Blas.8 dozens of storeowners municipal employees and volunteers in puerto vallarta worked to clear the debris caused by the storm the remaining stores bars and shops placed signs on their windows describing they were open in effort to attract the tourists still in the town.25 by about two months after the hurricane most hotels restaurants and shops were reopened.29  hurricane kenna is currently tied with a hurricane in 1957 and the 1959 mexico hurricane as the third most intense pacific hurricane to strike mexico the only pacific hurricanes to strike mexico at a greater intensity were patricia of 2015 and madeline of 1976.1 kenna is the third most intense october tropical cyclone to have occurred in the east pacific and is the
