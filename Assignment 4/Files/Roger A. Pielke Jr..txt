writingedit  pielkes early work was on the space shuttle program in 1993 he argued that the shuttle was expensive and risky that it was that another orbiter would be lost within 20-35 flights.7 shortly before the loss of columbia he warned that loss of another shuttle was only a matter of time.8 he has also been critical of the space station program.9  pielke has also written extensively on climate change policy he has written that he accepts the ipcc view of the underlying science stating ipcc has concluded that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity are an important driver of changes in climate and on this basis alone i am personally convinced that it makes sense to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.10 he also states that conceivable emissions reductions policies even if successful cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades and from this he concludes that coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive.1112  on the issues of hurricanes and climate change he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors an increase in wealth density rather than change in the frequency and intensity.13  pielke has been labeled a and of climate change though pielke strongly objects to those labels.14 his views on climate change have been widely criticized by scientists including us presidential science adviser john Holdren.1516 pielke rejected holdrens criticisms saying facts are on my side,17 and several publications defended Pielke.1819 in october 2016, in a hacked email disclosed by Wikileaks,20 judd legum the editor of thinkprogress a site that is part of the center for american progress action fund states that a thinkprogress blog helped to discredit roger pielke jr and get him fired from the fivethirtyeight website.21 but the huffington post reported on this in 2014.22 fivethirtyeight published a pielke article in march 201423 that climate scientists michael mann and kevin trenberth criticized as misleading and wrong in interviews with ThinkProgress.24 the scientists said that pielke sent them threatening e-mails in response to their criticism calling it pielke responded that their characterization of his e-mails as was legum told the huffington post that he contacted nate silver the editor of fivethirtyeight which apologized to the two scientists for pielkes behavior.22 other criticisms of pielkes article followed.25 the guardian published an article by dana nuccitelli called undermines its brand by misrepresenting climate research,26 and john abraham wrote that pielkes are not taken seriously by myself and other climate scientists.27  in april 2015, pielke joined with a group of scholars in issuing an ecomodernist Manifesto.2829 the other authors were john asafu-adjaye linus blomqvist stewart brand barry brook ruth defries erle ellis christopher foreman david keith martin lewis mark lynas ted nordhaus rachel pritzker joyashree roy mark sagoff michael shellenberger robert stone and peter Teague30  grijalva investigationedit  on february 24, 2015, ranking democratic member of the united states house committee on natural resources ral grijalva sent a letter to university of colorado president bruce d benson requesting information on the sources of funding for and communications related to pielkes research and congressional testimony the letter was one of seven grijalva sent to various institutions stemming from concerns about the influence of funding from fossil fuel companies on the work and testimony of harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics researcher willie soon pielke responded that he has no funding from fossil fuel interests and characterized the letter as part of a politically motivated in response to criticism that requesting communications was counter to principles of academic freedom grijalva said he was willing to eliminate that part of the request.32  the heads of some mainstream scientific organizations criticized grijalvas letters margaret leinen the president of the american geophysical union posted in her agu blog that in requiring information only of a few scientists based only on their scientific views grivaljas action was contrary to academic freedom we view the singling out of any individual or group of scientists by any entity governmental corporate or other based solely on their interpretations of scientific research as a threat to that freedom.33 the executive director of the american meteorological society wrote in a letter to grvalja that his action sends a chilling message to all academic researchers and impinges on the free pursuit of ideas that is central to the concept of academic freedom.34  conservative columnist rich lowry editor of the national review noted in an opinion piece that not that he doubts climate change or even doubts that it could be harmful his offense is merely pointing to data showing that extreme weather events like hurricanes tornadoes and droughts havent yet been affected by climate change this is enough to enrage advocates who need immediate disasters as a handy political cudgel.35  pielke was also named in a letter sent by senator edward markey to numerous energy industry groups asking them to disclose the names of scientists they had funded regarding conflict of interest disclosures pielke said that you look at our community the failure to disclose conflicts of interest is fairly endemic.36  publicationsedit  editor with daniel sarewitz and radford byerly jr prediction science decision making and the future of nature island press new title edition 1,
