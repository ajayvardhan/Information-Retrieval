or is a central semitic language that first emerged in iron age northwestern arabia and is now the lingua franca of the arab world.5 it is named after the arabs a term initially used to describe peoples living from mesopotamia in the east to the anti-lebanon mountains in the west in northwestern arabia and in the sinai peninsula  the modern written language standard arabic is derived from classical arabic it is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces government and the media the two formal varieties are grouped together as literary arabic which is the official language of 26 states and the liturgical language of islam modern standard arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of classical arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary however it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-classical era especially in modern times  during the middle ages literary arabic was a major vehicle of culture in europe especially in science mathematics and philosophy as a result many european languages have also borrowed many words from it arabic influence mainly in vocabulary is seen in european languages mainly spanish and to a lesser extent portuguese valencian and catalan owing to both the proximity of christian european and muslim arab civilizations and 800 years of arabic culture and language in the iberian peninsula referred to in arabic as al-andalus sicilian has about 500 arabic words as result of sicily being progressively conquered by saracens from north africa from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries many of these words relate to agriculture and related activities and ruffino balkan languages including greek and bulgarian have also acquired a significant number of arabic words through contact with ottoman turkish  arabic has influenced many languages around the globe throughout its history some of the most influenced languages are persian turkish spanish maltese urdu kashmiri kurdish bosnian kazakh bengali hindi malay maldivian indonesian pashto punjabi tagalog sindhi and hausa and some languages in parts of africa conversely arabic has borrowed words from other languages including greek and persian in medieval times and contemporary european languages such as english and french in modern times  classical arabic is the liturgical language of 1.7 billion muslims and modern standard arabic is one of six official languages of the united Nations.6789 it is spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers and non-native in the arab world,2 making it the fifth most spoken language in the world arabic is written with the arabic alphabet which is an abjad script and is written from right to left although the spoken varieties

the northwest semitic languages hebrew ugaritic and phoenician the ancient south arabian languages and various other semitic languages of arabia such as dadanitic the semitic languages changed a great deal between proto-semitic and the establishment of the central semitic languages particularly in grammar innovations of the central semitic languagesall maintained in arabicinclude  the conversion of the suffix-conjugated stative formation into a past tense  the conversion of the prefix-conjugated preterite-tense formation into a present tense  the elimination of other prefix-conjugated moodaspect forms a present tense formed by doubling the middle root a perfect formed by infixing a after the first root consonant probably a jussive formed by a stress shift in favor of new moods formed by endings attached to the prefix-conjugation forms for indicative for subjunctive no ending for jussive or for energetic  the development of an internal passive  there are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hijaz these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor proto-arabic the following features can be reconstructed with confidence for Proto-Arabic10  negative particles m ln car lan  mafl g-passive participle  prepositions and adverbs f n nd t kdy  a subjunctive in  t-demonstratives  leveling of the allomorph of the feminine ending  n complementizer and subordinator  the use of f- to introduce modal clauses  independent object pronoun in  vestiges of nunation  historyedit  old arabicedit  main article old arabic  arabian languages  arabia boasted a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the ancient south arabian family southern thamudic were spoken it is also believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages semitic languages were also spoken in southern arabia at this time to the north in the oases of northern hijaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages in najd and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic finally on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d safaitic and hismaic are attested the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old Arabic.11  beginning in the 1st century ce fragments of northern old arabic are attested in the nabataean script across northern arabia by the 4th century ce the nabataean aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of arabic other than that of the nabataeans  old hijazi and classical arabicedit  in late pre-islamic times a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hijaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the hijra most strongly in judeo-christian texts keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the tradition Arabic.12 this variety and both its classicizing and iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past but they are thought to continue an old higazi register it is clear that the orthography of the qurn was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic rather it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higazi  in the late 6th century ad a relatively uniform intertribal koine distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the bedouin dialects of najd probably in connection with the court of al-ra during the first islamic century the majority of arabic poets and arabic-writing persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue their texts although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts contain traces of non-standardized classical arabic elements in morphology and syntax the standardization of classical arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century the first comprehensive description of the arabiyya sbawayhis al-kitb is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts in addition to qurn usage and bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the arabiyya.13 by the 8th century knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic world  neo-arabicedit  charles fergusons koine theory 1959 claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests this view has been challenged in recent times ahmad al-jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests northern and central 2009. the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories.13 according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and MSA.1415  classical modern standard and spoken arabicedit  see also list of arabic dictionaries  arabic usually designates one of three main variants classical arabic modern standard arabic and colloquial or dialectal arabic classical arabic is the language found in the quran used from the period of pre-islamic arabia to that of the abbasid caliphate theoretically classical arabic is considered normative according to the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians as sibawayh and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries as the lisn al-arab in practice however modern authors almost never write in pure classical arabic instead using a literary language with its own grammatical norms and vocabulary commonly known as modern standard arabic  msa is the variety used in most current printed arabic publications spoken by some of the arabic media across north africa and the middle east and understood by most educated arabic speakers arabic and arabic fu are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabic  some of the differences between classical arabic and modern standard arabic are as follows  certain grammatical constructions of ca that have no counterpart in any modern dialect the energetic mood are almost never used in modern standard arabic  no modern spoken variety of arabic has case distinctions as a result msa is generally composed without case distinctions in mind and the proper cases are added after the fact when necessary because most case endings are noted using final short vowels which are normally left unwritten in the arabic script it is unnecessary to determine the proper case of most words the practical result of this is that msa like english and standard chinese is written in a strongly determined word order and alternative orders that were used in ca for emphasis are rare in addition because of the lack of case marking in the spoken varieties most speakers cannot consistently use the correct endings in extemporaneous speech as a result spoken msa tends to drop or regularize the endings except when reading from a prepared text  the numeral system in ca is complex and heavily tied in with the case system this system is never used in msa even in the most formal of circumstances instead a significantly simplified system is used approximating the system of the conservative spoken varieties  msa uses much classical vocabulary dhahaba go that is not present in the spoken varieties but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa in addition msa has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times and msa continues to evolve.16 some words have been borrowed from other languagesnotice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation film or dmuqriyyah  however the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings preferring to either use loan translations far also used for the branch of a company or organization jan is also used for the wing of an airplane building air force etc or to coin new words using forms within existing roots istimtah using the root mwt put into the xth form or jmiah based on jamaa gather unite jumhriyyah based on jumhr an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse htif caller sufism jardah stalk  colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from classical arabic colloquial arabic has many regional variants geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be mutually unintelligible and some linguists consider them distinct languages.17 the varieties are typically unwritten they are often used in informal spoken media such as soap operas and talk shows,18 as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising  the only variety of modern arabic to have acquired official language status is maltese which is spoken in catholic malta and written with the latin script it is descended from classical arabic through siculo-arabic but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of arabic most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of arabic  flag of the arab league used in some cases for the arabic language  flag used in some cases for the arabic language  even during muhammads lifetime there were dialects of spoken arabic muhammad spoke in the dialect of mecca in the western arabian peninsula and it was in this dialect that the quran was written down however the dialects of the eastern arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time so the language of the quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern phonology it is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of classical arabic the phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of arabic writing most notably the writing of the glottal stop or hamzah was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech and the use of alif maqrah a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with in eastern speechcitation needed  language and dialectedit  the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught standard arabic as well as their native mutually unintelligible these dialects linguistically constitute separate languages which may have dialects of their own.24 when educated arabs of different dialects engage in conversation example a moroccan speaking with a lebanese many speakers code-switch back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film  the issue of whether arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged in the same way it is for the varieties of chinese hindi and urdu serbian and croatian scots and english etc in contrast to speakers of hindi and urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can speakers of the varieties of arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot.25 the issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor a single written form significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms for political reasons arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions.26  from a linguistic standpoint it is often said that the various spoken varieties of arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the romance languages.27 this is an apt comparison in a number of ways the period of divergence from a single spoken form is similarperhaps 1500 years for arabic 2000 years for the romance languages also while it is comprehensible to people from the maghreb a linguistically innovative variety such as moroccan arabic is essentially incomprehensible to arabs from the mashriq much as french is incomprehensible to spanish or italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them this suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languages  influence of arabic on other languagesedit  see also list of arabic loanwords in english  the influence of arabic has been most important in islamic countries because it is the language of the islamic sacred book the quran arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as baluchi bengali berber bosnian catalan chechen dagestani english french german gujarati hausa hindustani italian indonesian kazakh kurdish kutchi malay pashto persian portuguese punjabi rohingya saraiki sicilian sindhi somali spanish swahili tagalog turkish uzbek and wolof as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spokencitation needed  in addition english has many arabic loanwords some directly but most via other mediterranean languages examples of such words include admiral adobe alchemy alcohol algebra algorithm alkaline almanac amber arsenal assassin candy carat cipher coffee cotton ghoul hazard jar kismet lemon loofah magazine mattress sherbet sofa sumac tariff and many other wordscitation needed other languages such as Maltese28 and kinubi derive ultimately from arabic rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules  terms borrowed range from religious terminology berber taallit from salat alh academic terms uyghur mentiq and economic items english coffee to placeholders spanish fulano everyday terms hindustani lekin or spanish taza and french tasse meaning and expressions catalan a betzef in quantity most berber varieties as kabyle along with swahili borrow some numbers from arabic most islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from arabic such as and leader  in languages not directly in contact with the arab world arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from arabic for example most arabic loanwords in hindustani and turkish entered through persian though persian is an indo-iranian language older arabic loanwords in hausa were borrowed from kanuri  some words in english and other european languages are derived from arabic often through other european languages especially spanish and italian among them are commonly used words like qahwah qun and makhzin english words more recognizably of arabic origin include and  arabic words also made their way into several west african languages as islam spread across the sahara variants of arabic words such as kitb have spread to the languages of african groups who had no direct contact with arab traders.29  since throughout the islamic world arabic occupied a position similar to that of latin in europe many of the arabic concepts in the fields of science philosophy commerce etc were coined from arabic roots by non-native arabic speakers notably by aramaic and persian translators and then found their way into other languages this process of using arabic roots especially in kurdish and persian to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries when swaths of arab-inhabited lands were under ottoman rule  influence of other languages on arabicedit  the most important sources of borrowings into arabic are from the related languages Aramaic,30 which used to be the principal international language of communication throughout the ancient near and middle east ethiopic and to a lesser degree hebrew religious concepts in addition many cultural religious and political terms have entered arabic from iranian languages notably middle persian parthian and Persian,31 and hellenistic greek has as origin the greek khymia meaning in that language the melting of metals see roger dachez histoire de la mdecine de lantiquit au xxe sicle tallandier 2008, p.251, alembic from ambix almanac from almenichiakon the origin of the last three borrowed words see alfred-louis de prmare foundations of islam seuil lunivers historique 2002. some arabic borrowings from semitic or persian languages are as presented in de prmares above-cited book  madnahmedina city or city square a word of aramaic or hebrew origin which it means state  jazrah as in the well-known form means and has its origin in the syriac gazra  lzaward is taken from persian ljvard the name of a blue stone lapis lazuli this word was borrowed in several european languages to mean blue azure in english azur in french and azul in portuguese and spanish  arabic alphabet and nationalismedit  there have been many instances of national movements to convert arabic script into latin script or to romanize the language currently the only arabic language to use latin script is maltese  lebanonedit  the beirut newspaper la syrie pushed for the change from arabic script to latin letters in 1922. the major head of this movement was louis massignon a french orientalist who brought his concern before the arabic language academy in damacus in 1928. massignons attempt at romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the western world to take over their country said afghani a member of the academy mentioned that the movement to romanize the script was a zionist plan to dominate Lebanon.3233  egyptedit  after the period of colonialism in egypt egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize egyptian culture as a result some egyptians pushed for an egyptianization of the arabic language in which the formal arabic and the colloquial arabic would be combined into one language and the latin alphabet would be used.3233 there was also the idea of finding a way to use hieroglyphics instead of the latin alphabet but this was seen as too complicated to use.3233 a scholar salama musa agreed with the idea of applying a latin alphabet to arabic as he believed that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west he also believed that latin script was key to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology this change in alphabet he believed would solve the problems inherent with arabic such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn.3233 ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi two egyptian intellectuals agreed with musa and supported the push for Romanization.3234 the idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in egypt continued with abd al-aziz fahmi in 1944. he was the chairman for the writing and grammar committee for the arabic language academy of Cairo.3234 however this effort failed as the egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the arabic alphabet.3234 in particular the older egyptian generations believed that the arabic alphabet had strong connections to arab values and history which is easy to believe due to the long history of the arabic alphabet 189 in muslim societies  the language of the quran and its influence on poetryedit  the quran introduced a new way of writing to the world people began studying applying the unique styles they learned from the quran into not only their own writing but also their culture the deep level on which the quran addresses the reader creates a strong bond and connection to the readers soul writers studied the unique structure and format of the quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the reader  qurans figurative devicesedit  the quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses the arrangement of words how certain sounds create harmony and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse at times the chapters of the quran only have the rhythm in common.35  the repetition in the quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry the repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the quran the quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief metaphors were not a new concept to poetry however the strength of extended metaphors was the explicit imagery in the quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work the poet ibn al mutazz wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the quran opoets such as badr shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the Quran.36 the quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible the study of the pauses in the quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways.37  structureedit  although the quran is known for its fluency and harmony the structure can be best described as chaotic the suras also known as verses of the quran are not placed in chronological order the only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow the topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of rhyme the quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text harmony is also present in the sound of the quran the elongations and accents present in the quran create a harmonious flow within the writing unique sound of the quran recited due to the accents create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection.36  the quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people the simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style.36 the words of the quran although unchanged are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal arabic the simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the quran a slightly easier task  culture and the quranedit  the writer al-khattabi explains how culture is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it he believes that fluency and harmony the quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text while a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the quran a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the Quran.37 because the structure of the quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen hadith were the main source of chronological order the hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context poetry after the quran began possessing this element of tradition by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the meaning.35  after the quran came down to the people the tradition of memorizing the verses became present it is believed that the larger amount of the quran memorized is a sign of a stronger faith as technology improved overtime hearing recitations of quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the versus the tradition of love poetry served as a symbolic representation of a muslims desire for a closer contact with their lord  while the influence of the quran on arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers some writers such as al- baqillani believe that poetry and the quran are in no conceivable way related due to the uniqueness of the quran poetrys imperfections prove his points that that they cannot be compared with the fluency the quran holds  arabic and islamedit  classical arabic is the language of poetry and literature news it is also mainly the language of the quran at present modern standard arabic is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the quran arabic is closely associated with the religion of islam because the quran was written in arabic but it is nevertheless also spoken by other religious groups such as arab christians mizrahi jews druze and iraqi mandaeans most of the worlds muslims do not speak classical arabic as their native language but many can read the quranic script and recite the quran among non-arab muslims translations of the quran are most often accompanied by the original text  some muslims present a monogenesis of languages and claim that the arabic language was the language revealed by god for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication based upon its system of triconsonantal roots spoken by man from which all other languages were derived having first been corrupted.3839 judaism has a similar account with the tower of babel  dialects and descendantsedit  main article varieties of arabic  different dialects of arabic  colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken dialects of arabic used throughout the arab world which differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the arabian peninsula followed by that between sedentary varieties and the much more conservative bedouin varieties all of the varieties outside of the arabian peninsula include the large majority of speakers have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in classical arabic this has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the arab conquest whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas features are present to varying degrees inside the arabian peninsula generally the arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties but have been understudied  within the non-peninsula varieties the largest difference is between the non-egyptian north african dialects moroccan arabic and the others moroccan arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to arabic speakers east of libya the converse is not true in part due to the popularity of egyptian films and other media  one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order however a much more significant factor for most dialects is as among romance languages retention change of meaning of different classical forms thus iraqi aku levantine fh and north african kayn all mean is and all come from classical arabic forms fhi kin respectively but now sound very different  examplesedit  transcription is a broad ipa transcription so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison also the pronunciation of modern standard arabic differs significantly from region to

article arabic phonology  historyedit  of the 29 proto-semitic consonants only one has been lost needed which merged with but the consonant is still found in many colloquial arabic dialects various other consonants have changed their sound too but have remained distinct an original lenited to and consistently attested in pre-islamic greek transcription of arabic languages45 became palatalized to or by the time of the quran and or in msa arabic phonologylocal variations for more detail.46 an original voiceless alveolar lateral fricative became its emphatic counterpart was considered by arabs to be the most unusual sound in arabic the classical arabics appellation lughat al-d or of the d for most modern dialects it has become an emphatic stop with loss of the laterality47 or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization classical d pronunciation of pharyngealization still occurs in the mehri language and the similar sound without velarization exists in other modern south arabian languages  other changes may also have happened classical arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different reconstructions of the sound system of proto-semitic propose different phonetic values one example is the emphatic consonants which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in Proto-Semitic.47  reduction of and between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak verbs early akkadian transcriptions of arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium bc  the classical arabic language as recorded was a poetic koine that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the arabian peninsula who spoke the most conservative variants of arabic even at the time of muhammed and before other dialects existed with many more changes including the loss of most glottal stops the loss of case endings the reduction of the diphthongs and into monophthongs o etc most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of arabic  an interesting feature of the writing system of the quran hence of classical arabic is that it contains certain features of muhammads native dialect of mecca corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard classical arabic among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing evidently final became as in the classical language but final became a different sound possibly than again in the classical language this is the apparent source of the alif maqrah alif where a final is reconstructed a letter that would normally indicate or some similar high-vowel sound but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of alif and represent the sound  literary arabicedit  the spoken varieties of arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of arabic speakers literary arabic specifically modern standard arabic is learned at school although many speakers have a native-like command of the language it is technically not the native language of any speakers both varieties can be both written and spoken although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances eg in radio broadcasts formal lectures parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial varieties even when the literary language is spoken however it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud when speaking extemporaneously making up the language on the spot as in a normal discussion among people speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties in fact there is a continuous range of spoken varieties from nearly pure modern standard arabic to a form that still uses msa grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in msa to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the edges most noticeably or non-classical aspects smoothed out to pure colloquial the particular variant register used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation often it will vary within a single encounter eg moving from nearly pure msa to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer this type of variation is characteristic of the diglossia that exists throughout the arabic-speaking world  recording of a poem by al-maarri titled no longer steal from nature  although modern standard arabic is a unitary language its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country the variation in individual of msa speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat note that it is important in descriptions of phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial dialect and the pronunciation of msa by these same speakers although they are related they are not the same for example the phoneme that derives from proto-semitic has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties eg j speakers whose native variety has either or will use the same pronunciation when speaking msa even speakers from cairo whose native egyptian arabic has normally use when speaking msa the of persian gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which isnt found in msa is used instead  another example many colloquial varieties are known for a type of vowel harmony in which the presence of an consonant triggers backed allophones of nearby vowels of the low vowels which are backed to in these circumstances and very often fronted to in all other circumstances in many spoken varieties the backed or vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant in some varieties notably egyptian arabic the allophones spread throughout the entire word usually including prefixes and suffixes even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their msa pronunciation as well but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties example speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance harmony may allow a moderate but not extreme amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their msa speech while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in msa  vowelsedit  modern standard arabic has six pure vowels with short i u and corresponding long vowels i u there are also two diphthongs and  the pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety nonetheless there are some common trends most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of and which tend towards fronted or in most situations but a back in the neighborhood of emphatic consonants some accents and dialects such as those of the hijaz have central in all situations the vowel varies towards too listen to the final vowel in the recording of al-arabiyyah at the beginning of this article for example the point is arabic has only three short vowel phonemes so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones the vowels and are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well with generally more back or centralized allophones but the differences are less great than for the low vowels the pronunciation of short and tends towards and respectively in many dialects  the definition of both and vary in ways that reflect some extent corresponding variations in the spoken dialects generally the consonants triggering allophones are the pharyngealized consonants d s and if not followed immediately by frequently the velar fricatives also trigger emphatic allophones occasionally also the pharyngeal consonants former more than the latter many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel depending on the particular nearby consonants in most msa accents emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant although in some it spreads a bit farther eg waqt waan was al-madnah or similar  in a non-emphatic environment the vowel in the diphthong tends to be fronted even more than elsewhere often pronounced or hence sayf sjf sjf but ayf however in accents with no emphatic allophones of in the hijaz the pronunciation occurs in all situations  consonantsedit  consonant phonemes of modern standard arabic  labial

arabic foreign words containing may be transcribed with or mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of arabic or the commonly diacriticized arabic letter note also that in northern egypt where

was unique to their language fact it also exists in a few other minority semitic languages eg mehri  arabic has consonants traditionally termed d s which exhibit simultaneous pharyngealization d s as well as varying degrees of velarization d s so they may be written with the or pharyngealized diacritic as d s this simultaneous articulation is described as tongue root by phonologists.51 in some transcription systems emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter for example is written d in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it for example  vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long long consonants are normally written doubled in latin transcription bb dd etc reflecting the presence of the arabic diacritic mark shaddah which indicates doubled

l     y     w   proto  semitic  ipa  arabic  standard  classical  old  syllable structureedit  arabic has two kinds of syllables open syllables and closed syllables and the syllable types with two morae of time ie cvc and cvv are termed heavy syllables while those with three morae ie cvvc and cvcc are superheavy syllables superheavy syllables in classical arabic occur in only two places at the end of the sentence to pausal pronunciation and in words such as rr mddah substance tajj disputed with each other where a long occurs before two identical consonants former short vowel between the consonants has been lost less formal pronunciations of modern standard arabic superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before clitic suffixes such as our due to the deletion of final short vowels  in surface pronunciation every vowel must be preceded by a consonant may include the glottal stop there are no cases of hiatus within a word two vowels occur next to each other without an intervening consonant some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning such as the definite article al- or words such as ishtar bought ijtim when actually pronounced one of three things happens  if the word occurs after another word ending in a consonant there is a smooth transition from final consonant to initial vowel eg al-ijtim  if the word occurs after another word ending in a vowel the initial vowel of the word is elided eg baytu of the director  if the word occurs at the beginning of an utterance a glottal stop is added onto the beginning eg al-baytu huwa house is  stressedit  word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it bears a strong relationship to vowel length the basic rules for modern standard arabic are  a final vowel long or short may not be stressed  only one of the last three syllables may be stressed  given this restriction the last heavy syllable a long vowel or ending in a consonant is stressed if it is not the final syllable  if the final syllable is super heavy and closed the form cvvc or cvcc it receives stress  if no syllable is heavy or super heavy the first possible syllable third from end is stressed  as a special exception in form vii and viii verb forms stress may not be on the first syllable despite the above rules hence inkataba subscribed or not the final short vowel is pronounced yankatibu subscribes or not the final short vowel is pronounced yankatib should subscribe likewise form viii ishtar bought yashtar buys  exampleskitbun k-ti-bun mak-ta-bun ma-k-ti-bu mak-ta-ba-tun mak-ta-ba-tun in short pronunciation ka-ta-b standard arabic wrote ka-ta-bu ka-ta-b-hu standard arabic wrote it ka-ta-b ka-ta-ba-t standard arabic fem wrote ka-tab-tu standard arabic wrote ka-tabt form or dialect doubled consonants count as two consonants ma-jal-la-tan ma-all-un  these rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced vs the normal situation where they are not pronounced as in the above example of mak-ta-ba-tun in full pronunciation but mak-ta-ba-tun in short pronunciation  the restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final  some dialects have different stress rules in the cairo arabic dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word hence mad-ra-sah q-hi-rah this also affects the way that modern standard arabic is pronounced in egypt in the arabic of sanaa stress is often retracted bay-tayn houses m-sat-hum table ma-k-tb z-rat-n mad-ra-sat-hum school this dialect only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy in a two-syllable word the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light and in longer words the final syllable cannot be stressed  levels of pronunciationedit  the final short vowels the case endings and mood endings are often not pronounced in this language despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs the following levels of pronunciation exist  full pronunciation with pausaedit  this is the most formal level actually used in speech all endings are pronounced as written except at the end of an utterance where the following changes occur  final short vowels are not pronounced possibly an exception is made for feminine plural and shortened vowels in the jussiveimperative of defective verbs eg irmi  the entire indefinite noun endings and nunation are left off the ending is left off of nouns preceded by a t marbah the in the ending that typically marks feminine nouns but pronounced as in other nouns its writing in this fashion in the arabic script  the t marbah itself of feminine nouns is pronounced as h least this is the case in extremely formal pronunciation eg some quranic recitations in practice this h is usually omitted  formal short pronunciationedit  this is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen it is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position influence from the colloquial varieties the following changes occur  most final short vowels are not pronounced however the following short vowels are pronounced  feminine plural  shortened vowels in the jussiveimperative of defective verbs eg irmi  second-person singular feminine past-tense and likewise anti sg  sometimes first-person singular past-tense  sometimes second-person masculine past-tense and likewise anta sg  final in certain short words eg laysa not sawfa marker  the nunation endings are not pronounced however they are pronounced in adverbial accusative formations eg taqrban approximately datan  the t marbah ending is unpronounced except in construct state nouns where it sounds as t in adverbial accusative constructions eg datan where the entire is pronounced  the masculine singular nisbah ending is actually pronounced and is unstressed plural and feminine singular forms ie when followed by a suffix still sound as  full endings case endings occur when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added  informal short pronunciationedit  this is the pronunciation used by speakers of modern standard arabic in extemporaneous speech ie when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text it is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply even when a clitic suffix is added basically short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations specifically  all the rules for formal short pronunciation apply except as follows  the past tense singular endings written formally as are pronounced but masculine anta is pronounced in full  unlike in formal short pronunciation the rules for dropping or modifying final endings are also applied when a clitic object or possessive suffix is added if this produces a sequence of three consonants then one of the following happens depending on the speakers native colloquial variety  a short vowel or is consistently added either between the second and third or the first and second consonants  or a short vowel is added only if an otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs typically due to a violation of the sonority hierarchy is pronounced as a three-consonant cluster but needs to be broken up  or a short vowel is never added but consonants like r l m n occurring between two other consonants will be pronounced as a syllabic consonant in the english words bottle bottom button  when a doubled consonant occurs before another consonant finally it is often shortened to a single consonant rather than a vowel added note that moroccan arabic never shortens doubled consonants or inserts short vowels to break up clusters instead tolerating arbitrary-length series of arbitrary consonants and hence moroccan arabic speakers are likely to follow the same rules in their pronunciation of modern standard arabic  the clitic suffixes themselves tend also to be changed in a way that avoids many possible occurrences of three-consonant clusters in particular generally sound as  final long vowels are often shortened merging with any short vowels that remain  depending on the level of formality the speakers education level etc various grammatical changes may occur in ways that echo the colloquial variants  any remaining case endings masculine plural nominative vs oblique will be leveled with the oblique form used everywhere in words like ab and akh with special long-vowel case endings in the construct state the nominative is used everywhere hence ab of akh of  feminine plural endings in verbs and clitic suffixes will often drop out with the masculine plural endings used instead if the speakers native variety has feminine plural endings they may be preserved but will often be modified in the direction of the forms used in the speakers native variety eg instead of  dual endings will often drop out except on nouns and then used only for emphasis to their use in the colloquial varieties elsewhere the plural endings are used feminine singular if appropriate  colloquial varietiesedit  further information varieties of arabic  vowelsedit  as mentioned above many spoken dialects have a process of emphasis spreading where the of emphatic consonants spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone in all nearby low vowels the extent of emphasis spreading varies for example in moroccan arabic it spreads as far as the first full vowel sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong on either side in many levantine dialects it spreads indefinitely but is blocked by any or while in egyptian arabic it usually spreads throughout the entire word including prefixes and suffixes in moroccan arabic u also have emphatic allophones and respectively  unstressed short vowels especially u are deleted in many contexts many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred and interchange most levantine dialects merge short u into in most contexts except directly before a single final consonant in moroccan arabic on the other hand short triggers labialization of nearby consonants velar consonants and uvular consonants and then short i u all merge into which is deleted in many contexts labialization plus is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme this essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long vowel distinction with the original long vowels i u remaining as half-long i u phonemically i u which are used to represent both short and long vowels in borrowings from literary arabic  most spoken dialects have monophthongized original aw to o all circumstances including adjacent to emphatic consonants in moroccan arabic these have subsequently merged into original u  consonantsedit  in some dialects there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example non-arabic is used in the maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names semitic became extremely early on in arabic before it was written down a few modern arabic dialects such as iraqi by persian and kurdish distinguish between and the iraqi arabic also uses sounds and uses persian adding letters eg gawjah a plum chimah a truffle and so on  early in the expansion of arabic the separate emphatic phonemes and coalesced into a single phoneme many dialects as egyptian levantine and much of the maghreb subsequently lost interdental fricatives converting into d d most dialects borrow words from the standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words but some dialects without interdental fricatives in egypt and the levant render original d in borrowed words as z z d  another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives and  retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as yemen morocco and urban areas of the maghreb it is pronounced as a glottal stop in several prestige dialects such as those spoken in cairo beirut and damascus but it is rendered as a voiced velar plosive in persian gulf upper egypt parts of the maghreb and less urban parts of the levant jordan in iraqi arabic it sometimes retains its original pronunciation and is sometimes rendered as a voiced velar plosive depending on the word some traditionally christian villages in rural areas of the levant render the sound as as do shii bahrainis in some gulf dialects it is palatalized to or it is pronounced as a voiced uvular constrictive in sudanese arabic many dialects with a modified pronunciation for maintain the pronunciation in certain words with religious or educational overtones borrowed from the classical language  is pronounced as an affricate in iraq and much of the arabian peninsula but is pronounced in most of north egypt and parts of yemen and oman in morocco tunisia and the levant and in most words in much of the persian gulf  usually retains its original pronunciation but is palatalized to in many words in israel and the palestinian territories iraq and much of the arabian peninsula often a distinction is made between the suffixes masc and fem which become and respectively in sanaa omani and bahrani is pronounced  pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds in addition the allophone automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects as a result it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given coronal consonant is phonemically emphatic or not especially in dialects with long-distance emphasis spreading notable exception is the sounds vs in moroccan arabic because the former is pronounced as an affricate but the latter is not  grammaredit  examples of how the arabic root and form system works  main article arabic grammar  literary arabicedit  main article modern standard arabic  as in other semitic languages arabic has a complex and unusual morphology method of constructing words from a basic root arabic has a nonconcatenative morphology a root consists of a set of bare consonants three which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words for example the word for wrote is constructed by combining the root k-t-b with the pattern xed to form katabtu wrote other verbs meaning xed will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants eg qaratu read akaltu ate dhahabtu went although other patterns are possible sharibtu drank qultu said takallamtu spoke where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix is always used  from a single root k-t-b numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns  katabtu wrote  kattabtu had written  ktabtu corresponded someone  aktabtu dictated  iktatabtu subscribed  taktabn corresponded with each other  aktubu write  ukattibu have written  uktibu correspond someone  uktibu dictate  aktatibu subscribe  nataktabu correspond each other  kotiba was written  uktiba was dictated  maktoub  muktab  kitb  kotub  ktib  kuttb  maktab office  maktabah bookshop  etc  nouns and adjectivesedit  nouns in literary arabic have three grammatical cases accusative and genitive used when the noun is governed by a preposition three numbers dual and plural two genders and feminine and three definite and construct the cases of singular nouns than those that end in long are indicated by suffixed short vowels for nominative for accusative for genitive  the feminine singular is often marked by which is reduced to or before a pause plural is indicated either through endings sound plural or internal modification broken plural definite nouns include all proper nouns all nouns in state and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article indefinite singular nouns than those that end in long add a final to the case-marking vowels giving or is also referred to as nunation or tanwn  adjectives in literary arabic are marked for case number gender and state as for nouns however the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective which takes the or suffix  pronouns in literary arabic are marked for person number and gender there are two varieties independent pronouns and enclitics enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns the first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs and for nouns or prepositions after consonants after vowels  nouns verbs pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects however non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular furthermore a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun numerals between three and ten show agreement in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa  verbsedit  verbs in literary arabic are marked for person second or third gender and number they are conjugated in two major paradigms and non-past two voices and passive and six moods imperative subjunctive jussive shorter energetic and longer energetic the fifth and sixth moods the energetics exist only in classical arabic but not in MSA.54 there are also two participles and passive and a verbal noun but no infinitive  the past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed perfective and imperfective indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect the moods other than the indicative occur only in the non-past and the future tense is signaled by prefixing sa- or sawfa onto the non-past the past and non-past differ in the form of the stem past katab- vs non-past and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person number and gender in the past the person number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme while in the non-past a combination of prefixes encoding person and suffixes encoding gender and number are used the passive voice uses the same personnumbergender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem  the following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb kataba write note that in modern standard the energetic mood either long or short form which have the same meaning is almost never used  derivationedit  like other semitic languages and unlike most other languages arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology a large number of templates applied roots to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words  for verbs a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems which there are about fifteen each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems active and passive participles and verbal noun these are referred to by western scholars as i ii and so on through xv forms xi to xv are rare these stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative intensive and reflexive stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs albeit often semantically related and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm as a result these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology not part of the inflectional system  examples of the different verbs formed from the root k-t-b for form ix which is limited to colors and physical defects  most of these forms are exclusively classical arabic  form  past  meaning  non-past  meaning  i  kataba  wrote  yaktubu  writes  ii  kattaba  made write  yukattibu  makes write  iii  ktaba  corresponded

write  form ii is sometimes used to create transitive denominative verbs built from nouns form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives  the associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in arabic this is similar to the process by which for example the english gerund to a verbal noun has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social often work-related event where people gather together to have a lexicalized verbal noun another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots such as the of location in ma- maktab office k-t-b mabakh  the only three genuine suffixes are as follows  the feminine suffix variously derives terms for women from related terms for men or more generally terms along the same lines as the corresponding masculine eg maktabah a writing-related place but different from maktab as above  the nisbah suffix this suffix is extremely productive and forms adjectives meaning to x it corresponds to english adjectives in etc  the feminine nisbah suffix this is formed by adding the feminine suffix onto nisba adjectives to form abstract nouns for example from the basic root sh-r-k can be derived the form viii verb ishtaraka cooperate participate and in turn its verbal noun ishtirk participation can be formed this in turn can be made into a nisbah adjective ishtirk from which an abstract noun ishtirkiyyah can be derived other recent formations are jumhriyyah jumhr general public and the gaddafi-specific variation jamhriyyah republic jamhr masses pl of jumhr as above  colloquial varietiesedit  main article varieties of arabic  the spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances they have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes often for indicative vs unmarked subjunctive they have also mostly lost the indefinite and the internal passive  the following is an example of a regular verb

arabic alphabet and arabic braille  islamic calligraphy written by a malay muslim in malaysia the calligrapher is making a rough draft  the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic through nabatean to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic scripts to greek script traditionally there were several differences between the western african and middle eastern versions of the alphabetin particular the fa had a dot underneath and qaf a single dot above in the maghreb and the order of the letters was slightly different least when they were used as numerals  however the old maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools of west africa arabic like all other semitic languages for the latin-written maltese and the languages with the geez script is written from right to left there are several styles of script notably naskh which is used in print and by computers and ruqah which is commonly used in handwriting.55  calligraphyedit  main article islamic calligraphy  after khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi finally fixed the arabic script around 786, many styles were developed both for the writing down of the quran and other books and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration  arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the western world and is still considered by arabs as a major art form calligraphers are held in great esteem being cursive by nature unlike the latin script arabic script is used to write down a verse of the quran a hadith or simply a proverb the composition is often abstract but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal one of the current masters of the genre is hassan massoudy  in modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language necessary for digitized unification will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy.56  romanizationedit  main article romanization of arabic  examples of different transliterationtranscription schemes  letter  ipa  ungegn

romanization of arabic ie methods of accurately and efficiently representing arabic with the latin script there are various conflicting motivations involved which leads to multiple systems some are interested in transliteration ie representing the spelling of arabic while others focus on transcription ie representing the pronunciation of arabic differ in that for example the same letter is used to represent both a consonant as in or and a vowel as in or some systems eg for scholarly use are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of arabic generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the arabic script these systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as for the sound equivalently written sh in english other systems the bah orthography are intended to help readers who are neither arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of arabic names and phrases.57 these less tend to avoid diacritics and use digraphs sh and kh these are usually simpler to read but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems and may lead to ambiguities eg whether to interpret sh as a single sound as in gash or a combination of two sounds as in gashouse the ala-lc romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a prime symbol eg ashal  during the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometimes known as im arabic  to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other characters were appropriated for example the numeral may be used to represent the arabic letter there is no universal name for this type of transliteration but some have named it arabic chat alphabet other systems of transliteration exist such as using dots or capitalization to represent the counterparts of certain consonants for instance using capitalization the letter may be represented by d its emphatic counterpart may be written as d  numeralsedit  in most of present-day north africa the western arabic numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are used however in egypt and arabic-speaking countries to the east of it the eastern arabic numerals are in use when representing a number in arabic the lowest-valued position is placed on the right so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right but numbers are spoken in the traditional arabic fashion with units and tens reversed from the modern english usage for example 24 is said and twenty just like in the german language and classical hebrew and 1975 is said thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy or more eloquently thousand and nine-hundred five seventy  language-standards regulatorsedit  academy of the arabic language is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in the arab league the most active are in damascus and cairo they review language development monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries they also publish old and historical arabic manuscripts  see also arabic language international council  as a foreign languageedit  arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools especially muslim schools universities around the world have classes that teach arabic as part of their foreign languages middle eastern studies and religious studies courses arabic language schools exist to assist students to learn arabic outside the academic world there are many arabic language schools in the arab world and other muslim countries because the quran is written in arabic and all islamic terms are in arabic millionscitation needed of muslims arab and non-arab study the language software and books with tapes are also important part of arabic learning as many of arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or arabic language school classes available radio series of arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stationscitation needed a number of websites on the internet provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education most teach modern standard arabic but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries.58  arabic speakers and other languagesedit  this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it 2013  in bahrain arabic is largely used in educational settings  historically arab linguists considered the arabic language to be superior to all other languages and took almost no interest in learning any language other than arabiccitation needed with the sole example of medieval linguist abu hayyan al-gharnati who while a scholar of the arabic language was not ethnically arab scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics considering all other languages inferior.59  in modern times the educated upper classes in the arab world have taken a nearly opposite view yasir suleiman wrote in 2011 that and knowing english or french in most of the middle east and north africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and feigning or asserting weakness or lack of facility in arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status class and perversely even education through a mlange of code-switching practises.60 arab-american professor franck salamah went as far as to declare arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas blaming its stagnation for arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of the ideas they express with it.61  see alsoedit  arabic diglossia  aida international association of arabic dialectology  arabic grammar  arabic influence on the spanish language  arabic literature  arabicenglish
