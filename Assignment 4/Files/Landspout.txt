landspout  a landspout near north platte nebraska on may 22, 2004. note the characteristic smooth tubular shape similar to that of a waterspout  a landspout is a term coined by meteorologist howard b bluestein in 1985 for a kind of tornado not associated with a mesocyclone.1 the glossary of meteorology defines a landspout as  expression describing tornadoes occurring with a parent cloud in its growth stage and with its vorticity originating in the boundary layer  the parent cloud does not contain a preexisting mid-level mesocyclone the landspout was so named because it looks like weak florida keys waterspout over land.2  landspouts form during the growth stage of a cumulus congestus cloud by stretching boundary layer vorticity upward and into the cumulus congestuss updraft they generally are smaller and weaker than supercell tornadoes and do not form from a mesocyclone or pre-existing rotation in the cloud because of this landspouts are rarely detected by doppler weather radar.3  landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of waterspouts usually taking the form of a translucent and highly laminar helical tube landspouts are considered tornadoes since a rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud not all landspouts are visible and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust  a few landspouts can persist in excess of 15 minutes and have produced F3 damage4 however they rarely produce damage greater than EF-2.citation needed  see alsoedit  dust devil  tornado  waterspout  vortex engine  referencesedit  bluestein howard b formation of a in a squall line in oklahoma preprints 14th conf on severe local storms indianapolis american meteorological society pp.267270. retrieved 27 march 2007.  american meteorological society of meteorology second edition ametsocorg retrieved 27 march 2007.  wakimoto wilson tornadoes monthly weather review 117 11131140.
