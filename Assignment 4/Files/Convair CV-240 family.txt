canadair CC-109 Cosmopolitan1  the convair CV-240 is an american airliner produced by convair from 1947 to 1954, initially as a possible replacement of the ubiquitous douglas DC-3. featuring a more modern design with cabin pressurization the 240 series was able to make some inroads as a commercial airliner and also had a long development cycle which resulted in various civil and military variants although reduced in numbers through attrition the in various forms continue to fly into the 21st century.1  contents  1 design and development  2 operational history  3 variants  3.1 civil

developmentedit  the design began its life in a requirement by american airlines for an airliner to replace its douglas DC-3s. convairs original design the unpressurised model 110, was a twin-engine low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction with 30 seats it was powered by pratt whitney R-2800 double wasp radial engines and had a tricycle landing gear and a ventral airstair for passenger boarding.2 the prototype model 110, registration NX90653, first flew on july 8, 1946.2 by this time american had changed its requirements to require pressurization and deemed the design too small the first prototype was used by convair for development work for the 240 series before being broken up in 1947.3  a 1949-built convair 240 of swiss air lines at manchester england in march 1950  to meet the requirements of airlines for a pressurized airliner convair produced a revised designthe model 240. this had a longer but thinner fuselage than the model 110, accommodating 40 passengers in the first pressurized twin-engined airliner.4 the 240 first flew on march 16, 1947.5  the model 240 was followed by the model 340 that had a longer fuselage longer-span wings and more powerful engines the 340 first flew on october 5, 1951.6 in 1954, in an attempt to compete with turboprop-powered airliners like the vickers viscount convair produced the model 440 metropolitan with more streamlined cowlings new engine exhausts and better soundproofing for the cabin.7 as the 240 evolved into the CV-340 and CV-440, the limit of piston-engine performance was reached and future development centered on conversion to turboprop power.1  operational historyedit  the first delivery of a production convairliner was to american on february 29, 1948.5 a total of 75 were delivered to american with another 50 going to western airlines continental airlines pan american airways klm swissair sabena and trans australia Airlines.8  two convair 580s of the aspen colorado-based aspen airways at

daughter during his campaign this aircraft is now preserved in the national air and space museum  after aborted negotiations with twa and eastern for 240 orders the production of the 240 series was temporarily halted in response to a united inquiry convair redesigned the super 240, calling it the CV-340. united ordered 55, and more us orders came from braniff continental delta northeast and national other orders came from abroad and the CV-340 proved popular in south america the CV-340 earned an enviable reputation for reliability and profitability and was developed into the CV-440
