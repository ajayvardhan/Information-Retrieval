on the rivers right descending bank the majority of the lower potomac river is part of the state of maryland exceptions include a small tidal portion within the district of columbia and the border with virginia being delineated from to point various bays and shoreline indentations lie in virginia except for a small portion of its headwaters in west virginia the north branch potomac river is considered part of maryland to the low water mark on the opposite bank the south branch potomac river lies completely within the state of west virginia except for its headwaters which lie in virginia  the potomac river in washington dc with rosslyn arlington virginia in the background  the potomac river runs 405 miles from the fairfax stone in west virginia on the allegheny plateau to point lookout maryland and drains 14,679 square miles the length of the river from the junction of its north and south branches to point lookout is 302 miles the average flow is 10,800 fts ms the largest flow ever recorded on the potomac at washington dc was in march 1936 when it reached 425,000fts ms the lowest flow ever recorded at the same location was 600fts ms in september 1966.2  the river has two sources the source of the north branch is at the fairfax stone located at the junction of grant tucker and preston counties in west virginia the source of the south branch is located near hightown in northern highland county virginia the rivers two branches converge just east of green spring in hampshire county west virginia to form the potomac  once the potomac drops from the piedmont to the coastal plain at little falls tides further influence the river as it passes through washington dc and beyond salinity in the potomac river estuary increases thereafter with distance downstream the estuary also widens reaching 11 statute miles wide at its mouth between point lookout maryland and smith point virginia before flowing into the chesapeake bay  historyedit  view of the potomac from mount vernon  is a european spelling of patowmeck the algonquian name of a native american village perhaps meaning brought.3 native americans had different names for different parts of the river calling the river above great falls cohongarooton meaning geese45 and below the fall meaning of swans.6 the spelling of the name has taken many forms over the years from on captain john smiths map to and numerous other spellings in the 18th century and now the rivers name was officially decided upon as potomac by the board on geographic names in 1931.7  the river itself is at least two million years old likely extending back ten to twenty million years before present when the atlantic ocean lowered and exposed coastal sediments along the fall line this included the area at great falls which eroded into its present form during recent glaciation periods.8  the potomac river flowing through water gaps in the blue ridge mountains near harpers ferry west virginia virginia is on the left maryland on the right west virginia in the upper right  the potomac river brings together a variety of cultures throughout the watershed from the coal miners of upstream west virginia to the urban residents of the nations capital and along the lower potomac the watermen of virginias northern neck  being situated in an area rich in american history and american heritage has led to the potomac being nicknamed nations river george washington the first president of the united states was born in surveyed and spent most of his life within the potomac basin all of washington dc the nations capital city also lies within the watershed the 1859 siege of harpers ferry at the rivers confluence with the shenandoah was a precursor to numerous epic battles of the american civil war in and around the potomac and its tributaries such as the 1861 battle of balls bluff and the 1862 battle of shepherdstown general robert e lee crossed the river thereby invading the north and threatening washington dc twice in campaigns climaxing in the battles of antietam 17, 1862 and gettysburg 13, 1863. confederate general jubal early crossed the river in july 1864 on his attempted raid on the nations capital the river not only divided the union from the confederacy but also gave name to the unions largest army the army of the Potomac.9  harpers ferry west virginia at the confluence of the potomac and shenandoah rivers  the patowmack canal was intended by george washington to connect the tidewater region near georgetown with cumberland maryland started in 1785 on the virginia side of the river it was not completed until 1802. financial troubles led to the closure of the canal in 1830. the chesapeake and ohio canal operated along the banks of the potomac in maryland from 1831 to 1924 and also connected cumberland to washington D.C.10 this allowed freight to be transported around the rapids known as the great falls of the potomac river as well as many other smaller rapids  washington dc began using the potomac as its principal source of drinking water with the opening of the washington aqueduct in 1864, using a water intake constructed at great Falls.11  in march 1996 an agreement was signed which made the potomac a river of the ara river one of the principal rivers of Tokyo.12 president bill clinton designated the potomac as one of the american heritage rivers in 1998.13  water supply and water qualityedit  an average of approximately 486million us gallons of water per day is withdrawn daily in the washington area for water supply.2  anacostia river during the 1936 potomac river flood  eutrophication in the potomac river is evident from this bright green water in washington dc caused by a dense bloom of cyanobacteria april 2012  as a result of damaging floods in 1936 and 1937, the army corps of engineers proposed a series of dams that were intended to regulate the river and to provide a more reliable water supply one dam was to be built at little falls just north of washington backing its pool up to great falls just above great falls a much larger dam was proposed whose reservoir would extend to harpers Ferry.14 several other dams were proposed for the potomac and its tributaries when detailed studies were issued by the corps in the 1950s, they met sustained opposition led by us supreme court justice william o douglas resulting in the plans abandonment.15 the only dam project that did get built was jennings randolph lake on the north branch the corps built a supplementary water intake for the washington aqueduct at little falls in 1959.16  in 1940 congress passed a law authorizing creation of an interstate compact to coordinate water quality management among states in the potomac basin maryland west virginia pennsylvania virginia and the district of columbia agreed to establish the interstate commission on the potomac river basin the compact was amended in 1970 to include coordination of water supply issues and land use issues related to water quality.17  beginning in the 19th century with increasing mining and agriculture upstream and urban sewage and runoff downstream the water quality of the potomac river deteriorated this created conditions of severe eutrophication it is said that president abraham lincoln used to escape to the highlands on summer nights to escape the rivers stench in the 1960s, with dense green algal blooms covering the rivers surface president lyndon johnson declared the river national disgrace and set in motion a long-term effort to reduce pollution from sewage and restore the beauty and ecology of this historic river one of significant pollution control projects at the time was the expansion of the blue plains advanced wastewater treatment plant which serves washington and several surrounding communities.18 enactment of the 1972 clean water act led to construction or expansion of additional sewage treatment plants in the potomac watershed controls on phosphorus one of the principal contributors to eutrophication were implemented in the 1980s, through sewage plant upgrades and restrictions on phosphorus in detergents.17  by the end of the 20th century there was notable success as massive algal blooms vanished and recreational fishing and boating rebounded still the aquatic habitat of the potomac river and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication heavy metals pesticides and other toxic chemicals over-fishing alien species and pathogens associated with fecal coliform bacteria and shellfish diseases in 2005 two federal agencies the us geological survey and the fish and wildlife service began to identify fish in the potomac and tributaries that exhibited characteristics as a result of endocrine disruption caused by some form of pollution.19 on november 13, 2007, the potomac conservancy an environmental group issued the river a grade of citing high levels of pollution and the reports of fish.20 since then the river has improved with a reduction in nutrient runoff return of fish populations and land protection along the river as a result the same group issued a grade of in 2016.  legal issuesedit  the tidewater potomac near arlington county virginia  map of land use in the watershed  for 400 years maryland and virginia have disputed control of the potomac and its north branch since both states original colonial charters grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers in its first state constitution adopted in 1776, virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it an act disputed by maryland both states acceded to the compact of 1785 and the 1877 black-jenkins award which grants maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low water mark on the virginia side while permitting virginia full riparian rights short of obstructing navigation  from 1957 to 1996, the maryland department of the environment routinely issued permits applied for by virginia entities concerning use of the potomac however in 1996 the mde denied a permit submitted by the fairfax county water authority to build a water intake 725 feet m offshore citing potential harm to marylands interests by an increase in virginia sprawl caused by the project after years of failed appeals within the maryland governments appeal processes in 2000 virginia took the case to the supreme court of the united states which exercises original jurisdiction in cases between two states maryland claimed virginia lost its riparian rights by acquiescing to mdes permit process for 63 years began its permit process in 1933. a special master appointed by the supreme court to investigate recommended the case be settled in favor of virginia citing the language in the 1785 compact and the 1877 award on december 9, 2003, the court agreed in a 7-2 decision.22  the original charters are silent as to which branch from the upper potomac serves as the boundary but this was settled by the 1785 compact when west virginia seceded from virginia in 1863, the question of west virginias succession in title to the lands between the branches of the river was raised as well as title to the river itself claims by maryland to west virginia land north of the south branch of mineral and grant counties and parts of hampshire hardy tucker and pendleton counties and by west virginia to the potomacs high-water mark were rejected by the supreme court in two separate decisions in 1910.2324  north branch potomac riveredit  the north branch between cumberland maryland and ridgeley west
