the soyuz TMA-4 spacecraft with european space agency astronaut andr kuipers after more than a week of joint operations and handover activities padalka and fincke officially took command of the station on 29 april when expedition 8 commander michael foale and flight engineer alexander kaleri left the station this mission was the site for the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity project  expedition 8 and kuipers returned to earth that same day aboard the soyuz TMA-3 spacecraft kuipers 11-day mission to the iss was part of a commercial agreement between esa and the federal space agency of russia  spacewalksedit  the expedition 9 crew conducted four spacewalks during its stay at the international space station the four spacewalks were devoted to iss maintenance and assembly all four were based out of the pirs docking compartment and used russian orlan spacesuits  before these four extravehicular activities 52 spacewalks had been performed at the iss with 27

zarya control module flow control panel and installed four safety tether fairleads on zaryas handrails  atv support operations included installing equipment for the air-to-air radio link antennas and removing all covers from antennas  other tasks included installing a pressure control and exposure monitor sensor on pirs and installing protective components on the brackets of pirs ring handrails on eva hatch no 2.  mission patchedit  the design of the expedition 9 mission patch includes a tribute to astronauts and cosmonauts who gave their lives in space exploration the outspread wings of the
