islands yucatn peninsula northern mexico southern texas  part of the 1980 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane allen was a rare and extremely powerful cape verde-type hurricane that struck the caribbean eastern and northern mexico and southern texas in august 1980. the first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 atlantic hurricane season it was one of the strongest hurricanes in recorded history it was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category5 status on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale on three separate occasions and spent more time as a Category5 than all but two other atlantic hurricanes allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190mph 1 thus making it the strongest atlantic hurricane by wind speed until hurricane patricia in 2015, these were also the highest sustained winds in the western hemisphere  throughout its life allen moved through the deep tropics on a westerly to north-westerly course through the tropical atlantic ocean caribbean sea and gulf of mexico before making its final landfall near the united statesmexico border at peak strength it passed near haiti causing hundreds of deaths and heavy damage after crossing the gulf of mexico allen weakened as it struck the lower texas coast causing high winds a significant storm surge and heavy rainfall which caused damage to southern texas overall allen killed at least 269 people and left just over in damages us dollars or billion in 2016 dollars mostly within the united states and haiti because of its impact the name allen was retired from the six-year revolving list of atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1981 and the name was replaced by andrew the name andrew was subsequently retired after the 1992 seasons

meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  allen was an early cape verde-type hurricane which originated from a tropical wave that previously moved off the african coastline on july 30. the system developed as it moved westward becoming a tropical depression on august 1.1 however the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on allen until almost 24 hours later when it was centered 1,300mi east of the windward Islands.2 early on august 2, as the depression moved towards the caribbean it had intensified and became the first named storm of the season.1 the national hurricane center noted that conditions appeared favorable for further intensification however it was also noted that a large cold-low north of puerto rico was producing strong westerly wind shear which would cause allen to possibly encounter unfavorable conditions within 72 hours.3 although slower forward movement was anticipated,4 allen remained at generally the same westward pace between 17 and 23mph and 37kmh.1 by august 3, the national hurricane center retracted predictions of less favorable conditions from the cold-low north of puerto rico since that weather system was weakening and moving westward.5  most intense atlantic hurricanes  rank  hurricane  season  pressure  hpa  inhg  1  wilma  2005  882  26.05  2

post-analysis it was discovered that allen had been a hurricane since 0000 utc on august 3. shortly after the upgrade allen began a period of rapid deepening and intensified into a major hurricane at 0000 utc august 4, while roughly 38mi northwest of bridgetown barbados six hours later allen passed only 8mi south of st lucia at 0600 UTC.1 although the national hurricane center noted that conditions favored slow strengthening,8 allen continued to rapidly intensify and became a category 4 hurricane only two hours after that advisory.1 later on august 4, the national hurricane center noted a barometric pressure of 946mbar 27.9inHg, and that it would not drop significantly within 24 hours.9 shortly before 0000 utc on august 5, the minimum pressure decreased to 924mbar 27.3inHg, which was noted as equivalent to hurricane david in the previous season.10  by august 5, allen intensified into a Category5 hurricane while south of puerto rico this made allen the earliest category 5 hurricane in the atlantic on record,1 but was later surpassed by hurricane emily which reached that intensity on july 16, 2005. during this time allen attained a central pressure of 911mbar 26.9inHg, the lowest pressure on record in the eastern caribbean sea hence the barometric pressure dropped by 35mbar 1.0inHg less than 10 hours after the national hurricane center stated that the pressure would not decrease significantly within the time of 24 hours  the eye passed between hispaniola and jamaica as a Category4 hurricane after friction with the mountains of haiti and jamaica had caused it to weaken allen intensified back to a Category5 hurricane retaining this intensity for over a day it then moved past the islands of cayman brac and little cayman causing moderate damage on cayman brac with winds near 135mph. the storm then moved between cuba and the yucatn peninsula reaching its peak intensity of 190mph and a minimum pressure of 899mbar 26.5inHg while crossing the yucatn channel during allens trek through the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico its center of circulation never crossed over land despite its close passage to various islands in and around the caribbean sea.6  allen again weakened to a Category4 storm due to friction with mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a third time as it moved over the open waters of the gulf of mexico keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to 909mbar 26.8inHg, the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western gulf of mexico shortly before landfall a dry air mass in the western gulf of mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially allen made landfall north of brownsville texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph it

the wave action from the storm.20 offshore jamaica greater numbers of smaller-sized damselfishes was witnessed in the wake of Allen.21 eight deaths in jamaica were attributed to allen damage was very significant along the northeast coast where the hurricane made its closest approach to the island and created a 12 metres storm surge three deaths were attributed to allen in Cuba.16  extensive damage

passage of allen with the highest totals exceeding 7 inches the hurricane earlier brushed the yucatn peninsula as allen only affected sparsely populated regions of mexico there were no reports of significant damage.16  united statesedit  storm surge smashed building in corpus christi  in texas the storm surge was reported as high as 12 feet at port mansfield though it may have been higher elsewhere along the texas coast a peak wind gust of 129mph was also measured at port mansfield tropical storm-force winds in corpus christi texas blew roof gravel through the city which led to substantial glass breakage to the 18-story guarantee bank building and a 12-story wing of spohn hospital.25 the storm caused seven deaths in texas and 17 in louisiana resulting from the crash of a helicopter evacuating workers from an offshore platform allen spawned several tornadoes in texas one tornado caused in damage when it hit austin texas making it the costliest tropical cyclone-spawned tornado in recorded history overall however the storm caused limited damage in the united states due to its suddenly diminished power and because its highest tides and winds hit a sparsely-populated portion of the texas coast.1626  allen dumped 10 inches to 20 inches of rain in south texas ending a summer-long drought during the heat wave of 1980.27  retirement and recordsedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  because of the destruction and extreme death tolls the name allen was retired from the atlantic tropic storms list by the world meteorological organization in the spring of 1981, and will not be used for a future atlantic hurricane.28 it was replaced with andrew would itself be retired after the 1992 season in the 1986 season.29  debris from hurricane allen  when allen reached Category5 intensity on august 5, it became the earliest Category5 storm ever recorded this record stood until hurricane emily surpassed it on july 16, 2005. allen is one of three atlantic hurricanes to reach Category5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on three separate occasions the others being hurricane ivan and hurricane isabel allen also produced the fifth-lowest minimum pressure ever recorded in the atlantic basin at 899 mbar and was the strongest known hurricane in the basin in terms of pressure since 1935. until then it was the second strongest hurricane by pressure in the atlantic basin but was since pushed down to fifth and no hurricane has achieved 190 miles per hour winds in this basin since then.30 it remains the most intense storm ever in august allen spent nearly 3days as a Category5 storm initially the longest stretch of any previous atlantic hurricane on record however a reanalysis of the 1932 cuba hurricane showed that it spent 3 hours longer at Category5 intensity than Allen,6 and hurricane irma in 2017 also spent slightly more time as a Category5 hurricane than allen five typhoons have spent longer as category 5 storms including most recently karen and nancy in the early 1960s.31  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  list of tropical cyclones  list of atlantic hurricanes  list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes  notesedit
