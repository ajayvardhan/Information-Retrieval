space center is one of ten national aeronautics and space administration field centers since december 1968, kennedy space center has been nasas primary launch center of human spaceflight launch operations for the apollo skylab and space shuttle programs were carried out from kennedy space center launch complex 39 and managed by KSC.2 located on the east coast of florida ksc is adjacent to cape canaveral air force station the management of the two entities work very closely together share resources and even own facilities on each others property  though the first apollo flights and all project mercury and project gemini flights took off from ccafs the launches were managed by ksc and its previous organization the launch operations Directorate.34 starting with the fourth gemini mission the nasa launch control center in florida control center later the launch control center began handing off control of the vehicle to the mission control center shortly after liftoff in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.56  additionally the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions researches food production and in-situ resource utilization for off earth exploration,7 and more since 2010, the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships,8 even adding a new launch pad in 2015.  there are about 700 facilities grouped across the centers 144,000 acres.9 among the unique facilities at ksc are the 525ft tall vehicle assembly building for stacking nasas largest rockets the operations and checkout

transferred 5,000 personnel and the missile firing laboratory to nasa to become the launch operations directorate under nasas marshall space flight center  president john f kennedys 1961 goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 required an expansion of launch operations on july 1, 1962, the launch operations directorate was separated from msfc to become the launch operations center also cape canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth 363-foot tall 7,500,000-pound-force thrust saturn v rocket which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads therefore the decision was made to build a new loc site located adjacent to cape canaveral on merritt island  nasa began land acquisition in 1962, buying title to 131 square miles and negotiating with the state of florida for an additional 87 square miles the major buildings in kscs industrial area were designed by architect charles Luckman.11 construction began in november 1962, and kennedy visited the site twice in 1962, and again just a week before his assassination on november 22, 1963.12  on november 29, 1963, the facility was given its current name by president lyndon b johnson under executive order 11129.1314 johnsons order joined both the civilian loc and the military cape canaveral station facilities of station no 1 of the atlantic missile range under the designation f kennedy space center spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind nasa administrator james e webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the kennedy space center name applied only to the loc while the air force issued a general order renaming the military launch site cape kennedy air force Station.15  locationedit  located on merritt island florida the center is north-northwest of cape canaveral on the atlantic ocean midway between miami and jacksonville on floridas space coast due east of orlando it is 34 miles long and roughly six miles wide covering 219 square miles  ksc is a major central florida tourist destination and is approximately one hours drive from the orlando area the kennedy space center visitor complex offers public tours of the center and cape canaveral air force station  because much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed the site also serves as an important wildlife sanctuary mosquito lagoon indian river merritt island national wildlife refuge and canaveral national seashore are other features of the area

apollo programedit  main articles apollo program and list of apollo missions  a saturn v carrying apollo 15 rolls out to pad 39A in 1971 on mobile launch platform 1.  from 1967 through 1973, there were 13 saturn v launches including the ten remaining apollo missions after apollo 7. the first of two unmanned flights apollo 4 501 on november 9, 1967, was also the first rocket launch from ksc the saturn vs first manned launch on december 21, 1968 was apollo 8s lunar orbiting mission the next two missions tested the lunar module apollo 9 orbit and apollo 10 orbit apollo 11, launched from pad a on july 16, 1969, made the first moon landing on july 20. apollo 12 followed four months later from 19701972, the apollo program concluded at ksc with the launches of missions 13 through 17.  skylabedit  on may 14, 1973, the last saturn v launch put the skylab space station in orbit from pad 39A. by this time the cape kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the saturn ib were decommissioned and pad b was modified to launch three manned missions to skylab that year as well as the final apollo spacecraft for the apollosoyuz test project in 1975.  space shuttleedit  main articles space shuttle program and list of space shuttle missions  shuttle discovery launching from pad 39A on STS-60, february 3, 1994  as the space shuttle was being designed nasa received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than ksc which demanded study ksc had important advantages including its existing facilities location on the intracoastal waterway and its southern latitude which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits disadvantages included its inability to safely launch military missions into polar orbit since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the carolinas or cuba corrosion from the salt air and frequent cloudy or stormy weather although building a new site at white sands missile range in new mexico was seriously considered nasa announced its decision in april 1972 to use ksc for the shuttle.16 since the shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control the launch of columbia on april 12, 1981 for its first orbital mission STS-1, was nasas first manned launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior unmanned launches  shuttle atlantis is moved to pad 39A for the 1990 launch of STS-36.  in 1976, the vabs south parking area was the site of third century america a science and technology display commemorating the us bicentennial concurrent with this event the us flag was painted on the south side of the vab during the late 1970s, LC-39 was reconfigured to support the space shuttle two orbiter processing facilities were built near the vab as hangars with a third added in the 1980s.  kscs 2.9-mile shuttle landing facility was the orbiters primary end-of-mission landing site although the first ksc landing did not take place until the tenth flight when challenger completed STS-41-B on february 11, 1984 the primary landing site until then was edwards air force base in california subsequently used as a backup landing site the slf also provided a return-to-launch-site abort option which was not utilized the slf is among the longest runways in the world.17  after 24 successful shuttle flights challenger was torn apart 73 seconds after the launch of STS-51-L on january 28, 1986 the first shuttle launch from pad 39B and the first us manned launch failure killing the seven crew members an o-ring seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff leading to subsequent structural failures flights resumed on september 29, 1988 with STS-26 after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program  on february 1, 2003, columbia and her crew of seven were lost during re-entry over texas during the STS-107 mission 113th shuttle flight a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from pad 39A on january 16, when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiters external fuel tank struck the orbiters left wing during reentry the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure like the challenger disaster the resulting investigation and modifications interrupted shuttle flight operations at ksc for more than two years until the STS-114 launch on july 26, 2005.  the shuttle program experienced five main engine shutdowns at LC-39, all within four seconds before launch and one abort to orbit STS-51-F on july 29, 1985. shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes conducting space science and technology experiments visits to the russian mir space station construction and servicing of the international space station deployment and servicing of the hubble space telescope and serving as a space laboratory the shuttle was retired from service in july 2011 after 135 launches  constellationedit  on october 28, 2009, the ares i-x launch from pad 39B was the first unmanned launch from ksc since the skylab workshop in 1973.  expendable launch vehicles  beginning in 1958, nasa and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches referred to as unmanned,18 cooperating as they broke ground in the field in the early 1960s, nasa had as many as two robotic mission launches a month the frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles as engineers gathered data learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades in 1963, with the intent of ksc elv work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities a separate atlascentaur organization was formed under nasas lewis center glenn research center taking that responsibility from the launch operations center KSC.6  though almost all robotics missions launched from the cape canaveral air force station ksc the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the Cape.6 in 1965, kscs unmanned launch operations directorate became responsible all nasa unmanned launch operations including those at vandenberg air force base from the 1950s to 1978, ksc chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the us overseeing their near launch processing and checkout in addition to government missions ksc performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also though non-us government entities provided reimbursement nasa also funded ccafs launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements  all this changed with the commercial space launch act of 1984, after which nasa only coordinated its own and national oceanic and atmospheric administration elv launches companies were able to their own launch vehicles6 and utilize nasas launch facilities payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of ksc reagans 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from ksc to commercial companies.19 that same year launch complexes on ccafs started transferring from nasa to air force management.6  in the 1990s, though ksc was not performing the hands-on elv work engineers still maintained understanding of elvs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight ksc also worked on elv research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize ksc personnel as a resource for technical issues ksc with the payload and launch vehicle industries developed advances in automation of the elv launch and ground operations for the purpose of enabling competitiveness of us rockets against the global market.6  in 1998, the launch services program formed at ksc pulling together programs personnel that already existed at ksc grc goddard space flight center and more to manage the launch of nasa and noaa robotic missions ccafs and vafb are the primary launch sites for lsp missions though other sites are occasionally used lsp payloads such as the mars science laboratory have been processed at ksc before being transferred to a launch pad on ccafs  space station processingedit  as the international space station modules design began in the early 1990s, ksc began to work with other nasa centers and international partners to prepare for processing prior to launch on board the space shuttles ksc utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 spacelab missions in the operations and checkout building to gather expectations of iss processing these experiences were incorporated into the design of the space station processing facility which began construction in 1993. the space station directorate formed in 1996. ksc personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.6  from 1997 to 2007, ksc planned and performed on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules three multi-element integration testing sessions and the integration systems test numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit  today ksc continues to process iss payloads from across the world prior to launch along with developing its own experiments for on orbit.20  current programs and initiativesedit  the following are current programs and initiatives at kennedy space Center21  commercial crew Program22  ground systems development and operations Program23  nasa is currently designing the next heavy launch vehicle known as the space launch system for continuation of human spaceflight  on december 5, 2014, nasa launched the first unmanned

the center operated its own 17-mile short-line railroad.35 this operation was discontinued in 2015, with the sale of its final two locomotives a third had already been donated to a museum the line was costing million annually to maintain.36  payload processingedit  payloads are received processed and integrated together in the operations and checkout building dating back to the 1960s with the gemini and apollo programs 70s with the skylab program and 80s and 90s for initial segments of the international space Station.37  the three-story 457,000 square feet space station processing facility consists of two processing bays an airlock operational control rooms laboratories logistics areas and office space for support of non-hazardous station and shuttle payloads to iso 14644-1 class 5 standards.38  the vertical processing facility features a 71 feet x 38 feet door where payloads which are processed in the vertical position are brought in and manipulated with two overhead cranes and a hoist capable of lifting up to 35 short tons  the hypergolic maintenance and checkout area comprises three buildings which are isolated from the rest of the industrial area because of the hazardous materials handled there hypergolic-fueled modules that made up the space shuttle orbiters reaction control system orbital maneuvering system and auxiliary power units were stored and serviced in the HMCF.40  launch complex 39edit  main article kennedy space center launch complex 39  the vehicle assembly building in 1999, with the launch control center jutting out from its right and pads a and b in the distance  launch complex 39 was originally built for the saturn v the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history for the apollo manned moon landing program since the end of the apollo program in 1972, LC-39 has been used to launch every nasa human space flight including skylab the apollo-soyuz test project and the space shuttle program  since december 1968, all launch operations have been conducted from launch pads a and b at LC-39. both pads are on the ocean 3 miles east of the vab from 19691972, LC-39 was the departure point for all six apollo manned moon landing missions using the saturn v and was used from 19812011 for all space shuttle launches  human missions to the moon required the large three-stage saturn v rocket which was 363 feet meters tall and 33 feet meters in diameter at ksc launch complex 39 was built on merritt island to accommodate the new rocket construction of the project began in november 1962. LC-39 pads a and b were completed by october 1965 pads c d and e were canceled the vab was completed in june 1965, and the infrastructure by late 1966.  the complex includes  the vehicle assembly building a 130,000,000 cubic feet hangar capable of holding four saturn vs the vab is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume and was the largest when completed in 1965.41  a transporter

explorer a space shuttle mock-up is in the background  the kennedy space center visitor complex operated by delaware north since 1995, has a variety of exhibits artifacts displays and attractions on the history and future of human and robotic spaceflight bus tours of ksc originate from here the complex also includes the separate apollosaturn v center north of the vab and the united states astronaut hall of fame six miles west near titusville there were 1.5million visitors in 2009. it had some 700 employees.48  it was announced on may 29, 2015 that the astronaut hall of fame exhibit would be moved from its current location to another location within the visitor complex to make room for an upcoming high-tech attraction entitled and legends the attraction to be designed by orlando-based design firm falcons treehouse is slated to open sometime late 2016.49  in march 2016, the visitor center unveiled the new location of the iconic countdown clock at the complexs entrance previously the clock was located with a flagpole at the press site the clock was originally built and installed in 1969 and listed with the flagpole in the national register of historic places in

september 7, 2004.  floridas peninsular shape and temperature contrasts between land and ocean provide ideal conditions for electrical storms earning central florida the reputation as capital of the united States.5556 this makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees structures and spacecraft on launch pads.57 on november 14, 1969, apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift-off from pad 39A, but the flight continued safely the most powerful lightning strike recorded at ksc occurred at LC-39B on august 25, 2006, while shuttle atlantis was being prepared for STS-115. nasa managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to atlantis but none was found.58  on september 7, 2004, hurricane frances directly hit the area with sustained winds of 70 miles per hour and gusts up to 94 miles per hour the most damaging storm to date the vehicle assembly building lost 1,000 exterior panels each 3.9 feet x 9.8 feet in size this exposed 39,800sqft of the building to the elements damage occurred to the south and east sides of the vab the shuttles thermal protection system facility suffered extensive damage the roof was partially torn off and the interior suffered water damage several rockets on display in the center were toppled.59 further damage to ksc was caused by hurricane wilma in october 2005.  ksc

with it  in may 1965, ksc had 7,000 employees and contractors move from rented space in cocoa beach to the new merritt island facilities the peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968 were civil servants in 1970, president nixon announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at ksc by 1974, kscs workforce was down to 10,000 employees civil servants.6  a total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government the rest are contractors.70 the average annual salary for an on-site worker in 2008 was  the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, preceded by the cancellation of constellation program in 2010, produced a significant downsizing of the ksc workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the apollo program in 1972. as part of this downsizing 6,000 contractors lost their jobs at the center during 2010 and 2011.72  see alsoedit  florida portal  government of the united states
