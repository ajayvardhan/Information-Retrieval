scale  tropical depression thirteen formed on October22 over the southwestern caribbean sea from a tropical wave that exited africa on October10. it executed a small loop and while doing so intensified into tropical storm mitch a weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north after becoming disorganized due to wind shear from an upper-level low mitch quickly intensified in response to favorable conditions,1 including warm waters and good outflow.23 it became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye.4 after turning to the west mitch rapidly intensified first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the next day.1  at peak intensity mitch maintained maximum sustained winds of 180mph while off the northern coast of honduras hurricane hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of 905mbar which at the time was the lowest in the month of october and tied for the fourth lowest for any atlantic hurricane initially the national hurricane center and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north threatening the yucatn peninsula instead mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active.1 land interaction imparted weakening,5 and the hurricane made landfall on honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph mitch slowly weakened while turning to the west over land maintaining deep convection over waters.6 after moving across mountainous terrain in central america the surface circulation of mitch dissipated on November1. the next day the remnants reached the gulf of mexico which reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front moving across the yucatn peninsula before striking near naples florida on November5. shortly thereafter the storm became an extratropical cyclone which was tracked by the nhc until November9.1  preparationsedit  due to the threat the government of honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the bay islands and prepared all air and naval resources the government of belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands to leave for the mainland.7 because the hurricane threatened to strike near belize city as a Category4 hurricane much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of hurricane hattie 37years earlier.8 guatemala issued a purple alert as well recommending boats to stay in port telling people to prepare or seek shelter and warning of potential overflowing rivers.7 by the time hurricane mitch made landfall numerous people were evacuated along the western caribbean coastline including 100,000 in honduras 10,000 in guatemala and 20,000 in the

hurricane of 1900 as the second-deadliest on record nearly 11,000 people were confirmed dead and almost as many reported missing deaths were mostly from flooding and mudslides in central america where the slow-moving hurricane and then tropical storm dropped nearly 36 inches of rain the flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes with total damage amounting to over 2006USD, most of which was in honduras and nicaragua prior to mitch the deadliest hurricane in central america was hurricane fifi in 1974, which killed an estimated 8,00010,000.1  hondurasedit  main article effects of hurricane mitch in honduras  while offshore northern honduras hurricane mitch passed over guanaja island.1 high waves eroded northern coastlines and damaged lagoons.16 most of the bay islands had damage to their water facilities.17 two days of winds exceeding 200kmh destroyed nearly all of the plants and trees on guanaja uprooting or knocking down almost the entire mangrove forest.18 it is estimated that the hurricane produced waves of 44ft in height.19  damage in tegucigalpa  while moving slowly for several days offshore honduras hurricane mitch drew moisture from the pacific ocean and the caribbean sea producing high amounts of rainfall of over 300mm per day.8 the highest official total was 928mm at choluteca which represented more than half of the annual precipitation average at the same location 466.7mm fell in a 24-hour period on October31, which was more than double of the previous record set in 1985.20 there were unofficial rainfall totals in central america as high as 1,900mm rain gauges in mountainous areas were washed away.8 the high rainfall caused many rivers in the country to overflow an unprecedented extent this century as described by the united Nations.20 the rainfall collected in rivers causing extensive river flooding across the country the greatest depth recorded was 12.5m on the ula river near chinda whilst the greatest width recorded was 359m on the ro lean near arizona the rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous country.21 in the countrys interior particularly the southern portion the high rainfall caused hundreds of landslides many of them shallow and about 95 in the form of debris flow however two earthflows caused significant damage near Tegucigalpa.22  mudslide in san juancito honduras  hurricane mitch wrought significant damage to honduras affecting nearly the entire population and causing damage in all 18 departments.20 the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean estimated that mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country.16 an estimated 7080 of transportation network was destroyed including most bridges and secondary roads,8 amounting to in damage hurricane mitch left widespread power outages after damaging more than 385km of power lines and several power plants.16 about 70 of honduras lost access to fresh water after the storm although many rural areas had already been experiencing water shortages.20 the combined damage to transportation communication utilities including power and water was estimated at  high water levels along the choluteca river affected the capital Tegucigalpa,17 reaching levels 10m above their banks.20 the floods damaged about one-third of buildings including some more than 350years old.8 across honduras agriculture sustained serious damage with initial estimates of 70 of crops destroyed.8 about 50,000bovine were killed as were 60 of the fowl population.17 crop

50,000damaged,17 leaving 1.5millionpeople homeless about 20 of the total population.8 this was the highest number of victims from any natural disaster in hondurass history.20 overall hurricane mitch killed about 7,000people in Honduras,20 and damage was estimated at L52,345,000,000 of which was from direct damages and the remainder from indirect costs the overall impact represented about 70 of hondurass annual gross domestic product  nicaraguaedit  flooding in lake managua after the hurricane  though mitch never entered nicaragua its large circulation caused extensive rainfall with estimates of over 50 inches in some places as much as 25 inches of rain fell on coastal areas.23 the flank of the casita volcano failed and turned into a lahar from excessive rain the resulting mudslide ultimately covered an area 10miles long and 5miles wide.8  two million people in nicaragua were directly affected by the hurricane.8 across the country mitchs heavy rains damaged 17,600 houses and destroyed 23,900, displacing 368,300 of the population.24 340 schools and 90 health centers were severely damaged or destroyed sewage systems and the electricity subsector were severely damaged and combined with property damage totaled to  casita volcano in western nicaragua after deadly mudslide  transportation was greatly affected by the hurricane as well the rainfall left 70 of the roads unusable or destroyed and greatly damaged 92bridges.26 over 1,700miles of highways or access roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm especially in the northern part of the country and along portions of the pan-american highway total transportation damage amounted to agricultural losses were significant including the deaths of 50,000 animals mostly bovines crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well and combined with agricultural losses damage totaled to  the situation was further compounded by a total of 75,000 live land minesleft over from the contra insurgency of the 1980sthat were calculated to have been uprooted and relocated by the floodwaters.27  in all hurricane mitch caused at least 3,800 fatalities in nicaragua of which more than 2,000 were killed in the towns of el provenir and rolando rodriguez from the landslide at the casita volcano the mudslide buried at least four villages completely in several feet of mud throughout the entire country the

workers on the isle of youth and cayo largo del sur to leave for safer grounds.29  in jamaica where officials declared hurricane warnings 12hours prior to its closest approach,1 mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds for days strong waves hit western jamaica with wave heights unofficially estimated at nearly 7feet in height the rainfall in outer rainbands at times severe flooded many roads across the island and left them covered with debris one house in spanish town collapsed from the flooding leaving four homeless many other homes and buildings were flooded forcing many to evacuate a river in northeastern jamaica overflowed its banks while heavy rainfall across the mountainous parts of the country caused numerous mudslides.30 in all mitch killed three people on Jamaica.8  on the cayman islands the hurricane caused strong waves gusty winds and heavy rainfall at times damage was relatively minimal amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion strong waves damaged or

atlantic hurricane names  because of the hurricanes destruction in central america and elsewhere in north america the world meteorological organization retired the name mitch in the spring of 1999 it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was replaced with matthew in the 2004 season which was itself retired after the 2016 season  after the disaster caused by hurricane mitch countries around the world donated significant aid totaling throughout central america which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy in addition after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.39  the run-off from mitch on november 1  hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses with a new structurally improved foundation homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane however lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many decreasing an already low income even lower.40  following the passage of mitch disease outbreaks occurred throughout central america including cholera leptospirosis and dengue fever over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported killing 34people. guatemala was most affected by the bacterium where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in nicaragua killing seven people there were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported though no deaths were reported from the disease.41  while stalling over the western caribbean sea mitchs strong winds produced strong waves damaging local coral reefs later the storms immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water this resulted in diseases occurring within the coral however the hurricanes upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef.42  mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that honduran president carlos roberto flores claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country.8 honduras the country most affected by the hurricane received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane mexico quickly gave help sending 700tons of food 11tons of medicine four rescue planes rescue personnel and trained search dogs cuba also volunteered sending a contingent of physicians to the country.43 the us administration offered at first troops stationed in honduras and then withdrew them a few days after the storm they also at first offered only in aid which came as a shock to residents and president carlos roberto flores alike the us later increased their offer to the honduran government distributed food water and medical services to the hurricane victims including the more than 4million without water.39 in addition the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate largely due to the destruction of crop lands however rebuilding provided jobs in the following years.15 in costa rica reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.11  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  1990s portal  list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes  list of deadliest atlantic hurricanes  list of retired
