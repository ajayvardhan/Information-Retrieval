county of washington dc since 2008, it has rivaled the university county of monongalia as the most democratic part of the state for much of the 20th century the county trended strongly democratic due to historical sympathies for confederate virginia in contrast to its rock-ribbed unionist and republican eastern panhandle sister morgan county jefferson did not vote republican until dwight d eisenhower won by twenty-seven votes in 1956, and afterwards voted republican only in the 1972 and 1984 landslides and in 1988.  communitiesedit  citiesedit  charles town seat  ranson  townsedit
