administrators and officials at the college of william and mary in the first decades of the twentieth century notable among these men were robert m hughes a wm board of visitors member from 18931917, and jac chandler the 18th president of that school.78 in 1924 after becoming the director of the william and mary extension in norfolk joseph healy began organizing classes and finding locations for faculty and staff he along with the collective efforts of robert m hughes dr jac chandler and ah foreman a two-year branch division was established on march 13, 1930.79 on september 12, 1930 the norfolk division of the college of william and mary held their first class with 206 students men and 81 women in the old larchmont school building which was an abandoned elementary school on hampton boulevard on september 3, 1930 h edgar timmerman becomes the divisions first director.10  original sign from the norfolk division  division as it was affectionately called which started out in the old larchmont school building and allowed people with less means to attend a school of higher education for two years.7 tuition for the first year was 50 USD.7 the following september virginia polytechnic institute more commonly known as virginia tech began offering classes at division expanding the number of courses taught.7 old dominion began educating teachers and engineers created in the first year

1946 webb was appointed director of the norfolk division dr webbs dream was to see the norfolk division become an independent institution the two-year norfolk division rapidly evolved into a four-year institution and he saw that dream fulfilled in 1962 when the norfolk division gained its independence from william and mary on february 16, 1962, the william and mary system was dissolved under
