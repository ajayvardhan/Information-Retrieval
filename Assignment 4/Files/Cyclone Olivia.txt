highest non-tornadic winds on record on barrow island 408 kilometres per hour breaking the record of 372kmh on mount washington in the united states in april 1934. the 13th named storm of the 199596 australian region cyclone season olivia formed on 3 april 1996 to the north of australias northern territory the storm moved generally to the southwest gradually intensifying off western australia on 8April, olivia intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and subsequently turned more to the south steered by a passing trough on 10April, olivia produced the worldwide record strongest gust on barrow island and on the same day the cyclone made landfall near varanus island the storm quickly weakened over land dissipating over the great australian bight on 12April.  while in its formative stages olivia produced light rainfall in the northern territory while offshore western australia the cyclone forced oil platforms to shut down and the combination of high winds and waves caused heavy damage to oil facilities onshore olivias high winds damaged several small mining towns halting operations every house in pannawonica sustained some damage one person in the town was injured by flying glass and had to be flown to receive treatment and nine others were lightly injured the cyclone also produced heavy rainfall and a localized storm surge damage was estimated the millions while the storm was dissipating rough seas in south australia killed A60million worth of farm-raised tuna at port lincoln the name olivia was retired after the season  contents  1 meteorological history  2

early april 1996, a surge in the trade winds interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of convection.1 on 2April, the bureau of meteorology first identified the system as a low to mid-level low pressure area over indonesia north of darwin australia despite strong wind shear the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward,2 aided by improving upper-level outflow.1 early on 5April, the joint typhoon warning center classified the system as tropical cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track,3 steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south.2 shortly thereafter the bom upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone designating the storm as tropical cyclone Olivia.24  in the days following olivias development persistent wind shear prevented convection from developing around the center of circulation by 8April, an upper-level trough passed to the south of the nascent cyclone leading to lower shear.2 following this the system had developed sufficiently for the jtwc to upgrade it to a Category1 equivalent on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale estimating 1minute sustained winds of 120kmh around the same time the bom upgraded olivia to a severe tropical cyclone assessing similar wind speeds but sustained over 10minutes.24 after the storm reached this intensity the mid-level ridge south of the cyclone began to weaken turning olivia toward the southwest by 9April, the system attained Category4 intensity according to the bom as it continued to strengthen.2 during the afternoon of 9April, the bom estimated that olivia attained its lowest barometric pressure of 925hPa along with 10minute sustained winds of 195kmh around 0000UTC on 10April, the jtwc assessed the cyclone to have attained 1minute winds of 230kmh equivalent to a Category4 on the SSHS.3 by this time another trough bypassed the cyclone causing olivia to turn to the south and accelerate to the southeast early on 10April, data from a nearby weather radar at the learmonth airport near exmouth western australia showed that the storm had developed a 65km wide eye.2  late on 10April, the center of olivia passed near barrow island at peak intensity shortly thereafter the storm passed near varanus island as a high-end Category4 or low-end Category5 cyclone.45 within several hours of passing by varanus island olivia made landfall near mardie at peak intensity.2 shortly thereafter the storm began to weaken overland accelerating to the southeast the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force.4 during the afternoon of 11April, olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern australia it moved over the great australian bight and lost its identity as a gale-force low on 12April,2 after it was absorbed by a trough.6  impact and aftermathedit  as a minimal cyclone in the timor sea olivia brought minor rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the northern Territory.7 on 9April, the fringes of the storm dropped 84mm in the kimberley region of western Australia.8 an oil rig in the timor sea recorded a wind gust of 127kmh during the storms passage.7 offshore olivia affected the southern portion of australias northwest shelf which had 24oil and gas facilities.9 the storm produced large swells up to 21m in conjunction with extreme wind gusts 265kmh waves toppled an oil drilling structure about 40km northeast of barrow island the first of its kind to fail since the 1980s. the waves also wrecked several anchors for underwater pipelines although no lines were ruptured on barrow island the winds knocked over 30pumpjacks,9 and several buildings and instruments were damaged while high waves incurred beach erosion.8 damage to offshore platforms was estimated in the millions of dollars.2  a group of 17people, initially considered missing,10 rode out the storm on the offshore mackerel island onshore officials closed a portion of highway 1 as well as other roads in the area.11 ahead of the storm hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes as well as an aborigine village near onslow were ordered to evacuate to safer locations.1213 five iron mines were closed during the storms passage forcing the 1,500workers to return home.14 the disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production.15 about 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms oil fields reopened by 14April.16  moving ashore western australia olivia produced peak gusts of 257kmh in mardie Station,14 the stations second-highest wind gust from a tropical cyclone.2 olivia also produced gusts of 267kmh at varanus island which was the highest wind gust on record in Australia,2 until the higher reading on barrow island during the storm was confirmed.17 it broke the previous peak of 259kmh set by cyclone trixie in 1975,18 and was later matched by cyclone vance in 1999.5 the high winds at mardie station damaged the local airport hangar and several windmills.14 farther inland olivia still produced wind gusts of 158kmh in pannawonica which damaged many roofs trees and power lines the towns police station and medical center lost their roofs during the storm,19 and every house sustained some damage.20 of the 82houses in the small town 55 lost their roof it was estimated that pannawonica would remain without power for three weeks one person in town was injured by flying broken glass who had to be airlifted to karratha for medical attention in nearby yarraloola nearly every building was damaged and the roofs of several farm buildings were ripped off several other small towns in the region sustained damage to roofs power lines and trees,21 and a 24year old roadhouse was destroyed along the fortescue River.22 olivia also dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 167mm in red hill although flooding was not significant.6 the storm also produced a 2m storm surge in localized areas.7 at the port of dampier the storm sank three boats although no one was aboard.21 damage was estimated in the of dollars according to a local newspaper,14 and overall 10people were injured.23  as the remnants of olivia moved through australia they dropped heavy rainfall and brought gusty winds to south australia cape willoughby recorded gusts of 106kmh on 12April, strong enough to knock down tree branches on nearby kangaroo Island.8 at port lincoln sediment stirred up by olivias remnants killed 60,000farmed tuna worth about A60million the fish were in cages and died due to abnormally high oxygen levels in the water caused by olivias high winds and rough waves.24 the remnants of olivia later brought rainfall to the states of victoria and Tasmania.8  the name was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names for the australian region.25 after the storms passage the royal australian air force flew six generators to pannawonica after the town was out of power for two nights,26 and the western australian government sent another 13generators.27 residents in the town received counseling to cope with the stress of the storms aftermath.21  recordsedit  at 1055UTC on 10April 1996 along the offshore barrow island an automatic privately operated anemometer recorded a three-second wind gust of 408kmh at a position 10m above sea level the bom was initially unsure of the veracity of the reading although a team at the 1999 offshore technology conference presented the reading as the highest wind gust on Earth.17 in 2009, the world meteorological organization commission for climatology researched whether hurricane gustav in 2008 produced a record 340kmh gust on pinar del rio Cuba28 one committee member recalled the gust set during olivia which spurred the investigation the reading occurred along the western edge of the eyewall possibly related to mesovortices based on other similarly high wind gusts during olivia 369kmh and 374kmh observed within five minutes of the record gust the team confirmed that the instrument was observing properly during the storm the same anemometer also recorded five-minute sustained winds of 178kmh causing a much greater than normal ratio of gusts to sustained winds the team confirmed that the instrument was regularly inspected and calibrated and that the reading was during the passage of the eyewall.17  on 26January 2010, nearly 14years later the world meteorological organization announced that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide this gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372kmh on mount washington in the united states in april 1934.29 the long delay was partly due to the anemometer not being owned by the bom and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation despite the high winds the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short time.17  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  1999 bridge creek-moore tornado an F5 tornado in the united states which had winds measured at 30120mph by a doppler
