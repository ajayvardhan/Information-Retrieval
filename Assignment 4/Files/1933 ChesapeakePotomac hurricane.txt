among the most damaging hurricanes in the mid-atlantic states in the eastern united states the sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 atlantic hurricane season it formed in the eastern atlantic where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scalenb 1 a strong ridge over new england allowed a continued northwest course bringing the storm south of bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern united states advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall it did so in northeastern north carolina on August23 with winds of about 90mph soon after the eye crossed over norfolk virginia the first time that happened since 1821. the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern virginia shortly before passing near washington dc becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. curving northward the storm moved through pennsylvania and new york before losing tropical characteristics on August25. now extratropical the former hurricane moved across atlantic canada dissipating on August28.  across the eastern united states the hurricane left widespread damage amounting to over to about in 2016 and causing 47deaths.nb 2 although the storm struck north carolina damage in the state totaled only about largely to crops and transport along the chesapeake bay the storm produced 100-year flooding from its storm surge setting records that remained for over 80years. in virginia flooding covered downtown portions of norfolk in the southeast and alexandria in the north damage in the state was estimated at similarly heavy damage occurred in maryland including over to crops high waves along the coast eroded beaches and created a new inlet at ocean city the highest rainfall associated with the hurricane was 13.28in at york pennsylvania in the state the rains flooded several rivers which forced thousands to evacuate in neighboring new jersey high waves wrecked boats and destroyed a fishing pier while in new york flooding caused traffic jams in atlantic canada heavy rainfall assisted firefighters in combating wildfires and the associated winds caused isolated power outages  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations and impact  2.1 north carolina and virginia  2.2 maryland north  3 see also  4 notes  5 references  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on August13, a tropical depression developed near the west coast of africa southeast of cape verde with an associated closed circulation based on observations from a nearby ship it is estimated the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm while moving generally to the west-northwest for several days the storm continued this general trajectory eventually shifting more to the northwest based on interpolation of reports it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on August16 while halfway between africa and the lesser Antilles.4 the weather bureau began tracking the system on August18.5 later that day a ship reported a pressure of 948mbar suggesting winds of 135mph this made the hurricane a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale another ship report on August20 indicated a pressure of 940mbar while reporting hurricane winds suggesting peak winds of 140mph  after remaining near peak intensity for three days the hurricane began steadily weakening while curving more to the west-northwest,4 a rare track for the region due to steering from a ridge over new England.6 on August21, the storm passed about 150mi southwest of bermuda at 1000UTC on August23, the hurricane made landfall along the northern outer banks of north Carolina,4 near nags Head,1 with a pressure of 963mbar based on the steady weakening coastal observations and a larger than normal size landfall winds were estimated at 90mph a few hours later the hurricane made another landfall on the north carolina mainland after crossing the albemarle sound while the hurricane continued to the northwest the eye briefly moved over norfolk Virginia,4 for the first time since the 1821 norfolk and long island hurricane.1 early on August24, the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm while passing near washington dc curving to the north the storm crossed pennsylvania and into new york where it weakened further into a tropical depression on August25, the former hurricane turned to the east near the canadaus border and after interacting with a cold front became extratropical it emerged from maine and briefly re-intensified moving across southern nova scotia with gale force winds on August28, the circulation dissipated to the south of Newfoundland.4  preparations and impactedit  track of the 1933 hurricane across virginia and maryland  the hurricane first affected bermuda when it passed to the south winds at st georges reached 64mph high waves along the coast prevented boats from docking.7  early on August21, the weather bureau issued storm warnings from cape hatteras to boston massachusetts as the hurricane approached land

a larger portion of the northeastern united states than any other hurricane in the 1900s after hurricane agnes in 1972.6 the federal emergency management agency later used high water levels from the storm as a 100-year event for the chesapeake bay region the next storm to approach the storm surge levels was isabel in 2003, which was lower in most locations in Virginia,10 although higher in washington dc and baltimore due to sea level rise.11 this hurricane caused damage from north carolina through new jersey due to the combination of high winds and storm tides,5 and left 47people dead overall.6  north carolina and virginiaedit  when the hurricane made landfall in the outer banks it produced winds of 76mph at cape Hatteras.4 the winds caused crop damage as far inland as granville
