azores high  the azores high anticiclone dos aores also known as north atlantic highanticyclone or the bermuda-azores high is a large subtropical semi-permanent centre of high atmospheric pressure typically found south of the azores in the atlantic ocean at the horse latitudes it forms one pole of the north atlantic oscillation the other being the icelandic low the system influences the weather and climatic patterns of vast areas of north africa and southern europe and to a lesser extent eastern north america the aridity of the sahara desert and the summer drought of the mediterranean basin is due to the large-scale subsidence and sinking motion of air in the system in its summer position bermuda high the high is centered near bermuda and creates a southwest flow of warm tropical air toward the east coast of the united states in summer the azores-bermuda high is strongest the central pressure hovers around 1024 mbar  tropical wave formation on the atlantic ocean  this high-pressure block exhibits anticyclonic nature circulating the air clockwise due to this direction of movement african eastern waves are impelled along the southern periphery of the azores high away from coastal west africa towards the caribbean central america or the bahamas favouring tropical cyclogenesis especially during the hurricane season  variationsedit  see also north atlantic oscillation and tropical upper tropospheric trough  research into global warming suggests that it may be intensifying the bermuda high in some years independently of oscillations such as enso leading to more precipitation extremes across the southeastern united states latitudinal displacement of the ridge is also occurring and computer models depict more westward expansion of the anticyclone in the future.12 however during the winter of 20092010, the azores high was smaller displaced to the northeast and weaker than usual allowing sea surface temperatures in the central atlantic to increase quickly.3  see alsoedit  hadley cell  cold front  mediterranean tropical cyclone  referencesedit  azores high weatheronline weather facts retrieved 2006-11-19.  high glossary of meteorology american meteorological society archived from the original on 26 october 2006. retrieved 2006-11-19.  high glossary of meteorology american meteorological society archived from the original on 19 october 2006. retrieved 2006-11-19.  lucas tim southeast summer rainfall linked to climate change duke university eurekalert archived from the original on 30 october 2010. retrieved 29 october 2010.  li wenhong laifang li rong fu yi deng hui wang 4, 2010. to the north atlantic subtropical high and its role in the intensification of summer rainfall variability in the southeastern united states american meteorological society 24 14991506.
