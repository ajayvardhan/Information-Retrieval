relatively high temperatures the same relationships hold true for any temperature down to absolute zero visible light is between 380 and 750 nm  thermal radiation in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork its emission in the infrared is invisible to the human eye and the camera the image was taken with but an infrared camera could show it thermography  thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter all matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation when the temperature of a body is greater than absolute zero inter-atomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change this results in charge-acceleration andor dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperature  examples of thermal radiation include the visible light and infrared light emitted by an incandescent light bulb the infrared radiation emitted by animals that is detectable with an infrared camera and the cosmic microwave background radiation thermal radiation is different from thermal convection and thermal conductiona person near a raging bonfire feels radiant heating from the fire even if the surrounding air is very cold  sunlight is part of thermal radiation generated by the hot plasma of the sun the earth also emits thermal radiation but at a much lower intensity and different spectral distribution rather than visible because it is cooler the earths absorption of solar radiation followed by its outgoing thermal radiation have been held to be the two most important processes that determine the temperature and climate of the earth in most climate models however radiant-heat trapping by freely convective gases has never been demonstrated experimentally1.  if a radiation-emitting object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium the radiation is called blackbody radiation.2 plancks law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation which depends only on the objects temperature wiens displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation and the stefanboltzmann law gives the radiant intensity.3  thermal radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat

emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero.4 it represents a conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy thermal energy consists of the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter all matter with a temperature by definition is composed of particles which have kinetic energy and which interact with each other these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ie protons and electrons and kinetic interactions among matter particles result in charge-acceleration and dipole-oscillation this results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields resulting in the emission of photons radiating energy away from the body through its surface boundary electromagnetic radiation including light does not require the presence of matter to propagate and travels in the vacuum of space infinitely far if unobstructed  the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface it is emanating from including its temperature its spectral absorptivity and spectral emissive power as expressed by kirchhoffs law.4 the radiation is not monochromatic ie it does not consist of just a single frequency but comprises a continuous dispersion of photon energies its characteristic spectrum if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths it is characterized as a black body a black body is also a perfect emitter the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation the ratio of any bodys emission relative to that of a black body is the bodys emissivity so that a black body has an emissivity of unity  absorptivity reflectivity and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation for example fresh snow which is highly reflective to visible light about 0.90, appears white due to reflecting sunlight with a peak wavelength of about 0.5 micrometers its emissivity at a temperature of about 5C peak wavelength of about 12 micrometers is 0.99.  the distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by plancks law at any given temperature there is a frequency fmax at which the power emitted is a maximum wiens displacement law and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength indicates that the peak frequency fmax is proportional to the absolute temperature t of the black body the photosphere of the sun at a temperature of approximately 6000 k emits radiation principally in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum earths atmosphere is partly transparent to visible light and the light reaching the surface is absorbed or reflected earths surface emits the absorbed radiation approximating the behavior of a black body at 300K with spectral peak at fmax at these lower frequencies the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earths surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere though some radiation escapes into space most is absorbed and then re-emitted by atmospheric gases it is this spectral selectivity of the atmosphere that is responsible for the planetary greenhouse effect contributing to global warming and climate change in general also critically contributing to climate stability when the composition and properties of the atmosphere are not changing  the incandescent light bulb has a spectrum overlapping the black body spectra of the sun and the earth some of the photons emitted by a tungsten light bulb filament at 3000K are in the visible spectrum most of the energy is associated with photons of longer wavelengths these do not help a person see but still transfer heat to the environment as can be deduced empirically by observing an incandescent light bulb whenever em radiation is emitted and then absorbed heat is transferred this principle is used in microwave ovens laser cutting and rf hair removal  unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer thermal radiation can be concentrated in a tiny spot by using reflecting mirrors concentrating solar power takes advantage of this fact in many such systems mirrors are employed to concentrate sunlight into a smaller area instead of mirrors fresnel lenses can also be used to concentrate heat flux principle any kind of lens can be used but only the fresnel lens design is practical for very large lenses either method can be used to quickly vaporize water into steam using sunlight for example the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the PS10 solar power plant and during the day it can heat water to 285C or 545F.  surface effectsedit  lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less illuminating light and thus heat up less but otherwise color makes small difference as regards heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings since the dominant emitted wavelengths are nowhere near the visible spectrum but rather in the far infrared emissivities at those wavelengths have little to do with visual emissivities colors in the far infra-red most objects have high emissivities thus except in sunlight the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth likewise paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlit  the main exception to this is shiny metal surfaces which have low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in the far infrared such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions an example of this is the multi-layer insulation used to insulate spacecraft  low-emissivity windows in houses are a more complicated technology since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light  nanostructures with spectrally selective thermal emittance properties offer numerous technological applications for energy generation and efficiency eg for cooling photovoltaic cells and buildings these applications require high emittance in the frequency range corresponding to the atmospheric transparency window in 8 to 13 micron wavelength range a selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sink  personalized cooling technology is another example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial conventional personal cooling is typically achieved through heat conduction and convection however the human body is a very efficient emitter of ir radiation which provides additional cooling mechanism most conventional fabrics are opaque to ir radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable ir transmission to directly pass through clothing while being opaque at visible wavelengths fabrics that are transparent in the infrared can radiate body heat at rates that will significantly reduce the burden on power-hungry air-conditioning systems  propertiesedit  there are four main properties that characterize thermal radiation the limit of the far field  thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies the frequency distribution is given by plancks law of black-body radiation for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at top  the dominant frequency color range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases for example a red hot object radiates mainly in the long wavelengths and orange of the visible band if it is heated further it also begins to emit discernible amounts of green and blue light and the spread of frequencies in the entire visible range cause it to appear white to the human eye it is white hot even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k 99 of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared this is determined by wiens displacement law in the diagram the peak value for each curve moves to the left as the temperature increases  the total amount of radiation of all frequencies increases steeply as the temperature rises it grows as T4, where t is the absolute temperature of the body an object at the temperature of a kitchen oven about twice the room temperature on the absolute temperature scale k vs 300 k radiates 16 times as much power per unit area an object at the temperature of the filament in an incandescent light bulbroughly 3000 k or 10 times room temperatureradiates 10,000 times as much energy per unit area the total radiative intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature as expressed by the stefanboltzmann law in the plot the area under each curve grows rapidly as the temperature increases  the rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source thus a surface that absorbs more red light thermally radiates more red light this principle applies to all properties of the wave including wavelength direction polarization and even coherence so that it is quite possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized coherent and directional though polarized and coherent forms are fairly rare in nature far from sources terms of wavelength see section below for more on this qualification  near-field and far-fieldedit  the general properties of thermal radiation as described by the plancks law apply if the linear dimension of all parts considered as well as radii of curvature of all surfaces are large compared with the wavelength of the ray considered from 8-25 micrometres for the emitter at 300 k indeed thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves or electromagnetic radiation into account a more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface thermal radiation for example although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent near-field thermal radiation radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence.5  plancks law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions this deviation is especially strong to several orders in magnitude when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects however to take advantage of the surface-polariton-mediated near-field radiative heat transfer the two objects need to be separated by ultra-narrow gaps on the order of microns or even nanometers this limitation significantly complicates practical device designs  another way to modify the object thermal emission spectrum is by reducing the dimensionality of the emitter itself this approach builds upon the concept of confining electrons in quantum wells wires and dots and tailors thermal emission by engineering confined photon states in two- and three-dimensional potential traps including wells wires and dots such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies to achieve the required level of photon confinement the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by plancks law most importantly the emission spectrum of thermal wells wires and dots deviates from plancks law predictions not only in the near field but also in the far field which significantly expands the range of their applications  subjective color to the eye of a black body thermal radiatoredit  c  subjective color6  480C  faint

energyedit  radiant heat panel for testing precisely quantified energy exposures at national research council near ottawa ontario canada  thermal radiation is one of the principal mechanisms of heat transfer it entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an objects temperature other mechanisms are convection and conduction the interplay of energy exchange by thermal radiation is characterized by the following equation  here represents the spectral absorption component spectral reflection component and the spectral transmission component these elements are a function of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation the spectral absorption is equal to the emissivity this relation is known as kirchhoffs law of thermal radiation an object is called a black body if for all frequencies the following formula applies  in a practical situation and room-temperature setting humans lose considerable energy due to thermal radiation the energy lost by emitting infrared radiation is partially regained by absorbing the heat flow due to conduction from surrounding objects and the remainder resulting from generated heat through metabolism human skin has an emissivity of very close to 1.0.9 using the formulas below shows a human having roughly 2 square meter in surface area and a temperature of about 307K, continuously radiates approximately 1000watts. if people are indoors surrounded by surfaces at 296K, they receive back about 900watts from the wall ceiling and other surroundings so the net loss is only about 100watts. these heat transfer estimates are highly dependent on extrinsic variables such as wearing clothes ie decreasing total thermal circuit conductivity therefore reducing total output heat flux only truly gray systems equivalent emissivityabsorptivity and no directional transmissivity dependence in all control volume bodies considered can achieve reasonable steady-state heat flux estimates through the stefan-boltzmann law encountering this calculable situation is almost impossible common engineering procedures surrender the dependency of these unknown variables and this to be the case optimistically these approximations will get close to real solutions as most divergence from stefan-boltzmann solutions is very small in most stp lab controlled environments  if objects appear white in the visual spectrum they are not necessarily equally reflective thus non-emissive in the thermal infrared most household radiators are painted white but this is sensible given that they are not hot enough to radiate any significant amount of heat and are not designed as thermal radiators at all they are actually convectors and painting them matt black would make little difference to their efficacy acrylic and urethane based white paints have 93 blackbody radiation efficiency at room temperature10 the term body does not always correspond to the visually perceived color of an object these materials that do not follow the color high emissivityabsorptivity caveat will most likely have functional spectral emissivityabsorptivity dependence  calculation of radiative heat transfer between groups of object including a or requires solution of a set of simultaneous equations using the radiosity method in these calculations the geometrical configuration of the problem is distilled to a set of numbers called view factors which give the proportion of radiation leaving any given surface that hits another specific surface these calculations are important in the fields of solar thermal energy boiler and furnace design and raytraced computer graphics  a comparison of a thermal image and an ordinary photograph shows that a trash bag is transparent but glass mans spectacles is opaque in long-wavelength infrared  a selective surface can be used when energy is being extracted from the sun for instance when a green house is made most of the roof and walls are made out of glass glass is transparent in the visible 0.4m0.8m and near-infrared wavelengths but opaque to mid- to far-wavelength infrared therefore glass lets in radiation in the visible range allowing us to be able to see through it but does not let out radiation that is emitted from objects at or close to room temperature this traps what we feel as heat this is known as the greenhouse effect and can be observed by getting into a car that has been sitting in the suncitation needed selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors we can find out how much help a selective surface coating is by looking at the equilibrium temperature of a plate that is being heated through solar radiation if the plate is receiving a solar irradiation of 1350Wm is 1325Wm on July4 and maximum is 1418Wm on January3 from the sun the temperature of the plate where the radiation leaving is equal to the radiation being received by the plate is 393K if the plate has a selective surface with an emissivity of 0.9 and a cut off wavelength of 2.0m, the equilibrium temperature is approximately 1250K the calculations were made neglecting convective heat transfer and neglecting the solar irradiation absorbed in the cloudsatmosphere for simplicity the theory is still the same for an actual problem  to reduce the heat transfer from a surface such as a glass window a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface low-emittance coatings are microscopically thin virtually invisible metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the u-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow.13 by adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window  radiative poweredit  power emitted by a black body plotted against the temperature according to the stefanboltzmann law  thermal radiation power of a black body per unit area of radiating surface per unit of solid angle and per unit frequency is given by plancks law as  or in terms of wavelength  where is a constant  this formula mathematically follows from calculation of spectral distribution of energy in quantized electromagnetic field which is in complete thermal equilibrium with the radiating object the equation is derived as an infinite sum over all possible frequencies the energy of each photon is multiplied by the number of states available at that frequency and the probability that each of those states will be occupied  integrating the above equation over the power output given by the stefanboltzmann law is obtained as  where the constant of proportionality is the stefanboltzmann constant and is the radiating surface area  the wavelength for which the emission intensity is highest is given by wiens displacement law as  for surfaces which are not black bodies one has to consider the frequency dependent emissivity factor this factor has to be multiplied with the radiation spectrum formula before integration if it is taken as a constant the resulting formula for the power output can be written in a way that contains as a factor  this type of theoretical model with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body is often known as a grey body for frequency-dependent emissivity the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence though in general there is no simple expression for it practically speaking if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral  constantsedit  definitions of constants used in
