year to strike the windward islands the nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 atlantic hurricane season tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the windward islands on October29. quickly intensifying into a hurricane it moved through the windward islands and passed over saint lucia after reaching Category2 status on the saffir-simpson scale tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central caribbean sea due to strong wind shear and dry air tomas later regained hurricane status as it reorganized near the windward passage  throughout the hurricanes path 71 people are known to have been killed 14 of whom were in saint lucia monetary losses throughout the windward islands were estimated at US588million, mainly in saint lucia in the wake of the storm in

retirement  5 see also  6 references  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a tropical wave or elongated low-pressure area exited the western coast of africa on October24.1 it moved hastily westward across the tropical atlantic at a comparatively low latitude becoming embedded within the intertropical convergence Zone.23 during this time the waves structure retained a vigorous appearance1 the western portion contained scattered convection with strong thunderstorms as well as a broad area of rotating winds.3 on October27, when the system was about 1,200miles east-southeast of the windward islands the national hurricane center noted favorable atmospheric conditions for tropical cyclogenesis namely light wind shear.4 the wave and its expansive convection amplified over the next two days featuring hints of spiraling rainbands.15 a hurricane hunters aircraft investigating the disturbance on October29 observed a developing circulation with storm-force winds at sea level.6 in light of those features the nhc estimated that the system became a tropical depression by 0600 utc that day about 460mi southeast of barbados and further upgraded it to tropical storm tomas six hours later.17  on its inception tomas turned toward the northwest and decelerated1 within a region of low wind shear and high tropical moisturetwo of the prime prerequisites of rapid intensification a misalignment between the cyclones low- and upper-level circulations impeded this strengthening potential however and at that time the nhc did not expect tomas to attain hurricane status until 36 to 48hours later.7 steered along high pressure to its north the storm retraced slightly west-northwestward on its approach to the windward Islands.18 despite the prior forecasts of moderated strengthening tomas winds sharply increased to 60mph by late October299 moreover the outflow aloft became well established in all quadrants as the convection consolidated into a prominent rain band.10 the center of the intensifying storm crossed southern barbados the next morning around 0900 UTC.1 radar images from martinique soon revealed the formation of an eye8 tomas attained hurricane status a couple of hours later about 35miles east of saint vincent and the grenadines after hurricane hunters recorded surface winds of 75mph by that time the eye measured 3546mi in diameter.11  a weakening tropical storm tomas over the atlantic on november 6  tomas continued to strengthen through October30 as it moved generally west- to west-northwestward around 2000UTC, the eye traversed the northern shores of saint vincent while the northernmost ring of the severest winds skirted saint Lucia.1 subsequent reports from hurricane hunters and post-storm reanalysis indicated that tomas had reached a peak intensity with wind speeds of 100mph and a minimum pressure of 982 mbar 29.00 inhg during its trek across the islands making it a Category2 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale.112 although the nhc noted the potential for tomas to become a major hurricane the agency conversely observed that the hurricane had begun to suffer from southwesterly wind shear which computer models forecast to increase in the long term.12 on October31, a combination of this shear and pockets of dry air dispersed the convection surrounding the eye initiating a weakening trend.13 tomas diminished to a tropical storm early on November1, when the strongest thunderstorms became dislocated from the low-level wind vortex by more than 115mi tomas meandered slightly south of west for a while passing north of the abc islands overnight.115 although the upper wind regime relaxed into the next day with an area of deep convection briefly reblossoming near tomas center,15 the shear appeared to have already taken its toll on the storm with an increasingly diffuse and elongated structure tomas further weakened to a tropical depression at 0000UTC, November3, about 325miles southeast of kingston Jamaica.116  following its deterioration tomas diverged toward the northwest over the central Caribbean.1 the circulation lost further definition adjoining a wide stretch of low pressures spanning the western caribbean a hurricane hunters mission to determine whether tomas retained its status as a tropical cyclone found that the mean low-level circulation had reformed to the northeast of the previous center tomas reattained tropical storm strength late on November3,1718 and although the low- and mid-level centers were initially nonaligned slow restrengthening ensued into the next day.19 tomas turned northward ahead of an unseasonably strong deep-layered trough circumnavigating the western periphery of the subtropical ridge.120 over a six-hour period the cyclones core thunderstorm activity became much more concentrated with a corresponding quick drop in central pressure.21 while turning northeastward into the windward passage tomas regained hurricane status around 0600UTC on November5, just 36miles west-southwest of the western tip of Haiti.122  over the course of November5, the hurricane accelerated northeastward in response to the approaching trough passing right between eastern cuba and western haiti due to its proximity to land the convection became disrupted near the center23 tomas reweakened to a tropical storm near the turks and caicos islands during a spell of moderate shear on November6.1 after moving through that island nation tomas briefly became a hurricane for a final time before hostile wind shear from the nearby trough fully began to take effect in conjunction with increasingly dry air the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm on November7. tomas lost its tropical characteristics the next day though it retained gale-force winds as an extratropical cyclone it turned sharply eastward before curving northward accelerated by a broad cyclonic steering flow over the western atlantic the next couple of days the thomas extratropical remnant subsequently raced off into the north atlantic until it was absorbed by another extratropical system a few hundred miles south of newfoundland canada on November11.1  preparationsedit  prior to the development of tomas the nhc noted the potential for heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts to spread across the windward islands venezuela and northern guyana due to the tropical wave of which later developed into hurricane Tomas.24 upon development of tropical storm tomas most of the windward islands were put under a tropical storm warning issued by their respective governments a tropical storm watch was also issued for Dominica.25 six hours later as tomas was nearly a hurricane the tropical storm warning was replaced by a hurricane warning in barbados st vincent and the grenadines st lucia and martinique the tropical storm watch in dominica was also upgraded to a tropical storm warning.26  in barbados people evacuated to schools and shelters for safety during the storm.27 on st lucia the government closed the islands two airports and ordered the closure of all businesses additionally a large creole festival was canceled due to the storm.28 officials in trinidad and tobago closed beaches across the country.29 in st vincent the national emergency management organization issued advisories that a tropical system was approaching the country the rapid intensification of tomas caught many citizens in st vincent off guard early on october 30, the prime minister addressed the nation and informed the country of the situation it was facing  following the west-southwesterly motion of the storm swells generated by tomas produced breaking waves on coastal sections of the abc islands during the morning of november 1. consequently a small craft advisory was issued at 1415 utc for all three islands.30 in addition a state of severe weather was declared for bonaire and curaao during the passage of Tomas.31 in haiti the country which was devastated earlier in the year from a deadly january 12 earthquake government officials began preparing for possible impact from tomas by October30. one united nations spokesperson remarked that a hurricane strike would be last thing haiti needs.27 the haitian government issued an orange storm alert one level short of the highest state of alert and warned for the possibility of winds thunderstorms and flooding.28  impactedit  impact by country or region  countyregion  deaths  damage  source  barbados  0  70068500000000000008.5million   cuba  0  1   curaao

passed 20 miles to the south of barbados it produced a wind gust of 63mph which damaged homes and power lines on the island.34 there were also reports of blown off roofs impassable roads and uprooted trees.35 later a station on saint lucia recorded sustained winds of 48mph with gusts to 69mph there was widespread damage to homes and power lines.37 the winds destroyed the roof of a hospital and a school with several trees and power lines blown down.28 additionally a station on martinique reported sustained winds of 72mph with gusts to 108mph  on saint vincent there were no deaths but two persons sustained serious injuries while trying to effect repairs to house roofs and two persons were reported missing the two persons reported missing were found on november 1, off the island of balliceaux the national emergency management organization declared all areas from park hill to owia on the eastern side and all areas from belle isle to fitz hughes on the western side disaster zones it was also reported that the agriculture sector sustained over US25millionEC67million worth of damage over 1200 people were forced to seek refuge in hurricane shelters across st vincent about 600 houses lost their roofs a lot of downed power lines trees and landslides made some roads impassable but nemo the bridges roads and general services authority and the st vincent electricity services company were able to clear the main road by the november 1.  saint lucia arguably had sustained the worst damage from the storm overall throughout saint lucia severe flooding and mudslides resulted in at least 7 fatalities confirmed by the chief medical officer according to a government minister several other people were missing and buried in landslides.39 by the morning of November2, two more fatalities were confirmed on the island.40  other caribbean islandsedit  tropical storm tomas reorganizing over the caribbean sea on November4  while passing the windward islands into the caribbean sea tomas produced strong winds and heavy rainfall on isla aves located off the northern coast of Venezuela.27  although the storm did not directly strike the abc islands one of its outer rainbands stalled over the region and intensified during the night of November1 to November2. curaao experienced its most extreme rain event in 40years as many as 10.4 inches were recorded over a 24-hour period in the eastern part of the island.41 the majority of the rain fell overnight in a heavy downpour accompanied by a severe thunderstorm that triggered large-scale power tv and radio outages.4243 lightning strikes sparked three large fires in a major oil refinery in willemstad the fires inflicted severe damage to several tanks estimated at US10million.44 flights from curaao international airport were delayed due to the hazardous conditions.45  following hours of heavy rainfall widespread floods made most roads in the region impassable with dozens of cars swept away or stranded.42 the rains filled dams and overwhelmed drains causing them to overflow and exacerbating the flooding.46 the towns of salia brievengat and mahaai were among the hardest hit hundreds of homes gardens and businesses were inundated.4247 at the height of the rainstorm a rescue worker assisting in the evacuation of a hospital was killed by the collapse of a wall an elderly man suffering a heart attack drowned while unable to exit his flooded car.48 overall curaao suffered some of its worst flooding in history insured losses across the island exceeded NA110million though total damage costs from tomas were estimated at NA200million  damage on the other two islands was much more limited parts of bonaire experienced heavy but brief periods of rain with a maximum of 3inches at flamingo international airport causing localized flooding of property on aruba some thunder and moderate rainfall occurred without significant consequences.41 all schools across the islands were closed on november 2 and 3 as a result of the storm.50  greater antillesedit  flooding from tomas in port-au-prince haiti on November6  after days of anticipation tomas arrived just offshore in haiti on the morning of November5. the storm intensified while brushing the disaster-weary nation reattaining hurricane strength near the westernmost tip of haiti torrential rains and tropical storm force winds buffeted the entire region within hours of the storms arrival flooding began to occur in earthquake-ravaged port-au-prince one of the largest refugee camps set up near the ruins of the capitol building was flooded following heavy rains.51 by the evening of November8, 20 people had been confirmed dead 7 others were listed as missing and more than 30,000 people were in shelters.52 health workers also feared damage related to tomas on the island could exacerbate the ongoing cholera outbreak.535455  hurricane tomas as it tracks across the greater antilles on November5  tomas passed just to the east of cuba hours later but no significant damage was reported on the island.56 as the outer bands of hurricane tomas began to impact cuba aero caribbean flight 883, an ATR-72-212 aircraft crashed near the town of guasimal in sancti spritus province all 68 people on board the plane were killed on impact although the plane was the last to leave the airport in santiago de cuba before it closed due to tomas it is unknown what role if any the storm played in the crash.5758 following a review of the crash it was determined that severe ice accumulation at an altitude of 20,000ft along with errors by the crew caused the incident.59  elsewhereedit  hurricane tomas narrowly missed the turks and caicos sparing the islands a direct hit and causing only minor flooding.60  aftermathedit  estimates place the cost of damage in barbados at BDS17million throughout the northern part of st vincent the entire banana crop was lost press reports from the prime minister revealed that nearly every banana tree had been downed during the storm the countrys banana crop is a major source of income and jobs accounting for roughly 60 of the workforce and 50 of the merchandise exported.62  damage from the storm on trinidad and tobago amounted to TT4million losses in barbados reached Bds17million the government of st lucia stated that damage from the storm could exceed US100million.65 by November5, the prime minister stated that damage from tomas was roughly EC1.3billion usd five times higher than initially stated.66  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  due to the extent of damage across the caribbean the name tomas was retired on march 16, 2011 by the world meteorological organization during their 33rd hurricane committee and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with tobias for the 2016 hurricane season.67 however the name was unused in 2016 season so it may be used in the 2022 season  see alsoedit  wikimedia
