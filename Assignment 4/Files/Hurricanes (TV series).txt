london even though it was unclear which kind of activities he develops there  wyn smithe and genghis khan wyn and genghis are stavros garkos best players and are the ones most often enlisted to assist stavros with his schemes it is rare to see the gorgons playing without them both except through injury and even rarer to see one of them appearing in an episode without the other one instance of this occurring is in when hurricanes collide when genghis appeared but wyn did notcitation needed even though stavros favours them they have little loyalty in return they once attempted to steal a gold mine so as to be able to stop working for stavroscitation needed  rebo rebos biggest role in stavros garkoss dirty schemes was in blood match when rebo stole dino allegros lucky charm damaging his

uncle in exchange of becoming the first female vice-president of garkos enterprises when the plan fails garkos says he wouldnt hire her even as a coffee-lady since shes single called ms and doesnt bear the name garkos we can assume spiro and melinda arent stavros garkoss only siblings  stavros garkos iv stavross namesake and look-alike great-grandson from the future stavros garkos had mortgaged all his companies to bet against the hurricanes and lost because of that all stavros iv inherited was his football team to revert this situation stavros iv sends a robot player named the relegator to change the game results stavros garkos was reluctant about this because he couldnt have a great-grandson for not even having grandchildren as he stated but he started believing when the bet he never expected to meet someone who already knew about was mentioned for a final test garkos asks the relegator what he thinks about rules and he says they must be broken this making stavros believe hes been sent by a garkos the robot fails and the plan b destroys a factory forcing garkos to pay for the damages creating an alternate future where stavros iv washes the hurricaness uniforms since this was a dream of napper thompson it doesnt affect the continuity of the series dream or not this is so far the strongest clue pointing stavros garkos as a father of at least one child  garkos enterprisesedit

americans  garkos finance company in techno-team this company helped stavros garkos to take over walker laboratories when its former owner mickey walker had missed the deadline to pay the mortgage
