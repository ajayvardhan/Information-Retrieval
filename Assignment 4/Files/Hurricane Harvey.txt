to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005, ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country in a four-day period many areas received more than 40 inches of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern texas and adjacent waters causing catastrophic flooding with peak accumulations of 64.58in harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the united states and the third-wettest on record in the atlantic basin behind hurricane flora of 1963 and a november hurricane in 1909. the resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes displaced more than 30,000people, and prompted more than 17,000rescues. a Category4 hurricane at its peak intensity it was the strongest and most intense hurricane in the gulf of mexico since rita in 2005.  the eighth named storm third hurricane and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 atlantic hurricane season harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the lesser antilles reaching tropical storm status on August17. the storm crossed through the windward islands on the following day passing just south of barbados and later near saint vincent upon entering the caribbean sea harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of colombia early on August19. the remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the caribbean and the yucatn peninsula before redeveloping over the bay of campeche on August23. harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August24, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day while the storm moved generally northwest harveys intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August2425 however harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category4 intensity later that day hours later harvey made landfall near rockport texas at peak intensity afterwards rapid weakening ensued and harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the lone star state on August28, it emerged back over the gulf of mexico strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in louisiana on August29. as harvey drifted inland it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September1, before dissipating two days later  harvey caused at least 91 confirmed deaths 1 in Guyana,1 and 90 in the united States.234567 total damage from the hurricane is estimated at making it the costliest natural disaster ever in the united States.8  contents  1 meteorological history  1.1 formation and initial degeneration  1.2 regeneration peak

early on August13, the national hurricane center began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of africa amid favorable environmental conditions the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure to its east southwest of cape verde and gradually organize thereafter.9 instead the two disturbances remained separate with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north eventually becoming potential tropical cyclone Ten.10 on August17, shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization,11 while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation.12 as such the nhc initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the lesser Antilles.13 an air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds prompting the nhc to upgrade it to tropical storm harvey at 2100UTC.14  following its designation the cyclone moved swiftly westward into the caribbean sea under the influence of an expansive ridge of high pressure to its north an environment of moderate wind shear complicated the weather of the storms intensity with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central caribbean whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days.14 over the next day the storm changed little in structure remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep convection.15 harveys presentation began to deteriorate early on August19 its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined in fact a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850mb though it did locate one at lower levels.16 harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 2100UTC on August1917 six hours later based on continued data from a reconnaissance aircraft it was declared an open tropical wave.18  the remnants of harvey as a tropical wave over the gulf of honduras on august 21, within the shadow of a total solar eclipse  early on August20, the nhc began monitoring the remnants of harvey for redevelopment although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern caribbean sea and especially in the bay of Campeche.19 despite an increase in convective organization the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the yucatn Peninsula.20 while traversing inland satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defined.21  regeneration peak intensity and stalling of mexicoedit  a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of harvey around 1500UTC on August23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center and the nhc upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly.22 the system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment,23 attaining tropical storm intensity by 0600UTC on August24.24 later that morning harvey began to undergo rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell.25 by 1700UTC, the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season.26 slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process however by the next day harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a Category3 major hurricane by 1900UTC.27 further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of texas with harvey becoming a Category4 hurricane at 2300UTC, based on reconnaissance aircraft data.28 around 0300UTC on August26, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at rockport with winds of 130mph and an atmospheric pressure of 938mbar harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since charley in 2004. it was the first hurricane to strike texas since hurricane ike in 2008,30 the first major hurricane in the state since bret in 1999, and the strongest in texas since carla in 1961.31  harvey as a hurricane on August24  after striking land the storm moved over the copano bay and made a second landfall in texas just north of holiday beach at 0600UTC on August26 as a Category3 hurricane.32 afterwards rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl and harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 1800UTC on August26.33 for about two days the storm stalled just inland dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding harveys center drifted back towards the southeast positioning itself near or just off the texas coast at matagorda by 1500 utc on august 28.34 once offshore convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured an air force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of August29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50mph around 0900UTC the next morning harvey made its third and final landfall just west of cameron louisiana with winds of 45mph  final landfall and dissipation united statesedit  the system continued north and then north-northeast weakening to a tropical depression over central louisiana around 0000UTC on August30.37 associated convection with harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September1, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 1500UTC that day.38 however harveys remnants continued moving northeastward while slowly weakening late on september 2, the wpc issued its final advisory on harveys remnant low while it was located over Ohio.39 harveys remnants continued to drift northward before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of lake erie late on september 3.40  preparationsedit  caribbean and latin

the texas rangers and tennessee titans both provided while the new england patriots pledged to match up to in donations to the red Cross.134 multiple hollywood celebrities also pitched in collectively donating more than with sandra bullock providing the largest single donation of leonardo dicaprio provided to the united way harvey recovery fund through his foundation.136 president donald trump reportedly donated to 12 charities involved in relief efforts.137 rachael ray provided donations totaling to animal shelters across the houston area.138  economic loss estimatesedit  president trump signs hr 601 into effect providing billion in disaster relief for hurricane victims  moodys analytics initially estimated the total economic cost of the storm at billion to billion or more most of the economic losses are damage to homes and commercial property.139 usa today reported an accuweather estimate of billion released august 31.140 on september 3, texas state governor greg abbott estimated that damages will be between and surpassing the that it took to rebuild new orleans after Katrina.141142 according to weather analytics firm planalytics lost revenue to houston area retailers and restaurants alone will be approximately billion the houston area controls 4 of the spending power in the united States.143  in september 2017, the insurance council of texas estimated the total insured losses from hurricane harvey at billion this figure represents billion in flood losses insured by the national flood insurance program billion in windstorm and other storm-related property losses and about billion in insured flood losses of private and commercial vehicles.144 in early november 2017, ball state university compiled a preliminary damage report for hurricane harvey with the total costs reaching at least billion usd this makes hurricane harvey the costliest tropical cyclone on record surpassing hurricane Katrina.8  a significant portion of the storms damages are uninsured losses regular homeowner insurance policies generally exclude coverage for flooding as the nfip underwrites most flood insurance policies in the US.145146 although the purchase of flood insurance is obligatory for federally guaranteed mortgages for homes within the 100-year flood plain enforcement of the requirement is difficult and many homes even within the 100-year flood plain lack flood insurance.145 in harris county texaswhich includes the city of houstononly 15 of homes have flood insurance policies issued by the nfip participation in the nfip is higher but still low in neighboring galveston brazoria and chambers counties homeowners sued authorities after reservoir releases damaged homes.147  federal government responseedit  on september 8, president donald trump signed into law hr 601, which among other spending actions designated billion for hurricane harvey relief.148  non-governmental organization responseedit  the american red cross salvation army united methodist committee on relief united states equestrian federation humane society of the united states knights of columbus catholic charities usa americares operation bbq relief many celebrities and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm anarchists antifa also provided relief.152 business aviation played a part in the rescue efforts providing support during the storm as well as relief flights bringing in suppliers in the immediate aftermath.153  volunteers from amateur radios emergency service wing the amateur radio emergency service provided communications in american red cross shelters in south texas  many corporations also contributed to relief efforts operation bbq relief had the help from several local individuals and businesses kick off the support of providing meals for volunteers and victims smokers pallets of wood and another company came up with the pounds of pork to kick off the support effort.155 although operation bbq relief has been in effect since may 2011 with the 2011 joplin tornado they estimate the houston 2017 relief project to be their biggest ever  operation bbq relief vendors volunteering for the houston flood relief estimates that they will serve at least 450,000 meals.156 on august 27, 2017 it was estimated that operation bbq relief will be expecting 25,000 to 30,000 meals a day.157  on august 27, 2017 ksl-tv ksl newsradio FM100.3, and 103.5 the arrow created a fundraiser to help texas residents impacted by hurricane harvey because of an anonymous donor willing to match for every raised up to a total of peter huntsman also agreed to match donations up to the combined total of was met by august 31, 2017. their new goal is million.158  foreign government responseedit  singapore dispatched boeing CH-47 chinook helicopters from the republic of singapore air force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations working alongside the texas national Guard.159 israel pledged million in relief funds for restoration of non-state run communal infrastructure.160 mexico sent volunteers from the mexican red cross firemen from coahuila and rescue teams from guanajuato to houston to assist in relief.161 mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after hurricane katia made landfall on mexicos gulf coast on september 9, 2017.162 venezuela offered million through the state-owned citgo petroleum which operates a refinery in corpus Christi.163  health and environmental hazards in flood watersedit  the floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health the houston health department stated that of contaminants were present in floodwaters.164 these include e coli and coliform bacteria measurements of colony-forming units showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting flesh-eating disease from the water.165  houston officials stated that the houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact however of thousands of people across the 38 texas counties affected by hurricane harvey use private wells according to an estimate by louisiana state university researchers and those people must fend for themselves.164 additionally harris county which includes houston contains a large number of superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens.164 two superfund sites in corpus christi were flooded.164  environmental factorsedit  the geography of houston places it in a low-lying part of the gulf coastal plain and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage the climate of houston brings very heavy rainfall which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836, though the flood control district founded in 1947, aided by the us army corps of engineers managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years more recently residents died in flooding in may 2015, and in the april 2016 day floods.166167 there is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period as occurred during tropical storm claudette in 1979, and tropical storm allison in 2001.168  the area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea the main waterways the san jacinto river and the buffalo bayou meander slowly laden with mud and have little capacity for carrying storm water.169  urban developmentedit  houston has seen rapid urban development sprawl with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels.170 between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons.171 however harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.172  the katy prairie in western harris county which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in harris county since 2010.173  subsidenceedit  extraction of oil and groundwater from underground aquifers leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse a process called subsidence houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence in some cases as much as 9 feet these result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently so storm water drains more slowly.174 the coastline near houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the effects of climate change.175174  climate changeedit  see also tropical cyclone climate change  the gulf of mexico is known for hurricanes in august so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall.176 weather events are due to multiple factors and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition but climate change affects aspects of extreme events and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey.177 in a briefing the world meteorological organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from harvey had very likely been increased by climate change the relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes tropical cyclones is still unclear and is the subject of continuing research.178  harvey approached houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger more intense and longer lasting in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall.179176 sea level rise added to the resulting problems.177 according to officials from the harris county flood control district harvey caused the third flood in three years the national climate assessment states  the recent increases in activity are linked in part to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that atlantic hurricanes form in and move through numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures including natural variability human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases and particulate pollution quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research.183  warmer air can hold more water vapour in accordance with the clausiusclapeyron relation and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records.177 regional sea surface temperatures around houston have risen around 0.5C in recent decades which caused a 35 increase in moisture in the atmosphere this had the effect of allowing harvey to strengthen more than expected.175 the water temperature of the gulf of mexico was above average for this time of the year and likely to be a factor in harveys impact.184 within a week of harvey hurricane irma formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water some scientists fear this may be becoming a normal also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating.185  the slow movement of harvey over texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state as has also happened with earlier storms.168 harveys stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the us at the time which had pushed the jet stream to the north research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change.175186  see alsoedit  list of category 4 atlantic hurricanes  list of texas hurricanes  list of costliest atlantic hurricanes  list of wettest tropical cyclones  hurricane irma another major
