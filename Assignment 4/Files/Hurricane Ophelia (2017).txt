while extratropical was the easternmost atlantic major hurricane on record the tenth consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active 2017 atlantic hurricane season ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 october located within a favorable environment the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 october after becoming a category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 october south of the azores brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall shortly after achieving peak intensity ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards ireland and great britain completing an extratropical transition early on 16 october ophelia became the second storm of the 201718 uk and ireland windstorm season early on 17 october the cyclone crossed the north sea and struck western norway with wind gusts up to 70 kilometres per hour in rogaland county before weakening during the evening the system made additional landfalls in sweden and finland before dissipating over russia  five deaths can be attributed to ophelia all of which occurred in ireland the total losses from the storm are estimated at 1 billion billion mostly from economic losses

and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on 6 october the united states national hurricane center began monitoring the tail end of a decaying cold front for possible subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis.1 on the same day a circulation developed on the periphery of this front.1 soon afterwards a non-tropical low developed within the circulation and drifted to the southwest before becoming nearly stationary.2 the system began to acquire subtropical characteristics on the next day and the chances of development were raised to a high percentage of cyclogenesis.3 after a brief loss of organization and diminished convection due to moderate wind shear,4 the system continued to steadily organize and developed a well-defined circulation center early on 9 october as deep convection began to persist near the center.5 by 0900UTC that day the convection had persisted long enough for the system to be classified as a tropical depression about 875mi west-southwest of the azores and the storm was identified as tropical depression Seventeen.67 a curved banding feature wrapped around the center as the satellite presentation improved leading to the upgrade to tropical storm ophelia six hours later.8  tropical depression seventeen organizing in the atlantic ocean on 9 october  despite marginally warm sea surface temperatures of around 79F the effects of below-average temperatures aloft and low wind shear allowed ophelia to gradually strengthen with banding features becoming more prominent as it drifted northwards in an area of weak steering currents.9 in addition the large temperature contrast between the ocean surface and extremely cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere allowed the storm to continue strengthening despite it being over normally suboptimal ocean temperatures.10 a slight degradation of the structure of the storm resulted in some weakening early on 11 October,11 but this was short-lived as deep convection wrapped around the entire storm it was upgraded to a hurricane at 2100UTC that day after a ragged eye developed becoming the record-tying tenth consecutive hurricane to form during the 2017 hurricane season ophelia was the fourth such occurrence since the 1878, 1886, and 1893 seasons.1213nb 1 afterwards ophelia steadily intensified as it became nearly stationary intensifying into a Category2 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale on 12 october as the central dense overcast became more symmetric and the eye became better defined.14  the hurricane then weakened slightly the on next day as cloud tops warmed,15 only to quickly strengthen as the eye became much more defined and cloud tops cooled significantly due to outflow from a strong trough to the northeast the nhc upgraded the storm to a major hurricane 3 or higher at 1500UTC on 14 october the farthest east that a storm of such intensity had been observed in the satellite era.1617 at the same time it attained its peak intensity with winds of 115mph and a minimum pressure of 960millibars while located approximately 235miles southeast of the azores after peaking in intensity increasing shear and dry air from an encroaching frontal boundary began to disrupt the core of the storm which caused ophelia to begin weakening early on 15 october as it began its extratropical transition with the eye collapsing.18 the process accelerated as ophelia became further embedded in the trough and ultimately the storm became extratropical at 0300UTC on the next day.19  preparations and impactedit  azoresedit  the portuguese institute of the sea and the atmosphere issued a red warning for heavy rainfall for the eastern group of the azoresso miguel santa maria and formigason 14 october from 1759UTC to 2359UTC.20 an orange gale warning was
