portions of southeast asia particularly the Philippines.1 it is the deadliest philippine typhoon on record,2 killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone.3 in terms of jtwc-estimated 1-minute sustained winds haiyan is tied with meranti for being the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record in january 2014, bodies were still being found.4  the thirtieth named storm of the 2013 pacific typhoon season haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of pohnpei in the federated states of micronesia on november 2, 2013. tracking generally westward environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression the following day after becoming a tropical storm and attaining the name haiyan at 0000 utc on november 4, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 1800 utc on november 5. by november 6, the joint typhoon warning center assessed the system as a category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale the storm passed over the island of kayangel in palau shortly after attaining this strength  thereafter it continued to intensify at 1200 utc on november 7, the japan meteorological agency upgraded the storms maximum ten-minute sustained winds to 230kmh the highest in relation to the cyclone the hong kong observatory put the storms maximum ten-minute sustained winds at 285kmh prior to landfall in the central philippines while the china meteorological administration estimated the maximum two-minute sustained winds at the time to be around 78ms or 175mph. at the same time the jtwc estimated the systems one-minute sustained winds to 315kmh unofficially making haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed based on wind speed a record which would then be surpassed by hurricane patricia in 2015 at 345kmh haiyan is also tied with typhoon meranti in 2016 as the strongest tropical cyclone in the eastern hemisphere by 1-minute sustained winds several others have recorded lower central pressure readings at 2004 utc on november 7, the eye of the cyclone made its first landfall in the philippines at guiuan eastern samar gradually weakening the storm made five additional landfalls in the country before emerging over the south china sea turning northwestward the typhoon eventually struck northern vietnam as a severe tropical storm on november 10. haiyan was last noted as a tropical depression by the jma the following day  the cyclone caused catastrophic destruction in the visayas particularly on samar and leyte according to un officials about 11 million people have been affected many have been left homeless.7  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  2.1

meteorological historyedit  main article meteorological history of typhoon haiyan  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  on november 2, the joint typhoon warning center began monitoring a broad low-pressure area about 425 kilometers miles east-southeast of pohnpei one of the states in the federated states of micronesianb 1 as the system moved through a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis,9 the japan meteorological agency classified it as a tropical depression early on november 3.10nb 2  the system quickly intensified into a tropical storm prompting the jma to assign it the name haiyan literally at 0000 utc on november 4.10 tracking generally westward along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge,12 rapid intensification ensued by november 5 as a central dense overcast with an embedded eye developing the jma classified haiyan as a typhoon later that day.10 on november 6, the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assigned the storm the local name yolanda as it approached their area of responsibility.13  intensification slowed somewhat during the day though the jtwc estimated the storm to have attained category 5-equivalent super typhoon status on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale around 1200 utcnb 315 later the eye of the typhoon passed over the island of kayangel in Palau.16  comparison between haiyan and katrina  around 1200 utc on november 7, haiyan attained ten-minute sustained winds of 230kmh and a minimum central pressure of 895 mbar 26.43 inHg.10 six hours later the jtwc estimated haiyan to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 315kmh and gusts up to 380kmh the storm displayed some characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone though a strong convective band remained present along the western side of the system.17  at 2040 utc on november 7, typhoon haiyan made landfall in guiuan eastern samar at peak intensity.18 the jtwcs unofficial estimate of one-minute sustained winds of 305kmh would by that measure make haiyan the most powerful storm ever recorded to strike land.19 interaction with land caused slight degradation of the storms structure though it remained an exceptionally powerful storm when it struck tolosa leyte around 2300 UTC.20 the typhoon made four additional landfalls as it traversed the Visayas21 daanbantayan bantayan island concepcion and busuanga island  haiyan with its core disrupted by interaction with the philippines emerged over the south china sea late on november 8.22 environmental conditions ahead of the storm soon became less favorable as cool stable air began wrapping into the western side of the circulation.23 continuing across the south china sea haiyan turned more northwesterly late on november 9 and through november 10 as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge previously steering it westward.24 rapid weakening ensued as haiyan approached its final landfall in Vietnam,25 ultimately striking the country near haiphong around 2100 utc as a severe tropical storm.10 once onshore the storm quickly diminished and was last noted as it dissipated over guangxi province china on november 11.10  preparationsedit  micronesia and palauedit  typhoon haiyan near palau on november 6  upon jtwcs declaration of tropical depression 31W on november 3, a tropical storm warning was issued for chuuk lagoon losap and poluwat in the federated states of micronesia further west faraulep satawal and woleai were placed under a typhoon watch

state and the islands of koror and kayangel in palau were placed under a typhoon watch.28 the government issued a mandatory evacuation for kayangel and although most residents ignored the warning they all survived the storm.16 as haiyan progressed westward the easternmost advisories were gradually discontinued.28 as haiyan intensified into a typhoon on november 5, warnings were raised across palau and yap State.2930 government offices in melekeok were used as an evacuation building for Palau.31 despite mandatory evacuation orders most residents on kayangel remained on the island and rode out the typhoon.32  philippinesedit  pagasa raised rainfall warning advisory in the central and eastern visayas during the passage of haiyan  shortly before typhoon haiyan entered the philippine area of responsibility on november 6, pagasa raised public storm warning signal No.1, the lowest of four levels for much of the visayas and Mindanao.33 as the storm continued to approach the country warnings expanded into luzon and increased in severity for eastern areas.34 by the evening of november 7, psws no 4, the highest level of warning which indicates winds in excess of 185kmh are expected was raised for biliran island eastern samar leyte northern cebu metro cebu samar and southern Leyte.3536 through november 8, the coverage of psws no 4 continued to expand with areas in southern luzon being included.37  psws map in the philippines during the passage of typhoon haiyan  officials placed police officers in the bicol region ahead of the storm.38 in the provinces of samar and leyte classes were canceled and residents in flood- and landslide-prone areas were required to evacuate.39 some of the storm-threatened areas were affected by an earlier earthquake in Bohol.40 then-philippine president noynoy aquino requested the military to deploy planes and helicopters to the region expected to be affected.41 as haiyan was moving very fast pagasa issued warnings at different levels to about 60 of the 80 provinces including the capital metro Manila.42 on november 8, the international charter on space and major disasters was activated providing widespread charitable satellite coverage to relief organizations.43  southern chinaedit  the state flood control and drought relief headquarters hoisted a level three emergency response in the provinces of

to safer waters away from the storm requests were sent to china malaysia indonesia and the philippines to aid any fishermen who needed immediate shelter from the typhoon.48 threatening vietnam after two other typhoons wutip and nari there were concerns that the storm would cause significant damage to homes with makeshift repairs.49 roughly 460,000 military personnel and other authorities were mobilized to assist in evacuation efforts.48 hundreds of flights were canceled across the country while schools were closed on november 11. on the small island of cn c all residents were moved to

catastrophic damage throughout much of the islands of leyte where cities and towns were largely destroyed.53 as of april 17, 2016, the national disaster risk reduction and management council confirmed 6,300 fatalities across the country 5,877 of those taking place in the eastern Visayas.3 the true death toll remains unclear being claimed to be at least 10,000 by some victims from tacloban city leyte as of november 13, 2015, the philippine red cross estimated that 22,000 people were missing  in surigao city 281.9mm of rainfall was recorded much of which fell in under 12 hours.54 storm surges were also recorded in many places in the island of leyte and samar pagasa measured 56 meter waves.55 in tacloban leyte the terminal building of tacloban airport was destroyed by a 5.2m storm surge up to the height of the second story.56 along the airport a storm surge of 4m was estimated.57 waves of 4.6m were also estimated.58 on the western coast of samar the storm surge was not as significant.59  haiyans first landfall was at guiuan in eastern samar where the typhoon touched down at 440am.6061 nearly all structures in the township suffered at least partial damage many of which were completely flattened.62 for several days following haiyans first landfall the damage situation in the fishing town remained unclear due to lack of communication in and out of the area.63 the damage could finally be assessed after philippine air force staff arrived in guiuan on november 10.64 prior to this a local priest was able to take his motorbike from guiuan to the towns of cabalogan and calbayog in samar armed with photos of the devastation shot on his mobile phone.65  there was widespread devastation from the storm surge in tacloban city especially in san jose with many buildings being destroyed trees knocked over or broken and cars piled up.58 the low-lying areas on the eastern side of tacloban city were hardest hit with some areas completely washed away flooding also extended for 1km inland on the east coast of the province.58 city administrator tecson john lim stated that roughly 90 percent of the city had been destroyed.53 journalists on the ground have described the devastation as the scale and apocalyptic.66 most families in samar and leyte lost some family members or relatives families came in from outlying provinces looking for relatives especially children who may have been washed away.67 the entire first floor of the tacloban city convention center which was serving as an evacuation shelter was submerged by storm surge many residents in the building were caught off-guard by the fast rising waters and subsequently drowned or were injured in the building.68  although wind speeds were extreme the major cause of damage and loss of life appears to have been storm surge the major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of samar and leyte with a particular focus on tacloban because of its location between samar and leyte and the large population in low-lying areas.59 philippine department of the interior and local government secretary mar roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris.69  sebastian rhodes stampa head of a un disaster assessment co-ordination team said there was on a massive scale in tacloban are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris the last time i saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the indian ocean tsunami.58 there is little communication in the city and no mobile phone coverage up the east coast of the leyte there are numerous towns and villages that are completely cut off without any assistance large parts of leyte and samar are without power and may have no power for a month.66  the storm crossed the visayas region for almost a day causing widespread flooding in cebu and bohol struck by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake two weeks before cities were also severely devastated.70 during the morning of november 8, media stations across the country were able to broadcast live the destruction of haiyan however before afternoon all communications on the visayas region failed the presidential communications department of president benigno aquino iii had difficulty contacting dilg secretary mar roxas and defense secretary voltaire gazmin in tacloban city to plan relief.71 widespread power interruptions landslides and flash floods were also reported major roads were blocked by trees and impassable 453 domestic and international airline flights were canceled some airports were also closed on november 8 and 9. ferries were affected relief and rescue efforts were underway by november 9, but some places remained isolated and out of communication due to severe damage.72  china and taiwanedit  typhoon haiyan reached hainan province where severe damage took place and six people were killed in various incidents.73 the hardest hit area was qionghai where roughly 3,500 people across 20 villages were isolated due to extensive flooding.74 direct economic losses in hainan amounted to 4.9 billion million.73 in guangxi province to the north heavy rains up to 380mm fell and wind gusts reached 100kmh an estimated 1.21 million people were affected of whom 26,300 were evacuated two people died while four others went missing after a car fell off a flooded road into a river near Beihai.76 losses throughout guangxi amounted to 275 million million.7375 approximately 900 homes and 25,500 hectares of crops were destroyed while 8,500 homes were damaged additionally an estimated 3 million people were affected by the storm throughout southern China.77 a cargo ship broke moorings at sanya on november 878 three members of the crew drowned while four others went missing.75 one person also went missing off the coast of lantau island hong Kong.79  along the coast of new taipei 16 people were swept out to sea by three 8m waves after several hours of search and rescue eight were hospitalized while the other eight drowned this was considered the largest loss of life from waves in taiwan in several years.80  vietnamedit  haiyan made landfall as a severe tropical storm in qung ninh province on november 10 and produced high winds and widespread heavy rainfall which affected northern Vietnam.81 rainfall totals of up to 461mm and wind gusts of up to 147kmh were recorded.81 ten people were killed while they were preparing for haiyans landfall while no one was killed after the system made landfall however 4 people are missing in qung ninh Province.81  aftermathedit  due to extensive damage and high death toll pagasa announced that the name yolanda would be stricken off the typhoon naming lists.8283 pagasa chose the name yasmin to replace yolanda for the 2017 season during their 2014 annual session the escapwmo typhoon committee announced that the name haiyan would also be retired from its naming lists on january 1, 2015, and was therefore replaced by the name Bailu.84  philippinesedit  animated satellite comparison of power outages across the visayas following typhoon haiyan  map of damaged houses by

typhoon passed over the town  by november 11, the provinces of aklan capiz cebu iloilo leyte palawan and samar were placed under a state of national calamity allowing the government to use state funds for relief and rehabilitation and to control prices of basic goods.85 additionally approximately 30.6 million had been allocated in relief assistance by the ndrrmc local and national agencies deployed a collective 18,177 personnel 844 vehicles 44 seagoing vessels and 31 aircraft for various operations.3 cbcp also declared 8 days of mourning for victims of the typhoon on the same date.86  world health organization representative in the philippines dr julie hall noted that while many survivors requiring medical attention in the first week suffer from trauma and fractures the concern shifts toward chronic conditions as the weeks pass the who coordinated the massive international response to help the philippine government meet the acute need for healthcare services in the affected areas.87  extreme damage to infrastructure throughout the region posed logistical problems that greatly slowed relief efforts though aid was flown into local airports most of it remained there as roads remained closed.88 according to estimates on november 13, only 20 percent of the affected population in tacloban city was receiving aid with lack of access to clean water some residents dug up water pipes and boiled water from there in order to survive thousands of people sought to evacuate the city via C-130 cargo planes however the slow process fueled further aggravation reports of escaped prisoners raping women in the city prompted a further urgency to evacuate one resident was quoted as saying is a dead city.53 due to the lack of electricity planes could only operate during the daylight further slowing the evacuations at dawn on november 12, thousands of people broke through fences and rushed planes only to be forced back by police and military personnel a similar incident occurred later that day as a us cargo plane was landing.89  on november 14, a correspondent from the bbc reported tacloban to be a zone although the situation soon stabilized when the presence of government law enforcement was increased safety concerns prompted several relief agencies to back out of the operation and some united nations staff were pulled out for safety reasons a message circulating among the agencies urged them to not go into tacloban for this reason.90 on the west coast of leyte island residents in ormoc were fearing that the focus on tacloban city would leave them without aid though not as hard hit roughly 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed and supplies were running low hospitals in the city were either shut down or working at partial capacity leaving many of the nearly 2,000 injured in the city without medical assistance in nearby baybay lack of assistance fueled anger and incited looting for survival.91  in the coastal community guiuan which took the full brunt of the typhoon mayor christopher gonzalez is credited with saving countless lives after he incessantly urged residents to evacuate he referred to the storm as which roughly translates to armageddon of the towns 45,000 residents 87 died 931 were injured and 23 others were listed as missing us navy capt russell hays a medical officer estimated that a storm of haiyans caliber could have killed as many as 4,500 in guiuan alone had it not been for the mayors efforts.92  on november 18, the government of the philippines launched an online portal called the foreign aid transparency hub that provides the public a transparency view of the funds and other aids received by the government from the international community.9394  to lead the management and rehabilitation efforts of the central provinces in the philippines affected by typhoon haiyan philippines president benigno aquino iii appointed panfilo lacson as typhoon haiyan rehabilation Czar.95

government is planning to replant mangroves in coastal areas while preserving the remaining ones.100 affected residents were allowed to return to their homes by the department of health on december 7, 2013 after an air quality test found out that benzene levels in affected areas reached near-zero parts per million earlier residents were asked to evacuate affected areas as the benzene levels had reached unhealthy amounts.101  looting and violenceedit  the remains of a home destroyed by the storm in tacloban city  throughout tacloban city widespread looting took place in the days following haiyans passage in some instances relief trucks were attacked and had food stolen in the city two of the citys malls and numerous grocery stores were subjected to looting a fuel depot in the city was guarded by armed police while 200 additional officers were dispatched to assist.102 security checkpoints had since been set up all over tacloban and a curfew was imposed on residents to prevent more attacks.103 philippine military forces also prevented members of the new peoples army from ambushing a relief convoy bound for samar in matnog sorsogon killing two.104 president benigno aquino iii considered declaring martial law in hopes of restoring order in affected areas.105106  looting intensified as slow recovery efforts forced residents to seek any means necessary to survive tacloban city administrator tecson john lim stated looting is not criminality it is self-preservation the chicago tribune reported that some areas were on the brink of anarchy though interior secretary mar roxas denied such claims.53 further complicating efforts to retain order was the lack of officers reporting for work in tacloban only 100 of the citys 1,300 police personnel reported for duty.89 in alangalang just west of tacloban eight people were crushed to death after the walls of a warehouse collapsed during a raid on a government rice stockpile approximately 33,000 bags of rice each weighing 50kg were stolen warehouses were also raided in jaro and palo throughout the city of tacloban itself people began looting from homes as stores had been completely emptied.53  criticism of government responseedit  color coded map of eastern visayas showing the number of deaths caused by typhoon haiyan  more than 1,000  500-999  100-499  50-99  25-49  1-24  0  condemnations of slow government action in the relief effort in response to the typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed media reports criticized the aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation.107108 up until november 12, five days after the typhoon struck survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food water and shelter while remote towns in leyte and samar were yet to be reached by aid.109 the philippine government responded by saying that they have dealt with the tragedy well but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees who were usually the first to respond in these events were victims of the typhoon themselves.110 cabinet secretary jose rene almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors.111 the national government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the bureau of fire instead to the department of health dr racquel fortun one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of DOH.112  one of the biggest controversies of typhoon haiyan is probably the number of the victims or the body count according to the philippine government sources the number of those killed during the typhoon ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 individuals while some sources claim that the body count reaches up to 15,000.113114115  humanitarian crisis and population displacementedit  the philippines faced a humanitarian crisis days after the

contributions of china and the united states were given focus with regards to their involvement in the politics of the Philippines.257 apart from having the two largest economies in the world both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country china is currently disputing the spratly islands in the south china sea with the philippines while the united states used to be an occupying power and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islands.258  china was initially criticized for its meager contribution of us cash each from the government and the chinese red cross to the typhoon victims which led to commentary about its disputes with the Philippines.259 earlier in 2013, the philippines sued china over the nine-dotted line commentators attribute this low amount to chinas intentions to isolate the philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of southeast Asia.260 the move had mixed reactions from the public of china with some commending its decision while others such as the global times insisted that china should be a responsible power china later increased its contributions by US1.64 million in supplies and sent its naval hospital ship

sao the lead negotiator of the philippines delegation received a standing ovation at the conference when he declared a hunger strike  in solidarity with my countrymen who are struggling to find food

hunger strike.268  the correlation between the increasing intensity of storms and the progression of climate change was discussed by climate scientists hurricanes and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from the warmth of the sea we know sea-surface temperatures are warming pretty much around the planet so thats a pretty direct influence of climate change on the nature of the storm said will steffen director of the australian national university climate change institute.269 myles allen head of the climate dynamics group at the university of oxford said that current consensus is that climate change is not making the risk of hurricanes any greater but there are physical arguments and evidence that there is a risk of more intense hurricanes.269 the huffington post made the point that the 70 deforestation of the philippines since 1900, as reported by the national forest management bureau made far more lethal flooding from cyclones like haiyan more likely.270 the ipcc fifth assessment report had stated in september of the same year that series of cyclone indices such as power dissipation an aggregate compound of tropical cyclone frequency duration and intensity that measures total wind energy by tropical cyclones show upward trends in the north atlantic and weaker upward trends in the western north pacific since the late 1970s.269  in popular mediaedit  a
