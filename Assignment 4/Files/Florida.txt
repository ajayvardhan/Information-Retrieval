southeastern coast  european arrival  main article spanish florida  map of florida likely based on the expeditions of hernando de soto  st augustine is one of oldest cities in florida established in 1565. the spanish-floridan color scheme of red and white is repeated throughout downtown  the castillo de san marcos originally white with red corners its design reflects the colors and shapes of the cross of burgundy and the subsequent flag of florida  grenadiers led by bernardo de glvez at the siege of pensacola augusto ferrer-dalmau 2015.  florida was the first part of the continental united states to be visited and settled by europeans the earliest known european explorers came with the spanish conquistador juan ponce de len ponce de len spotted and landed on the peninsula on april 2, 1513. he named the region la florida of flowers.12 the story that he was searching for the fountain of youth is mythical and only appeared long after his death.13  in may 1539, conquistador hernando de soto skirted the coast of florida searching for a deep harbor to land he described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile some reaching as high as 70 feet with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult.14 the spanish introduced christianity cattle horses sheep the castilian language and more to Florida.15full citation needed spain established several settlements in florida with varying degrees of success in 1559, don tristn de luna y arellano established a settlement at present-day pensacola making it the first attempted settlement in florida but it was mostly abandoned by 1561.  in 1565, the settlement of st augustine agustn was established under the leadership of admiral and governor pedro menndez de avils creating what would become the oldest european settlement in the continental us and establishing the first generation of floridanos and the government of Florida.16 spain maintained tenuous control over the region by converting the local tribes to christianity  the geographical area of florida diminished with the establishment of english settlements to the north and french claims to the west the english attacked st augustine burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times spain built the castillo de san marcos in 1672 and fort matanzas in 1742 to defend floridas capital city from attacks and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the captaincy general of cuba and the spanish west indies  florida attracted numerous africans and african-americans from adjacent british colonies who sought freedom from slavery in 1738, governor manuel de montiano established fort gracia real de santa teresa de mose near st augustine a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the florida militia and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in north America.1718  in 1763, spain traded florida to the kingdom of great britain for control of havana cuba which had been captured by the british during the seven years war it was part of a large expansion of british territory following their victory in the seven years war a large portion of the floridano population left taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba.19 the british soon constructed the kings road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british named ford both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.202122  the british divided and consolidated the florida provinces floridas into east florida and west florida a division the spanish government kept after the brief british period.23 the british government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the french and indian war in order to encourage settlement in order to induce settlers to move to florida reports of its natural wealth were published in england a large number of british settlers who were described as being and of good character moved to florida mostly coming from south carolina georgia and england there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of bermuda this would be the first permanent english-speaking population in what is now duval county baker county st johns county and nassau county the british built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber.2425  as a result of these initiatives northeastern florida prospered economically in a way it never did under spanish administration furthermore the british governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the floridas and in the meantime they were with the advice of councils to establish courts this would be the first introduction of much of the english-derived legal system which florida still has today including trial by jury habeas corpus and county-based government.2425 neither east florida nor west florida would send any representatives to philadelphia to draft the declaration of independence florida would remain a loyalist stronghold for the duration of the american Revolution.26  spain regained both east and west florida after britains defeat in the american revolution and the subsequent treaty of versailles in 1783, and continued the provincial divisions until 1821.  joining the united states indian removal  see also republic of east florida florida territory and seminole wars  defense of floridas northern border with the united states was minor during the second spanish period the region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for indian attacks against us territories and the us pressed spain for reform  americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities and the floridan government they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to immigrate into florida unchecked these migrants mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period would be the progenitors of the population known as florida Crackers.27  these american settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored spanish authorities the british settlers who had remained also resented spanish rule leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called free and independent republic of west florida on september 23. after meetings beginning in june rebels overcame the garrison at baton rouge in louisiana and unfurled the flag of the new republic a single white star on a blue field this flag would later become known as the blue flag  in 1810, parts of west florida were annexed by proclamation of president james madison who claimed the region as part of the louisiana purchase these parts were incorporated into the newly formed territory of orleans the us annexed the mobile district of west florida to the mississippi territory in 1812. spain continued to dispute the area though the united states gradually increased the area it occupied in 1812, a group of settlers from georgia with de facto support from the us federal government attempted to overthrow the floridan government in the province of east florida the settlers hoped to convince floridans to join their cause and proclaim independence from spain but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813.28  seminoles based in east florida began raiding georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves the united states army led increasingly frequent incursions into spanish territory including the 18171818 campaign against the seminole indians by andrew jackson that became known as the first seminole war the united states now effectively controlled east florida control was necessary according to secretary of state john quincy adams because florida had become derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy civilized or savage of the united states and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.29  florida had become a burden to spain which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the united states through the adams-ons treaty which took effect in 1821.30 president james monroe was authorized on march 3, 1821 to take possession of east florida and west florida for the united states and provide for initial governance.31 andrew jackson on behalf of the us federal government served as a military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly acquired territory for a brief period.32 on march 30, 1822, the us congress merged east florida and part of west florida into the florida Territory.33  a contemporaneous depiction of the new river massacre in 1836.  by the early 1800s, indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern us and also in florida in 1830, the us congress passed the indian removal act and as settlement increased pressure grew on the united states government to remove the indians from florida seminoles harbored runaway blacks known as the black seminoles and clashes between whites and indians grew with the influx of new settlers in 1832, the treaty of paynes landing promised to the seminoles lands west of the mississippi river if they agreed to leave florida many seminole left at this time  some seminoles remained and the us army arrived in florida leading to the second seminole war following the war approximately 3,000 seminole and 800 black seminole were removed to indian territory a few hundred seminole remained in florida in the everglades  a cracker cowboy 19th century  on march 3, 1845, florida became the 27th state to join the united states of America.34 the state was admitted as a slave state and ceased to be a sanctuary for runaway slaves initially its population grew slowly  as european settlers continued to encroach on seminole lands and the united states intervened to move the remaining seminoles to the west the third seminole war resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining seminoles although hundreds of seminole indians remained in the Everglades.35  slavery war and disenfranchisement  further information florida in the american civil war  the battle of olustee during the american civil war 1864.  american settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north florida which required numerous laborers which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market by 1860, florida had only 140,424 people of whom 44 were enslaved there were fewer than 1,000 free african americans before the american civil War.36  in january 1861, nearly all delegates in the florida legislature approved an ordinance of secession declaring florida to be sovereign and independent nationan apparent reassertion to the preamble in floridas constitution of 1838, in which florida agreed with congress to be a and independent state although not directly related to the issue of slavery the ordinance declared floridas secession from the union allowing it to become one of the founding members of the confederate states a looser union of states  the confederal union received little help from florida the 15,000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere the largest engagements in the state were the battle of olustee on february 20, 1864, and the battle of natural bridge on march 6, 1865. both were confederate victories.37 the war ended in 1865.  following the american civil war floridas congressional representation was restored on june 25, 1868, albeit forcefully after radical reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders after the reconstruction period ended in 1876, white democrats regained power in the state legislature in 1885 they created a new constitution followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whitescitation needed  until the mid-20th century florida was the least populous southern state in 1900, its population was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44 were african american the same proportion as before the civil War.38 the boll weevil devastated cotton crops  forty thousand blacks roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population left the state in the great migration they left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities.39 disfranchisement for most african americans in the state persisted until the civil rights movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage  20th-century growth  historically floridas economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as cattle sugar cane citrus fruits tomatoes and strawberries  economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to florida and related development of hotels and resort communities combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the florida land boom of the 1920s, which brought a brief period of intense land development devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928, followed by the great depression brought that period to a halt floridas economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for world war ii  in 1939, florida was described as still very largely an empty State.40 subsequently the growing availability of air conditioning the climate and a low cost of living made the state a haven migration from the rust belt and the northeast sharply increased floridas population after 1945. in recent decades more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy  with a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census florida is the most populous state in the southeastern united states and the fourth-most populous in the
