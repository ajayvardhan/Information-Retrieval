on runion island issues warnings on tropical cyclones within the basin which is defined as the waters of the indian ocean from the coast of africa to 90E, south of the equator the agency issues the warnings as part of its role as a regional specialized meteorological center designated as such in 1993 by the world meteorological organization intensities are estimated through the dvorak technique which utilizes images from satellites by the american national oceanic and atmospheric Administration.12  the joint typhoon warning center a joint united states navy united states air force task force also issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region.3 wind estimates from mto-france and most other basins throughout the world are sustained over 10minutes, while estimates from the united states-based joint typhoon warning center are sustained over 1minute. 1-minute winds are about 1.12 times the amount of 10-minute winds.4  if a tropical storm in the basin strengthens to attain 10minute sustained winds of at least 118kmh the mfr classifies it as a tropical cyclone equivalent to a hurricane or typhoon use of cyclone which is more restrictive than the usual definition.5  history of the basinedit  the first storm in the database for mfr originated on January11, 1848. in January1960, the first named storm was alex and each subsequent year had a list of storm names beginning in 1967, satellites helped locate cyclones in the basin and in the following year the mfr began estimating storm intensities from the satellite images by 1977, the agency was using the dvorak technique on an unofficial basis but officially adopted it in 1981. originally the basin only extended to 80E, and while it was extended eastward to the current 90E, a lack of satellite imagery initially made data uncertain east of 80E. the world meteorological organization designated the mfr as a regional tropical cyclones advisory centre in 1988, and upgraded it to a regional specialized meteorological center in 1993. in may 1998, two europe-based meteosat satellites began providing complete coverage of the basin on July1, 2002, the mfr shifted the cyclone year to begin on this date and end on June30 of the following year previously the cyclone year began on August1 and ended on the subsequent July31. in 2003, the mfr extended their area of warning responsibility to 40S, having previously been limited at 30S.2 during 2011, mfr started a reanalysis project of all tropical systems between 197898, with methods such as a dvorak technique reanalysis and use of microwave imagery.6 preliminary results from this reanalysis project include correcting an increasing trend in the number of very intense tropical cyclones in the basin since 1978.6 this also revealed a seemingly systematic underestimation of tropical cyclone intensities in the past.6  statisticsedit  from the 198081 to the 201011 season there was an average of 9.3tropical storms each year in the basin a tropical storm has 10minute winds of at least 65kmh there are an average of five storms that become tropical cyclones which have 10 minute winds of at least 120kmh as of 2002, there was an average of 54days when tropical systems were active in the basin of which 20 had tropical cyclones active or a system with winds of over 120kmh the median start date for the season was November17, and the median end date was April20.1  climatologyedit  tracks of storms in the basin from 1980 to 2005  generally the monsoon does not cross into the mozambique channel until december as a result storms rarely form there before that time.1 from 1948 to 2010, 94tropical systems developed in the small body of water of which about half made landfall.8 occasionally small storms form in the mozambique channel that resemble mediterranean tropical cyclones or storms in the northeastern atlantic ocean these systems are well-organized but have weaker convection than typical tropical cyclones and originate over cooler than normal water temperatures of less than 26C a survey in 2004 conducted by weather expert gary padgett found meteorologists split whether these storms should be classified as tropical or subtropical.9  in an average year ten tropical depressions or storms strike madagascar and most generally do not cause much damage.10 occasionally storms or their remnants enter the interior of southeastern africa bringing heavy rainfall to Zimbabwe.11  seasonsedit  list of south-west indian ocean cyclones before 1963  196263 south-west indian ocean cyclone season  196364 south-west indian
