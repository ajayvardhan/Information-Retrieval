orbital decay  orbit redirects here for the 2007 film see decaying orbit  in orbital mechanics decay is a process that leads to gradual decrease of the distance between two orbiting bodies at their closest approach periapsis over many orbital periods these orbiting bodies can be a planet and its satellite a star and any object orbiting it or components of any binary system orbits do not decay without some friction-like mechanism which robs energy from the orbital motion this can be any of a number of mechanical gravitational or electromagnetic effects for bodies in a low earth orbit the most significant effect is the atmospheric drag  if left unchecked the decay eventually results in termination of the orbit when the smaller object strikes the surface of the primary or for objects where the primary has an atmosphere the smaller object burns explodes or otherwise breaks up in the larger objects atmosphere or for objects where the primary is a star ends with incineration by the stars radiation as for comets and so on  collisions and mergers of two stellar-mass objects usually produce cataclysmic effectsnot verified in body see stellar collision and gamma-ray burst  due to atmospheric drag the lowest altitude above the earth at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately 150km  contents  1 causes  1.1

information atmospheric drag  atmospheric drag at orbital altitude is caused by frequent collisions of gas molecules with the satellite it is the major cause of orbital decay for satellites in low earth orbit it results in the reduction in the altitude of a satellites orbit for the case of earth atmospheric drag resulting in satellite re-entry can be described by the following sequence  lower altitude denser atmosphere increased drag increased heat usually burns on re-entry  orbital decay thus involves a positive feedback effect where the more the orbit decays the lower its altitude drops and the lower the altitude the faster the decay decay is also particularly sensitive to external factors of the space environment such as solar activity which are not very predictable during solar maxima the earths atmosphere causes significant drag up to a hundred kilometers higher than during solar minimacitation needed  atmospheric drag exerts a significant effect at the altitudes of space stations space shuttles and other manned earth-orbit spacecraft and satellites with relatively high earth orbits such as the hubble space telescope space stations typically require a regular altitude boost to counteract orbital decay also orbital station-keeping uncontrolled orbital decay brought down the skylab space station and controlled orbital decay was used to de-orbit the mir space stationcitation needed  regular orbital boosts are also needed by the hubble space telescope though on a longer time scale due to its much higher altitude however orbital decay is also a limiting factor to the length of time the hubble can go without a maintenance rendezvous the most recent performed successfully by STS-125, with space shuttle atlantis launching may 11, 2009, though newer telescopes are in much higher orbits or in some cases in solar orbit so orbital boosting may not be needed.1  tidal effectsedit  this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section

by tidal effects when the orbiting body is large enough to raise a significant tidal bulgeclarification needed on the body it is orbiting and is either in a retrograde orbit or is below the synchronous orbit the resulting tidal interaction saps momentum from the orbiting body and transfers it to the primarys rotation lowering the orbits altitude until frictional effects come into play  examples of satellites undergoing tidal orbital decay are mars moon phobos neptunes moon triton and the extrasolar planet TrES-3b.  light and thermal radiationedit  main articles poyntingrobertson effect and yarkovsky effect  small objects in the solar system also experience an orbital decay due to the forces applied by asymmetric radiation pressure ideally energy absorbed would equal blackbody energy emitted at any given point resulting in no net force however the yarkovsky effect is the phenomenon that because absorption and radiation of heat are not instantaneous objects which are not terminally locked absorb sunlight energy on surfaces exposed to the sun but those surfaces do not re-emit much of that energy until after the object has rotated so that the emission is parallel to the objects orbit this results in a very small acceleration parallel to the orbital path yet one which can be significant for small objects over millions of years the poynting-robertson effect is a force opposing the objects velocity caused by asymmetric incidence of light ie aberration of light for an object with prograde rotation these two effects will apply opposing but generally unequal forces  gravitational radiationedit  main article two-body problem in general relativity  gravitational radiation is another mechanism of orbital decay it is negligible for orbits of planets and planetary satellites but is noticeable for systems of compact objects as seen in observations of neutron star orbits  stellar collisionedit  further information stellar collision  the coming together of two binary stars when they lose energy and approach each other several things can cause the loss of energy including tidal forces mass transfer and gravitational radiation the stars describe the path of a spiral as they approach each other this sometimes results in a merger of the two stars or the creation of a black hole the last several revolutions of the stars around each other take only a few seconds in the latter case.2  mass concentrationedit  further information mass concentration  while not a direct cause of orbital decay uneven mass distributions as mascons of the body being orbited can perturb orbits over time and extreme distributions can cause orbits to be highly unstable the resulting unstable orbit can mutate into an orbit where one of the direct causes of orbital decay can take place  referencesedit  the hubble program servicing missions SM4  gravitational waves ligo retrieved 1 may 2015.  orbital decay calculations with discussion and examples  physics portal
