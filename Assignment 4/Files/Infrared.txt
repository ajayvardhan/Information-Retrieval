corresponding to 3.4, 4.6, and 12m wavelengths respectively  infrared radiation or simply infrared or ir is electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths than those of visible light and is therefore invisible although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light it extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometre 430THz, to 1 micrometres specially pulsed lasers can allow humans to detect ir radiation up to 1050 nm.2345. most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared like all emr ir carries radiant energy and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle the photon  infrared was discovered in 1800 by astronomer sir william herschel who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light by means of its effect on a thermometer.6 slightly more than half of the total energy from the sun was eventually found to arrive on earth in the form of infrared the balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on earths climate  infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements it excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.7  infrared radiation is used in industrial scientific and medical applications night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds detect objects such as planets and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe.8 infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems to observe changing blood flow in the skin and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus  thermal-infrared imaging is used extensively for military and civilian purposes military applications include target acquisition surveillance night vision homing and tracking humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10m non-military uses include thermal

natural infrarededit  sunlight at an effective temperature of 5,780 kelvins is composed of near thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared at zenith sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1kilowatt per square meter at sea level of this energy 527 watts is infrared radiation 445 watts is visible light and 32 watts is ultraviolet radiation.10 nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared shorter than 4 micrometers  on the surface of earth at far lower temperatures than the surface of the sun almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared region much longer than in sunlight of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy  regions within the infrarededit  in general objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object in accordance with wiens displacement law  therefore the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections  commonly used sub-division schemeedit  a

wavelengths l m n and q refer to the mid-infrared region these letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric windows and appear for instance in the titles of many papers  sensor response

or 7 to 14m is the atmospheric window covered by hgcdte and microbolometers  very-long wave infrared to about 30m, covered by doped silicon  near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum other definitions follow different physical mechanisms peaks vs bands water absorption and the newest follow technical reasons common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050nm, while ingaass sensitivity starts around 950nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600nm, depending on the specific configuration no international standards for these specifications are currently available  the onset of infrared is defined to different standards at various values typically between 700nm and 800nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined the human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700nm wavelength so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources however particularly intense near-ir light from ir lasers ir led sources or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels can be detected up to approximately 780nm, and will be perceived as red light intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050nm can be seen as a dull red glow causing some difficulty in near-ir illumination of scenes in the dark this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination leaves are particularly bright in the near ir and if all visible light leaks from around an ir-filter are blocked and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque ir-passing photographic filter it is possible to see the wood effect that consists of ir-glowing foliage.18  telecommunication bands in the infrarededit  in optical communications the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands

appear to be hotter in this thermal image the ceramic cylinder appears to be hotter than its cubic container of silicon carbide while in fact they have the same temperature  infrared radiation is popularly known as radiationcitation needed but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them infrared light from the sun accounts for 4920 of the heating of earth with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25m band but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects black body and wiens displacement law.21  heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared extending into visible ultraviolet and even x-ray regions the solar corona thus the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical low temperatures often found near the surface of planet earth  the concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body to further explain two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity for example for any pre-set emissivity value objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler for that reason incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers  applicationsedit  this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations

camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the human eye despite a dark back-lit scene active-infrared night vision delivers identifying details as seen on the display monitor  infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see.22 night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light.22 infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source.22  the use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment.23  thermographyedit  thermography helped to determine the temperature profile of the space shuttle thermal protection system during re-entry  main article thermography  infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects the emissivity is known this is termed thermography or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed pyrometry thermography imaging is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs  thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum 90014,000 nanometers or 0.914m and produce images of that radiation since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures according to the black body radiation law thermography makes it possible to ones environment with or without visible illumination the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature the name  hyperspectral imagingedit  main article hyperspectral imaging  hyperspectral thermal infrared emission measurement an outdoor scan in winter conditions ambient temperature 15C, image produced with a specim lwir hyperspectral imager relative radiance spectra from various targets in the image are shown with arrows the infrared spectra of the different objects such as the watch clasp have clearly distinctive characteristics the contrast level indicates the temperature of the object.24  infrared light from the led of a remote control as recorded by a digital camera  a hyperspectral image is a containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with nir swir mwir and lwir spectral regions typical applications include biological mineralogical defence and industrial measurements  thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a thermographic camera with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full lwir spectrum consequently chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements outdoor surveillance and uav applications.25  other imagingedit  in infrared photography infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum digital cameras often use infrared blockers cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can intense near-infrared appearing as a bright purple-white color this is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near ir-bright areas as near a lamp where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image there is also a technique called imaging which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques recently t-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy  reflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changes  trackingedit  main article infrared homing  infrared tracking also known as infrared homing refers to a passive missile guidance system which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as since infrared is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies many objects such as people vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat and as such are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.26  heatingedit  main article infrared heating  this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced

heat the occupants it may also be used in other heating applications such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque absorbent objects rather than the air around them  infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes eg curing of coatings forming of plastics annealing plastic welding and print drying in these applications infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating  efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material  coolingedit  main article radiative cooling  a variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems the lwir m region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere  communicationsedit  ir data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants these devices usually conform to standards published by irda the infrared data association remote controls and irda devices use infrared light-emitting diodes to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam the beam is modulated ie switched on and off to prevent interference from other sources of infrared sunlight or artificial lighting the receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances infrared remote control protocols like RC-5, sirc are used to communicate with infrared  free space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabits compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable except for the radiation damage the eye cannot detect ir blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.28  infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330nm dispersion or 1,550nm transmission are the best choices for standard silica fibers  ir data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the rias infrared audible signage project transmitting ir data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beaming  spectroscopyedit  infrared vibrational spectroscopy also near-infrared spectroscopy is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond a group of atoms in a molecule CH2 may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole if an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency the vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light typically the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000400cm1, the mid-infrared a spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded this can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity example a wet sample will show a broad o-h absorption around 3200cm1.  thin film metrologyedit  in the semiconductor industry infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient can be determined via the forouhi-bloomer dispersion equations the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension depth and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures  meteorologyedit  ir satellite picture taken 1315 z on 15th october 2006. a frontal system can be seen in the gulf of mexico with embedded cumulonimbus cloud shallower cumulus and stratocumulus can be seen off the eastern seaboard  weather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types to calculate land and surface water temperatures and to locate ocean surface features the scanning is typically in the range 10.312.5m and IR5 channels  high cold ice clouds such as cirrus or cumulonimbus show up bright white lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black one disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up however using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel and the near-infrared channel low cloud can be distinguished producing a fog satellite picture the main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied  these infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the gulf stream which are valuable to the shipping industry fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea even el nio phenomena can be spotted using color-digitized techniques the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information  the main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08m can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere  climatologyedit  in the field of climatology atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere these trends provide information on long-term changes in earths climate it is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming together with solar radiation  schematic of the greenhouse effect  a pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements this is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5m and 50m.  astronomyedit  main articles infrared astronomy and far-infrared astronomy  beta pictoris with its planet beta pictoris b the light-blue dot off-center as seen in infrared it combines two images the inner disc is at 3.6m.  astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components including mirrors lenses and solid state digital detectors for this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy to form an image the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources and the detectors are chilled using liquid helium  the sensitivity of earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows this limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy  the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers cold dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected the visible light spectrum the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet  infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies which are often cloaked in gas and dust distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths so they are more readily observed in the infrared.8  infrared cleaningedit  infrared cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan it works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels green and blue the infrared channel in combination with the other channels is used to detect the location of scratches and dust once located those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.29  art conservation and analysisedit  the arnolfini portrait by jan van eyck national gallery london  infrared reflectographyfr it es as called by art conservators,30 can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide this often reveals the artists use of carbon black which shows up well in reflectograms as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist this is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work in general the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version it also gives useful insights into working practices.31  among many other changes in the arnolfini portrait of 1434 the mans face was originally higher by about the height of his eye the womans was higher and her eyes looked more to the front each of his feet was underdrawn in one position painted in another and then overpainted in a third these alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms.32  recent progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings which were later overpainted by the artist.33 notable examples are picassos ironing and room where in both cases a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known today  similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects especially very old written documents such as the dead sea scrolls the roman works in the villa of the papyri and the silk
