 atlantic hurricane seasons  1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935  the 1933 atlantic hurricane season was the second most active atlantic hurricane season on record with 20storms forming in the northwest atlantic ocean breaking the record set by 1887. the season ran through the summer and the first half of fall in 1933, with activity as early as may and as late as november a tropical cyclone was active for all but 13days from june 28 to october 7. the year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season which broke the record with 28storms. tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24tropical cyclones.1  of the 20storms during the season 11 attained hurricane status six of those were major hurricanes with sustained winds of over 111mph two of the hurricanes reached winds of 160mph which is a category 5the highest of 5 on the modern saffir-simpson hurricane scalenb 1 the season produced several deadly storms with eight storms killing more than 20people. all but 3 of the 20known storms affected land at some point during their durations  contents  1 season summary  2 systems  2.1 tropical storm one  2.2 hurricane two  2.3 tropical storm three

record-holder of 19storms in 1887. fifteen of the seasons storms made landfall as tropical cyclones and another struck land as an extratropical storm eight tropical storms including six hurricanes hit the united states during the season including the chesapeakepotomac hurricane which the us weather bureau described as one of the most severe in history along the mid-atlantic states seven tropical storms including four hurricanes hit mexico two of which caused severe damage in the tampico area.4  the season was continuously active with six storms forming during the month of august alone.5 at the time many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season most of the records were broken in later years.6 during the season the us weather bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms including coastal portions of texas as well as from florida to massachusetts forcing the evacuations of thousands of people the deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck tampico mexico killing over 184residents. the costliest hurricane was the chesapeakepotomac hurricane which caused in damage from north carolina to new jerseynb 2 the hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in Maryland.4  in addition to the 20tropical storms there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity the first developed on June1 in the northwest caribbean and dissipated a few days later another depression developed on July11 over panama and also quickly dissipated a tropical depression developed on July17 in the northeastern atlantic west of the azores and one ship reported hurricane-force winds however there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized so it was not classified as a tropical storm originally there was a tropical storm in the database in the caribbean in the middle of august but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds similarly there was a tropical storm in the database in late september but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds.5  the season produced the highest accumulated cyclone energy on record with a total of 259. the measurement is a method to compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons originally 1933 had an ace of 213,7 which was surpassed by 1950 and 2005.8 however the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found that the storms in 1933 were stronger than initially reported.7  systemsedit  tropical storm
