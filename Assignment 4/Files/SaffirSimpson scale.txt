wind scale formerly the saffirsimpson hurricane scale classifies hurricanes western hemisphere tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds to be classified as a hurricane a tropical cyclone must have maximum sustained winds of at least 74mph 64kn 119kmh 1. the highest classification in the scale Category5, consists of storms with sustained winds exceeding 156mph 136kn 251kmh.  the classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding a hurricane will cause upon landfall  officially the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale is used only to describe hurricanes forming in the atlantic ocean and northern pacific ocean east of the international date line other areas use different scales to label these storms which are called or depending on the area  there is some criticism of the sshs for not taking rain storm surge and other important factors into consideration but sshs defenders say that part of the goal of sshs is to be straightforward and simple to understand  contents  1 history  2 categories  2.1 category 1  2.2

saffir and meteorologist robert simpson who at the time was director of the us national hurricane center the scale was introduced to the general public in 1973,2 and saw widespread use after neil frank replaced simpson at the helm of the nhc in 1974.3  the initial scale was developed by saffir a structural engineer who in 1969 went on commission for the united nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas.4 while performing the study saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane mirroring the utility of the richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes he devised a 15 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures saffir gave the scale to the nhc and simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding  in 2009, the nhc made moves to eliminate pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories transforming it into a pure wind scale called the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale the new scale became operational on may 15, 2010.6 the scale excludes flood ranges storm surge estimations rainfall and location which means a Category2 hurricane which hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a Category5 hurricane that hits a rural area.7 the agency cited various hurricanes as reasons for removing the inaccurate information including hurricane katrina and hurricane ike which both had stronger than estimated storm surges and hurricane charley which had weaker than estimated storm surge.8 since removed from the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale storm surge predicting and modeling is now handled with the use of a computerized numerical model developed by the national weather service called lake and overland surge from hurricanes  in 2012, the nhc expanded the windspeed range for category 4 by 1mph in both directions to 130156mph, with corresponding changes in the other units kn 209251kmh, instead of 131155mph kn 210249kmh. the nhc and the central pacific hurricane center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments and then convert to mph and kmh with a similar rounding for other reports so an intensity of 115 knots is rated category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour would round down to 130mph, making it appear to be a category 3 storm likewise an intensity of 135 knots and thus category 4 is 250.02kmh, which according to the definition used before the change would be category 5. to resolve these issues the nhc had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245kmh. the change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250kmh, and still qualify as category 4. since the nhc had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in category 4 in each unit of measure the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years.5 the new scale became operational on may 15, 2012.9  categoriesedit  the scale separates hurricanes into five different categories based on wind the us national hurricane center classifies hurricanes of Category3 and above as major hurricanes and the joint typhoon warning center classifies typhoons of 150mph or greater category 4 and category 5 as super typhoons all tropical cyclones can be very dangerous most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization which specifies measuring winds at a height of 33ft for 10minutes, and then taking the average by contrast the us national weather service central pacific hurricane center and the joint typhoon warning center define sustained winds as average winds over a period of one minute measured at the same 33ft height,1011 and that is the definition used for this scale intensity of example hurricanes is from both the time of landfall and the maximum intensity  the scale is roughly logarithmic in wind speed and the top wind speed for category to 4, as there is no upper limit for category 5 can be expressed as 83x10c15 miles per hour rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 except that after the change mentioned above category 4 is now widened by 1mph in each direction  the five categories are in order of increasing intensity12  category 1edit  Category1  sustainedwinds  most recent  3342 ms  6482

most well-constructed permanent structures however they can topple unanchored mobile homes as well as uproot or snap weak trees poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms power outages are typically widespread to extensive sometimes lasting several days even though it is the least intense type of hurricane the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.5  hurricanes that peaked at Category1 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include flossy gladys agnes juan

constructed doors and windows poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped mobile homes whether anchored or not are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely possibly lasting many days.5  hurricanes that peaked at Category2 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include able alice fifi diana calvin gert rosa erin alma juan

devastating damage will occur  tropical cyclones of category 3 and higher are described as major hurricanes in the atlantic or eastern pacific basins these storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures buildings that lack a solid foundation such as mobile homes are usually destroyed and gable-end roofs are peeled off manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures while larger structures are struck by floating debris a large number of trees are uprooted or snapped isolating many areas additionally terrain may be flooded well inland near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.5  hurricanes that peaked at Category3 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include easy carol hilda celia ella eloise olivia

with small utility buildings blown over or away collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls especially those with no interior supports is common very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood frame structures and total destruction to mobilemanufactured homes is prevalent only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact and only if located at least 3 to 5 miles to 8km inland they include office condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction public multi-story concrete parking garages and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concretecement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters unless all of these requirements are met the absolute destruction of a structure is certain.5  the storms flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked isolating most affected communities massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected possibly for up to several months.5  historical examples of storms that made landfall at category 5 status include day janet camille edith anita david gilbert andrew dean felix irma and maria no category 5 hurricane is known to have made landfall at that strength in the eastern pacific basin  criticismedit  some scientists including kerry emanuel and lakshmi kantha have criticized the scale as being simplistic indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces.7 additionally they and others point out that the saffirsimpson scale unlike the richter scale used to measure earthquakes is not continuous and is quantized into a small number of categories proposed replacement classifications include the hurricane intensity index which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storms winds and the hurricane hazard index which is based on surface wind speeds the radius of maximum winds of the storm and its translational velocity.1516 both of these scales are continuous akin to the richter scale17 however neither of these scales have been used by officials  6edit  after the series of powerful storm systems of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season a few newspaper columnists and scientists brought up the suggestion of introducing Category6, and they have suggested pegging Category6 to storms with winds greater than 174 or 180mph or 80ms 151 or 156kn 280 or 290kmh.718 only a few storms of this intensity have been recorded of the 33 hurricanes currently considered to have attained category 5 status in the atlantic 17 had wind speeds at 175mph 152kn 282kmh or greater and only seven had wind speeds at 180mph 160kn 290kmh or greater 1935 labor day hurricane allen gilbert mitch rita wilma and irma of the 15 hurricanes currently considered to have attained category 5 status in the eastern pacific only six had wind speeds at 175mph 152kn 282kmh or greater john linda rick and patricia and only three had wind speeds at 180mph 160kn 290kmh or greater rick and patricia however most storms which would be eligible for this category were typhoons in the western pacific most notably typhoon tip in 1979 with sustained winds of 190mph and typhoons haiyan and meranti in 2013 and 2016, respectively with sustained winds of 195mph  according to robert simpson there are no reasons for a Category6 on the saffirsimpson scale because it is designed to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures simpson stated that you get up into winds in excess of 155mph you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building its going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well its engineered.3 despite his statements the counties of broward and miami-dade in florida have building codes which require critical infrastructure buildings to be able to withstand Category5 winds,20
