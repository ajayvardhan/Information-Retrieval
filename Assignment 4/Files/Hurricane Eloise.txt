eastern united states  part of the 1975 atlantic hurricane season  hurricane eloise was the most destructive tropical cyclone of the 1975 atlantic hurricane season the fifth tropical storm fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season eloise formed as a tropical depression on september 13 to the east of the virgin islands the depression tracked westward and intensified into a tropical storm while passing to the north of puerto rico eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity soon thereafter but weakened back to a tropical storm upon making landfall over hispaniola a weak and disorganized cyclone eloise emerged into open waters of the northern caribbean sea upon striking the northern yucatan peninsula it turned north and began to re-intensify in the gulf of mexico the cyclone quickly matured and became a category 3 hurricane on september 23. eloise made landfall along the florida panhandle west of panama city before moving inland across alabama and dissipating on september 24.  the storm produced torrential rainfall throughout the islands of puerto rico and hispaniola causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities as eloise progressed westward it affected cuba to a lesser extent in advance of the storm about 100,000 residents evacuated from the gulf coast region upon making landfall in florida eloise generated wind gusts of 155miles per hour which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area the storms severe winds waves and storm surge left numerous beaches piers and other coastal structures heavily impaired  wind-related damage extended into inland alabama and georgia further north torrential rains along the entire east coast of the united states created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event especially into the mid-atlantic states in that region an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from hurricane agnes several years prior across the united states damage amounted to approximately the storm killed 80 people along its entire track due to the severe damage the name was retired from the atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3

intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the origins of hurricane eloise trace back to a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of africa on september 6, 1975. satellite imagery indicated that the system was initially disjointed and poorly developed although there was evidence of a low-level circulation the disturbance tracked westward for several days as it slowly matured on september 13, a ship called the gulf hansa recorded winds of around 25mph and 10 feet seas in association with the system shortly thereafter a reconnaissance aircraft found a center of circulation 575 miles east of the virgin islands and it is estimated that the storm became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC.12  the depression continued moving towards the west as it gradually strengthened on september 16, the system attained tropical storm status and was designated Eloise2 accordingly the first advisory on the system was issued by the san juan weather bureau office while in the vicinity of a strengthening anticyclone aloft eloise became better organized and the storm rapidly intensified and reached category 1 hurricane status 18 hours after being named the cyclone soon made landfall on the dominican republic inhibiting further development.1 although initially predicted to remain north of land the storm moved across northern hispaniola and then tracked across southeastern cuba after 36 hours with much of its circulation over mountainous terrain eloise deteriorated to a tropical storm on September17.1  the cyclone emerged over the open waters of the northern caribbean on september 19, passing jamaica to the north as it moved away from cuba despite favorable upper-level conditions its interaction with landcombined with the weakening of a ridge to the northleft the storms center distorted eloise remained a fairly disorganized tropical storm until september 20, when it approached the yucatan peninsula and began to re-intensify the storm crossed over the northern tip of the peninsula as it began to turn northward in response to an approaching trough between september 17 and september 21, however reports on the storm were scarce leading to uncertainty in its exact location and strength upon entering the gulf of mexico eloise quickly organized the trough enhanced the wind divergence over the storms center,1 allowing it to strengthen once again to reach hurricane force about 345 miles south of new orleans Louisiana.2  rainfall totals in puerto rico and the us virgin islands  on september 22, the cyclone intensified to attain category 2 strength and became a major hurricane of category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast.2 several ships penetrated the storms center during its passage through the gulf the hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm aiding meteorologists in their forecasts.1 hurricane eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125mph and a minimum barometric pressure of about 955 mbar 28.2 inHg.2 it moved ashore along the florida panhandle near panama city on september 23. shortly after making landfall the hurricane rapidly degenerated just six hours later it had weakened into a tropical storm while situated over eastern Alabama.1 it further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 utc on september 24. the depression transitioned into an extratropical storm over virginia and became indistinguishable by later that same day the remnant moisture however merged with a weather front to produce widespread and heavy precipitation.12  preparationsedit  in advance of hurricane eloise warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for puerto rico and the virgin islands a hurricane warning was declared for parts of the dominican republic about 12 hours before landfall.1 a emergency was put into effect for the oriente province of cuba while a of alert was issued for the camagey province cubana de aviacin suspended all flights to Oriente.3  on and before september 15, there was still uncertainty as to whether eloise would impact the united states however officials in florida began taking precautionary measures.4 when the storm entered the gulf of mexico forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near mobile bay contrary to predictions by late on september 22, the storm had turned northeast and some residents of florida were still unaware of the storms threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance.5 as a result evacuations were delayed to an extent.1 during the morning hours of september 23, civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter due of the intensity of the approaching hurricane evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough despite the initial delay it was reported that 99 of pensacola residents along the beach had left their homes and overall 100,000 people evacuated from areas in louisiana through Florida.5  a statement issued by the national weather service advised people in nine florida counties to complete hurricane preparations which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety.6 homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners,7 while offshore workers were removed from oil platforms a spokesman for royal dutch shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated.8 in new orleans emergency equipment was readied and inspected the new orleans levee board went into a second-stage alert on september 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.9  impactedit  caribbean seaedit  storm deaths by region  region  direct deaths  puerto rico  34  dominican republic  7  haiti  18  florida  4  united states elsewhere  17  total  80  as a weak tropical depression the storm brought 5 to 10 inches to 250mm of rainfall to portions of the leeward islands including st kitts and st martin more minor amounts of precipitation fell over the northernmost islands and winds were light in these areas.1  despite being only a tropical storm while passing by puerto rico eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island peaking at 33.29 inches in dos bocas other totals of 10 to 20 inches to 510mm were common.10 the heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people mostly from drownings and left million in damages.11 several hundred people were injured and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes dozens of towns and villages were flooded though utuado with a population of 35,000 at the time was hit the hardest the situation in that town was described as a disaster four housing developments were under water and dozens of vehicles were washed away.12 the flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges out-of-service.13  as the storm proceeded westward it dropped heavy rainfall throughout eastern and southern hispaniola widespread flooding impacted haiti and the dominican republic leaving a total of 25 people dead although the most intense winds remained offshore a gust of 50 miles per hour was recorded at cape Engao.1 puerto plata on the northern coast of the dominican republic was also battered by high winds and heavy rain following the storm electricity was turned off due to the danger of electrocutions.13 despite the storms effects across hispaniola and puerto rico no monetary damage totals are available  a beach house demolished by the hurricane  rain and wind from the storm affected the southern bahamas cuba jamaica the cayman islands and the northern yucatan peninsula since the storm was primarily weak while passing by these areas no significant damage was reported.1 eloise brought torrential rainfall and winds of 20mph to the guantanamo bay naval base in southeastern cuba inflicting in damage personnel on the base were moved to designated hurricane shelters in advance of the storm.14  floridaedit  eloise came ashore along the coast of northern florida as a category 3 storm producing winds of 90mph with gusts that reached 155mph sustained winds were likely higher but due to the sparsity of recording stations few official records exist the winds in the area were reportedly the strongest of the century.5 hurricane-force winds occurred from fort walton beach through panama city along the coast tides ran 12 to 16 feet to 4.9m above normal peaking at 18 feet hurricane eloise spawned several tornadoes as it pressed inland.1 in general rainfall ranged from 4 to 8 inches to 200mm at the eglin air force base near valparaiso however the hurricane dropped 14.9 inches of precipitation.10 the heaviest rainfall was usually confined to northwest of the storms track and a number of locations to the east of eloises center picked up less than 1 inch of rain.1  damage from the hurricane was widespread fort walton beach where hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed was hit particularly hard in some areas the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds the winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand throughout northwest florida an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses and 500 businesses were completely destroyed an article in the tallahassee democrat reported that motels restaurants convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn across the highway in a tangle of down power poles lines and busted mains.5 a 2,100-acre shrimp farm at panama city the first of its kind was effectively lost the storm destroyed the farms prospective initial harvest 1,500,000 pounds of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures the president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover followed by a quick and steady rebound by the spring of 1976, the company became confident in financial success and full recovery.1115  aerial view of the florida panhandle damage  the storm caused severe beach erosion in bay county approximately 801,000 cubic yards of sand was removed.16 storm-related changes in the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the panama city beach area the most severe damage was concentrated in a 22 miles area of the shore east of the hurricanes eye and storm surge peaked in intensity for no more than a half hour according to preliminary estimates much of the resultant damage came as a result of foundation undermining which was compared to that of the new england hurricane of 1938. although eloise was not abnormally strong the geographicy setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses.17 monetary losses from property damage in panama city beach alone totaled about million.18  the first major storm to strike the region in 40 years hurricane eloise did not directly kill anyone in the state of Florida.19 however four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane1 two of them were related to heart attacks numerous people sustained injuries largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts overall property damage from the storm in florida amounted to million.11 in the storms aftermath a study of the hurricanes effect on aquatic animals living in the swash zone immediate area where land and the ocean meet of panama city beach was conducted.18 the study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore however the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter.18 also along the shore the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers including the total destruction of a 300 feet extension of the okaloosa island pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span a fishing pier at st andrews state park also suffered vast damage along with another wooden pier at mexico beach and the mb miller pier at panama city beach which lost its end section to the storm.20  elsewhere in the united statesedit  as the hurricane progressed inland it passed over eastern alabama generating strong winds a gust of 100mph was recorded northeast of ozark winds elsewhere in the state ranged from around 35mph to 88mph precipitation in alabama peaked at 5.54 inches the high winds resulted in severe damage to property and crops amounting to million.1 eloise cut power and telephone service in the area,21 and in geneva county several people sustained storm-related injuries as in florida the weakening hurricane spawned a number of tornadoes in alabama and Georgia.22 preliminary reports indicated that every county in southeastern alabama received some damage from the storm the strong winds uprooted trees and knocked down powerlines heavy rain associated with the storm caused a leak in the alabama state capitol building roof.23 gusty winds moderate to heavy rainfall and low pressures extended into georgia louisiana and to a lesser extent Mississippi.1  rainfall totals from eloise in the united states  the remnants of eloise interacted with another weather system producing widespread precipitation across the eastern united states including portions of the ohio valley the mid-atlantic states and new England.10 the deluge was continuous during the period between september 22 and 26 according to a statement by the national weather Service.24 one of the highest rainfall totals in association with the storm occurred in westminster maryland where 14.23 inches of rain were recorded elsewhere 7 to 10 inches to 250mm or more of precipitation fell throughout parts of pennsylvania new jersey new york and connecticut at least 22 states received rainfall from hurricane eloise and its remnant moisture.10 nearby hurricane faye may have also contributed to the heavy rainfall although this connection was never confirmed.25 in washington dc 9.08 inches of rain contributed to the wettest september on record since 1934.26 the excessive rainfall led to extensive flooding throughout the region in some areas exceeding 50- to 100-year levels.27  pennsylvania and new york bore the brunt of the flooding which culminated in loss of life and severe property damage.25 along the central southern tier region of new york the storm damaged or destroyed over 700 structures.28 flooding throughout the northeastern united states disabled over a dozen water plants and at least 16 sewage treatment plants prompting a boil-water advisory in pennsylvanias capital city of harrisburg infrastructure further south also suffered in maryland the monocacy rivera tributary of the potomacswelled to 14 feet above flood stage inundating the city of frederick and compromising the citys supply of fresh drinking water.24 a final downpour of rain on the night of september 2526 led to an additional 4 inches of rain in central maryland triggered severe flash flooding in some cases this onslaught affected the same areas that were still recovering from hurricane agnes several years earlier including ellicott city elkridge and laurel where two major rivers breached their banks and engulfed nearby areas many homes and businesses were lost along with numerous vehicles in the aftermath looters entered on boats to access the devastated cities the floodgates at the rocky gorge dam in laurel were opened forcing 500 residents downstream to leave their homes.29  the consequences of the flooding rains were the worst seen in areas of the interior mid-atlantic states since agnes and comparisons were often drawn between the two hurricanes.24 in pennsylvania alone flooding from the remnants of eloise forced 20,000 residents out of their homes30 thousands further south in the washington dc area where severe flooding impacted the citys southern suburbs,31 also fled to seek refuge further many motorists throughout the region became stranded on highways inundated by floodwaters.30 four mile run and nearby streams overflowed and through residential neighborhoods hundreds of families in the alexandria and arlington virginia area suffered flood-related losses.31 across the northeastern us the storm system killed 17 people and inflicted million in damage.25 an instance of a storm-induced fatality is the death of a man in white plains new york who was killed by waters raging across the hutchinson river parkway agriculturally the extended period of wet weather threatened a range of crops including the rhode island apple crop of which 35 was feared to have been destroyed and corn and sweet potato fields in north carolina with ground too moist for farm machinery to operate on harvests were postponed.32  aftermathedit  eloise on september 22 in the gulf of mexico  after touring the disaster area florida governor reubin askew noted think were going to have to take a long close look at some of the construction some of the structures simply wont be able to be built back in the exact location where they were.11 governor askew recruited 400 national guard troops to prevent looting following the storm.33 he also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the florida panhandle as national disaster areas and stated that he would consider adding two more counties the declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid.34 immediately following the storm the mayor of panama city criticized the state of florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid.35 despite the destruction the storm reportedly had some economic benefits in the midst of rebuilding and recovery business grew especially in and around panama city and people began to move into the area.36 in at least one instance the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography breaching crooked island in bay county to create an inlet 0.75 miles wide referred to as eloise Inlet.37 eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the florida panhandle which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models in 1995, reports from the aftermath of hurricane opal created a more extensive collection of data.38  on september 26, president gerald ford approved the declaration for Florida,39 and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in pennsylvania as the storms flooding rains progressed northward.4041 pennsylvania lieutenant governor ernest kline assigned 600 national guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas.42 over million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by hurricane eloise along its entire course.43 in maryland governor marvin mandel placed 10 of the states 23 counties under a state of emergency.24 following the severe damage caused by hurricane eloise its name was retired at the end of the 1975 season as such the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the atlantic hurricane basin.44 however eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979.45  see alsoedit
