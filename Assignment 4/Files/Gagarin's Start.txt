LC-1 has been the primary facility for manned launches with occasional soyuz flights from LC-316.  LC-1 was damaged several times by booster explosions during the early years as of 2016, the most recent accident to occur on or around the pad was the attempted launch of soyuz T-10-1 in september 1983 ended disastrously when the booster caught fire during prelaunch preparations and exploded causing severe damage that left LC-1 inoperable for almost a year  galleryedit  soyuz TMA-16 launches from the gagarins start on september 30, 2009, on its way to the international space station  sunrise at the launch pad prior to the rollout of soyuz TMA-13, october 10, 2008.  progress M-13M launches on october 30, 2011.  the flame trench for gagarins start  see alsoedit  baikonur cosmodrome site 31  cape canaveral air force station launch complex 14, the equivalent for the united states first manned spaceflights  notesedit  suffredini spoke a soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft was being hoisted onto russias baikonur launch pad named start after the first man in space httpwww.chinadaily.com.cnenglishdoc2004-1013content381791.htm china daily 2004-10-13 on soyuz TMA-5 launch  origin of the test range in tyuratam at russianspacewebcom  russian creation and launch of the first earths satellite by vporoshkov archived 29 october 2005 at the wayback machine  a b baikonur LC1 archived 15 april 2009 at the wayback machine  gagarins pad  further readingedit  j k golovanov m facts and myths nauka 1994, ISBN5-02-000822-2  and people b e chertok m engineering 1999.
