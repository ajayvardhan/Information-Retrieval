least not like that.8 j marshall shepherd a research meteorologist at the nasa goddard space flight center expressed a similar sentiment heartened that theres a movie addressing real climate issues

an expert on thermohaline circulation and its effect on climate said after a talk with scriptwriter jeffrey nachmanoff at the films berlin preview  this is a disaster movie and not a scientific documentary the film makers have taken a lot of artistic license but the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades be just as surprised as jack hall if they did occur at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century and the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the depicted in the movie nevertheless a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences which we should avoid and even without events like ocean circulation changes climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action.18  environmental activist and guardian columnist george monbiot called the day after tomorrow
