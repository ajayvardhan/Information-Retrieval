meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the us mortgage market.132 vince reinhardt a former federal reserve economist now at the american enterprise institute said

additionally that it would have helped congress to have held hearings.126  in november 2008, over 500,000 jobs were lost which marked the largest loss of jobs in the united states in 34 years.133 the

initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of senator ted kennedy of Massachusetts.137 it was signed into law by bush in early 2002.138 many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the us have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed child left behind into law.139 critics argue that it is underfunded140 and that nclbas focus on testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.141  after being re-elected bush signed into law a medicare drug benefit program that according to jan crawford resulted in greatest expansion in americas welfare state in forty years the bills costs approached in 2007, bush opposed and vetoed state childrens health insurance program legislation which

asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as per year who did not need the help.144  social services and social security  following republican efforts to pass the medicare act of 2003, bush signed the bill which included major changes to the medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs while relying on private insurance for

partial privatization of the system personal social security accounts and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax into secured investments.147 democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.147  bush embarked on a 60-day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as on social security in an attempt to gain public support.148 nevertheless public support for the proposal declined149 and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.150 the proposals legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from hurricane Katrina.151 after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office  environmental policies  main

convention on climate change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the worlds population152 and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.153 he also cited that the senate had voted 950 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol  in may 2001, bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,154 and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.155  in 2002, bush announced the clear skies act of 2003,156 aimed at amending the clean air act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.157 the initiative was introduced to congress but failed to make it out of committee  later in 2006, bush declared the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date the papahnaumokukea marine national monument comprises 84million acres and is home to 7,000 species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands.158 the move was hailed by conservationists for foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible

administration has worked with congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil

testing has been questioned testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.172 on july 19, 2006, bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the dickey-wicker amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.173  genetic nondiscrimination  on may

enforcement measures a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based system for green cards elimination of migration and of the diversity immigrant visa and other measures bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of us laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.180 bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.181  a heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.182 the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 4653 vote.183 bush

point was enough.194  as the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administrations role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d Brown195 it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq War196 and

program remained highly classified.275 once the department of justice office of legal counsel questioned its original legal opinion that fisa did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently re-authorized by the president on the basis that the warrant requirements of fisa were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the authorization for use of military force against Terrorists.276 the program proved to be controversial as critics of the administration as well as organizations such as the american bar association argued that it was illegal.277 in august 2006, a us district court judge ruled that the nsa electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional,278 but on july 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.279 on january 17, 2007, attorney general alberto gonzales informed us senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the

and vice president cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal.287288 the cia had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the bybee memo from the attorney general though that memo was later withdrawn.289 while not permitted by the us army field manuals which assert harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information,287 the bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations critical information to preserve american lives.290 critics such as former cia officer bob baer have stated that information was suspect can get anyone to confess to anything if the tortures bad enough.291  on october 17, 2006, bush signed into law the military commissions act of 2006,292 a law enacted in the wake of the supreme courts decision in hamdan v rumsfeld 548 us 557 which allows the us government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial the

would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the united states army field
