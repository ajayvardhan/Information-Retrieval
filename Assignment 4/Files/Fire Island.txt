Island.4  the fire island inlet grew to 9 miles in width before receding the fire island lighthouse was built in 1858, right on the inlet but fire islands western terminus at democrat point has steadily moved west so that the lighthouse today is 6 miles from the inlet  fire island separated from southampton in a 1931 noreaster when moriches inlet broke through however this was expected the inlet widened on september 21, 1938. moriches inlet and efforts by local communities east of fire island to protect their beach front with jetties have led to an interruption in the longshore drift of sand going from east to west and is blamed for erosion of the fire island beachfront.5 between these major breaks there have been reports over the years of at least six inlets that broke through the island but have since disappeared  etymologyedit  entrance to board the ferry to cherry grove fire island  the origin of fire islands name is not certain it is believed its native american name was sictem hackey which translated to of the secatogues the secatogues were a tribe in the area of the current town of islip it was part of what was also called the Islands.6  the name of fire island first appeared on a deed in 1789.7  historian richard bayles suggested that the name derives from a misinterpretation or corruption of the dutch word vijf or in another version vier referring to the number of islands near the fire island inlet.8 at times histories have referred to it in the plural as islands because of the inlet breaks  other versions say the island derived its name from fires built on the seas edge by native americans or by pirates to lure unsuspecting ships into the sandbars some say it is how portions of the island look to be on fire from sea in autumn yet another version says it comes from the rash caused by poison ivy on the island.4  while the western portion of the island was referred to as fire island for many years the eastern portion was referred to as great south beach until 1920, when widespread development caused the whole land mass to be called fire Island.7  historyedit  fire island lighthouse east of robert moses field 5.  settlementedit

to legend the gay population began to concentrate in cherry grove at duffys hotel with christopher isherwood and w h auden dressed as dionysus and ganymede and carried aloft on a gilded litter by a group of singing followers.12 the gay influence was continued in the 1960s when male model john b whyte developed fire island pines the pines currently has some of the most expensive property on the island and accounts for two-thirds of the islands swimming pools.13  in 1964, robert moses built the captree causeway to the western end of the island.14 opponents fearing that this was the beginning

south end and 1,171 feet on february 28, 2013.15 officials have been debating whether to close the breach and let nature take its course as it has been flushing out the great south bay and improving water quality however residents of the bay front communities noted increased flooding after the storm this flooding was later found to be the result of several noreasters and unrelated to the breaches.16 as of 2015update, the breach remained open officials have moved to close the other two breaches which are on either side of moriches inletone in cupsogue county park and the other one being in smith point county Park.171819  reports indicated that 80 percent of the homes particularly those on the east end were flooded and 90 homes were completely destroyed.20 the storm also tore
