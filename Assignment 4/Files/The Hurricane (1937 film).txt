kersaint mitchell blows his former home a kiss when a fellow passenger asks him about the place he tells its tragic story segueing into a flashback  during the colonial era in the south pacific the natives of the island of manakoora are a contented lot terangi hall the first mate on an island-hopping schooner marries marama lamour the daughter of the chief kikume she has a premonition and begs him not to leave or at least take her with him on the ships next voyage but he makes her stay behind  upon reaching tahiti the crew goes to a bar to celebrate when a racist white man orders them to leave terangi strikes him and breaks his jaw unfortunately the man has strong political connections and the governor is forced to sentence him to six months in jail over the objections of terangis captain nagle cowan back on manakoora dr kersaint begs recently appointed local french governor eugene de laage massey to have terangi brought home to serve his sentence under parole but de laage refuses to compromise his stern interpretation of the law despite the pleas of captain nagle father paul aubrey smith and even his own wife astor  unable to bear being confined terangi repeatedly tries to escape lengthening his sentence by another 16 years much to the delight of a particularly harsh jailer carradine finally after eight years terangi succeeds in getting out but at a terrible price he unintentionally kills a guard he steals a canoe and returns to manakoora after an arduous journey at the end he is rescued from his overturned canoe by father paul who promises to remain silent  he is reunited with marama and a daughter de clercq he has never seen before chief mehevi recommends the family hide on a tabu island where no one will look for them however de laage discovers their preparations and commandeers the schooner to hunt them down  terangi turns back to warn his people after he sees birds fleeing the island an unprecedented ominous event that marama had dreamed about many years before a once-in-a-lifetime hurricane strikes the island a few among them dr kersaint and his pregnant patient weather the disaster in a canoe while terangi ties his family and madame de laage to a stout tree the rest drown and the island is stripped bare  the tree floats away terangi later finds a war canoe in the water which he uses to get his party to a small island when they spot the schooner terangi signals it with smoke before fleeing in the canoe with his family governor de laage embraces his wife but then spots something far away through his binoculars madame de laage insists it must be a floating log suspecting tarangi saved his wife after a pause he agrees with her  castedit  dorothy lamour as marama  jon hall as terangi  mary astor as madame germaine de laage  c

Sound.1  best sound recording thomas t moulton  best supporting actor thomas mitchell  best music score alfred newman  critical receptionedit  new york times critic frank s nugent praised the climactic special effect created by james basevi stating is a hurricane to blast you from the orchestra pit to the first mezzanine it is a hurricane to film your eyes with spin-drift to beat at your ears with its thunder to clutch at your heart and send your diaphragm vaulting over your floating rib into the region just south of your tonsils.2 he complimented the performances of all of the principal actors with the exception of hall whose terangi was described as competent Tarzan.2 nugent also faulted the uneven pacing but in the end characterized the film as of the most thrilling spectacles the screen has provided this year.2  literary referencesedit  in his memoir la tregua truce re-titled the reawakening for publication in the us primo levi recounted his experience watching the hurricane among other films while he was interned at a soviet transit camp at starye dorogi in the aftermath of world war ii the audience of soviet troops former prisoners of war and holocaust survivors included became more and more unruly as the movie progressed culminating in what levi called a sabbath when the actual hurricane appeared on screen a fight broke out in the cramped theater and the projectionist decided to shut off the film before the end to levis dismay recalled the film as a good american film of the thirties  remakeedit  a remake of this movie was released in 1979,
