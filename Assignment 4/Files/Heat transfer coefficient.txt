heat transfer coefficient  the heat transfer coefficient or film coefficient or film effectiveness in thermodynamics and in mechanics is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat the temperature difference t  where  q amount of heat transferred flux Wm2 ie thermal power per unit area q dda  h heat transfer coefficient Wm2K  t difference in temperature between the solid surface and surrounding fluid area k  it is used in calculating the heat transfer typically by convection or phase transition between a fluid and a solid the heat transfer coefficient has si units in watts per squared meter kelvin Wm2K.  the heat transfer coefficient is the reciprocal of thermal insulance this is used for building materials and for clothing insulation  there are numerous methods for calculating the heat transfer coefficient in different heat transfer modes different fluids flow regimes and under different thermohydraulic conditions often it can be estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity of the convection fluid by a length scale the heat transfer coefficient is often calculated from the nusselt number dimensionless number there are also online calculators available specifically for heat transfer fluid applications experimental assessment of the heat transfer coefficient poses some challenges especially when small fluxes are to be measured  contents  1 composition  2 convective heat transfer correlations  2.1 external flow vertical plane  2.2 external flow vertical cylinders  2.3 external

elements such as walls in buildings or across heat exchangers is shown below note that this method only accounts for conduction within materials it does not take into account heat transfer through methods such as radiation the method is as follows  where  the overall heat transfer coefficient  the contact area for each fluid side and expressing either surface  the thermal conductivity of the material  the individual convection heat transfer coefficient for each fluid  the wall thickness  as the areas for each surface approach being equal the equation can be written as the transfer coefficient per unit area as shown below  or  it is to be noted that often the value for is referred to as the difference of two radii where the inner and outer radii are used to define the thickness of a pipe carrying a fluid however this figure may also be considered as a wall thickness in a flat plate transfer mechanism or other common flat surfaces such as a wall in a building when the area difference between each edge of the transmission surface approaches zero  in the walls of buildings the above formula can be used to derive the formula commonly used to calculate the heat through building components architects and engineers call the resulting values either the u-value or the r-value of a construction assembly like a wall each type of value or u are related as the inverse of each other such that r-value 1U-Value and both are more fully understood through the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient described in lower section of this document  convective heat transfer correlationsedit  although convective heat transfer can be derived analytically through dimensional analysis exact analysis of the boundary layer approximate integral analysis of the boundary layer and analogies between energy and momentum transfer these analytic approaches may not offer practical solutions to all problems when there are no mathematical models applicable therefore many correlations were developed by various authors to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient in various cases including natural convection forced convection for internal flow and forced convection for external flow these empirical correlations are presented for their particular geometry and flow conditions as the fluid properties are temperature dependent they are evaluated at the film temperature which is the average of the surface and the surrounding bulk temperature  external flow vertical planeedit  recommendations by churchill and chu provide the following correlation for natural convection adjacent to a vertical plane both for laminar and turbulent flow.34 k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid l is the characteristic length with respect to the direction of gravity ral is the rayleigh number with respect to this length and pr is the prandtl number  for laminar flows the following correlation is slightly more accurate it is observed that a transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary occurs when ral exceeds around 109.  external flow vertical cylindersedit  for cylinders with their axes vertical the expressions for plane surfaces can be used provided the curvature effect is not too significant this represents the limit where boundary layer thickness is small relative to cylinder diameter the correlations for vertical plane walls can be used when  where is the grashof number  external flow horizontal platesedit  w h mcadams suggested the following correlations for horizontal plates.5 the induced buoyancy will be different depending upon whether the hot surface is facing up or down  for a hot surface facing up or a cold surface facing down for laminar flow  and for turbulent flow  for a hot surface facing down or a cold surface facing up for laminar flow  the characteristic length is the ratio of the plate surface area to perimeter if the surface is inclined at an angle with the vertical then the equations for a vertical plate by churchill and chu may be used for up to 60 if the boundary layer flow is laminar the gravitational constant g is replaced with g cos when calculating the ra term  external flow horizontal cylinderedit  for cylinders of sufficient length and negligible end effects churchill and chu has the following correlation for  external flow spheresedit  for spheres t yuge has the following correlation for Pr1 and  forced convectionedit  internal flow laminar flowedit  sieder and tate has the following correlation for laminar flow in tubes where is the internal diameter is the fluid viscosity at the bulk mean temperature is the viscosity at the tube wall surface temperature.6  internal flow turbulent flowedit  see also dittus-boelter equation  the dittus-blter correlation is a common and particularly simple correlation useful for many applications this correlation is applicable when forced convection is the only mode of heat transfer ie there is no boiling condensation significant radiation etc the accuracy of this correlation is anticipated to be 15.  for a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a reynolds number between 10,000 and 120,000 the turbulent pipe flow range when the fluids prandtl number is between 0.7 and 120, for a location far from the pipe entrance than 10 pipe diameters more than 50 diameters according to many authors7 or other flow disturbances and when the pipe surface is hydraulically smooth the heat transfer coefficient between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface can be expressed explicitly as  where  is the hydraulic diameter  is the thermal conductivity of the bulk fluid  is the fluid viscosity  mass flux  isobaric heat capacity of the fluid  is 0.4 for heating hotter than the bulk fluid and 0.33 for cooling cooler than the bulk fluid.8  the fluid properties necessary for the application of this equation are evaluated at the bulk temperature thus avoiding iteration  forced convection external flowedit  in analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions for flow parallel to a plane surface where is the distance from the edge and is the height of the boundary layer a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn analogy.6  thom correlationedit  there exist simple fluid-specific correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water or saturated at pressures up to about 20 mpa under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat flux9  where  is the wall temperature elevation above the saturation temperature k  q is the heat flux MWm2  p is the pressure of water mpa  note that this empirical correlation is specific to the units given  heat transfer coefficient of pipe walledit  the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a transfer coefficient of the pipe wall however one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter selecting to base the heat flux on the pipe inner diameter and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curvedcitation needed  where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thickness  if the above assumption does not hold then the wall heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following expression  where di and do are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectively  the thermal conductivity of the tube material usually depends on temperature the mean thermal conductivity is often used  combining heat transfer coefficientsedit  for two or more heat transfer processes acting in parallel heat transfer coefficients simply add  for two or more heat transfer processes connected in series heat transfer coefficients add inversely10  for example consider a pipe with a fluid flowing inside the approximate rate of heat transfer between the bulk of the fluid inside the pipe and the pipe external surface is11  where  q heat transfer rate  h heat transfer coefficient  t wall thickness  k wall thermal conductivity  a area  difference in temperature  overall heat transfer coefficientedit  the overall heat transfer coefficient is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in heat exchangers but can be applied equally well to other problems  for the case of a heat exchanger can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship  where  heat transfer rate  overall heat transfer coefficient  heat transfer surface area  logarithmic mean temperature difference  the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances more complex relationships exist for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel  where  r resistances to heat flow in pipe wall  other parameters are as above.12  the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid side  the thermal resistance due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship  where  x the wall thickness  k the thermal conductivity of the material  a the total area of the heat exchanger  this represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipe  the thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the particular material values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the list of thermal conductivities  as mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid flow properties and temperature properties  some typical heat transfer coefficients include  air h 10 to 100 Wm2K  water h 500 to 10,000 Wm2K.  thermal resistance due to fouling depositsedit  often during their use heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which in addition to potentially contaminating a stream reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through due to this new layer there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling resistance13   where  overall heat transfer coefficient for a fouled heat exchanger  perimeter of the heat exchanger may be either the hot or cold side perimeter however it must be the same perimeter on both sides of the equation  overall heat transfer coefficient for an unfouled heat exchanger  fouling resistance on the cold side of the heat exchanger  fouling resistance on the hot side of the heat exchanger  perimeter of the cold side of the heat exchanger  perimeter of the hot side of the heat exchanger  this equation uses the overall heat transfer coefficient of an unfouled heat exchanger and the fouling resistance to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient of a fouled heat exchanger the equation takes into account that the perimeter of the heat exchanger is different on the hot and cold sides the perimeter used for the does not matter as long as it is the same the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the product will remain the same  the fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known the product of the average thickness and thermal conductivity will result in the fouling resistance on a specific side of the heat exchanger.13   where  average
