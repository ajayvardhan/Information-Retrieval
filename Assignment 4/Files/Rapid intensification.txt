rapid intensification  from rapid deepening  typhoon higos undergoing rapid intensification  rapid intensification is a meteorological condition that occurs when a tropical cyclone intensifies dramatically in a short period of time the united states national hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 55kmh in a 24-hour period.1  contents  1 necessary conditions  1.1 external  1.2 internal  2 previous nomenclature and definitions  3 notable instances  4 see also  5 references  necessary conditionsedit  externaledit  in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely warm or above 30C, 86F, and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface wind shear must be low when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted  internaledit  usually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as wellfor extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently.2further explanation needed hot towers have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification though diagnostically has seen varied skill across basins.3  previous nomenclature and definitionsedit  the united states national hurricane center previously defined rapid deepening of a tropical cyclone when the minimum central pressure decreased by 42 millibars over a 24-hour period.4when however it is now defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 55kmh in a 24-hour period.1 the term explosive cyclogenesis has been confused with rapid intensification in the literaturecitation needed however due to the redefinition based on sustained wind speeds rapid intensification is being applied to tropical systems while explosive cyclogenesis and associated terms to extratropical cyclonescitation needed  notable

events ever recorded with the pressure dropping from 975 to 885 millibars as it went from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 24 hours.56  in 1992, hurricane andrew was just a minimum hurricane a day before making landfall in the bahamas when it began to rapidly deepen into a category 5 hurricane right up to its landfall at peak strength it weakened significantly over the island chain but it soon hit open water again and rapidly intensified back into a category 5 hurricane just hours before making a second landfall at category 5 strength in Florida.7  on september 10, 1997, hurricane linda was just a tropical storm the next day linda became a minimal hurricane by 6AM on september 12, however lindas wind speeds increased to a record 185mph, the pressure dropping at an average rate of 3.38 millibars per hour.8  in 2004, hurricane charley was approaching the west coast of florida as a category two storm on the saffir-simpson scale of hurricane strength when just off the coast however its sustained winds rapidly increased from 110 to 150mph with a pressure drop from 965 to 941mbar in only three hours charley caused unprecedented destruction in the punta gorda area and inflicted major damage across the state of Florida.9  hurricane wilma at record intensity  during 2005, hurricane wilma sustained winds rapidly intensified from 60 knots 110kmh to 150 knots 280kmh within 24 hours.10 as a result wilma intensified from being a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale.10 over the same time span the pressure dropped from 982 millibars to 892 millibars hurricane katrina and hurricane rita both rapidly intensified katrina from a category 2 to a 5, and rita from a 2 to a 5. katrina rapidly weakened as a result dropping one category every 6 hours rita kept cat 5 intensity for 24 hours before slowly weakening to a category 3 and dropping to a cat 1 just after landfall  in 2006, the minimum central pressure of typhoon chebi in the western pacific dropped 75 mbar in 24 hours including a 60 mbar pressure drop in 6 hours as it intensified from a tropical storm to a category four equivalent typhoon in one advisory.11  in 2007, hurricane felix rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a category 5 hurricane in 51 hours with a wind speed rise of 85knots98mph in just 24 hours.12  2008s hurricane ike with the hurricane undergoing a 24 millibar pressure drop in 3 hours  in 2010, there were multiple occurrences igor julia earl danielle and karl are prime examples each intensified from a minimal hurricane into a category 4 3 for karl  in 2013, typhoon usagi underwent a 55 mb drop as it had intensified from a category 1 to a category 4 super typhoon in just 24 hours typhoon lekima rapidly intensified from a category 1 to category 5 in 24 hours and most notably typhoon haiyan deepened from 35 mb within 12 hours and 965 mb to 895 mb within a day  in 2014, cyclones gillian and hellen underwent rapid intensification going from tropical storms to category 5 cyclones in less than 48 hrs barely a week apart  a few instances have been recorded in the north indian ocean such as the 1999 odisha cyclone the strongest storm on record in the basin undergoing a 28 millibar pressure drop in 6 hours and cyclone giri undergoing 24 millibar drop in 6 hours.13  in may 2014, hurricane amanda rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a Category4 in 24hours. over the span of 30hours, its central pressure decreased by 62mbar 1.83inHg while its winds increased by 95mph  in august 2014, hurricane genevieve underwent explosive intensification while crossing the international date line from a tropical storm to a category 5 typhoon in 30 hours with a wind speed rise of 90 knots hurricane marie rapidly deepened from category 1 at 200 pm pdt on august 23 to category 5 with sustained winds of 160mph to 195mph at 200 pm pdt on august 24, the pressure dropping from 988mbar to 918mbar average of 2.916 millibars per hour during that same period  in september 2014, hurricane odile rapidly intensified from a category 1 into a category 4, with pressure dropping to 918 mbar hurricane simon intensified from a tropical storm into a category 4 hurricane  in october 2014, typhoon vongfong deepened 30 mbar in 6 hours and 65 mbar in just a day  in november 2014, typhoon nuri explosively intensified from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 18 hours its pressure had dropped from 975 mbar to 910 mbar  in december 2014, typhoon hagupit explosively intensified from a category 3 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon for 12 hours with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 215kmh and the central pressure at 905 hpa inhg  in february 2015, tropical cyclone marcia developed in the coral sea of the queensland coast in australia it was named a category 1 scale cyclone by the bureau of meteorology on 18 february and underwent a period of very rapid intensification on 19 february reaching category 4 status the following morning it was upgraded to category 5 status before crossing the coast north of yeppoon queensland meanwhile in the northwest pacific typhoon higos rapidly deepened 45 millibars in 30 hours  in late march 2015, typhoon maysak rapidly intensified from a category 2 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon in a day and became the strongest storm before april within the basin in early may typhoon noul also rapidly intensified from a category 2 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon within a similar timeframe with a 45 millibar drop typhoon dolphin rapidly intensified from a category 2 to a category 5 within 24 hours  in october 2015, hurricane patricia underwent explosive intensification the storm reached hurricane status just before 0000 on october 22, and reached category 4 status 18 hours later patricia further intensified to reach category 5 status the next day and peaked with winds of 215mph by 1200 utc on october 23. patricias winds increased a record 120mph. despite this in the five hours until landfall an eyewall replacement cycle resulted in traumatic weakening winds decreased 65mph before landfall however with winds of 150mph, patricia still holds the record for the strongest mexican landfall on the pacific side  in september 2017, hurricane maria explosively intensified from a category 1 with a pressure of 982 mbar 29.00 inhg to a category 5 with a pressure of 925mbar 28.23 inhg in under a 24-hour period  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  tropical cyclone  list of the most intense tropical
