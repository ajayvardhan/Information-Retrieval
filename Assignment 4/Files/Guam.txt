first european to visit the island on march 6, 1521. guam was colonized by spain in 1668 with settlers including diego luis de san vitores a catholic jesuit missionary between the 16th century and the

of the globe  the original inhabitants of guam and the northern mariana islands were the chamorro people who are believed to be descendants of austronesian people originating from southeast asia as early as 2000 BC.1316  the ancient chamorro society had four classes chamorri matua class achaot class and manachang class.132021 the matua were located in the coastal villages which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds whereas the manachang were located in the interior of the island matua and manachang rarely communicated with each other and matua often used achaot as intermediaries there were also to shamans skilled in healing and medicine belief in spirits of ancient chamorros called mona still persists as a remnant of pre-european culture their society was organized along matrilineal clans.1321  latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the mariana islands they are a recent development in pre-contact chamorro society the latte-stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built.1326 latte stones consist of a base shaped from limestone called the haligi and with a capstone or tsa made either from a large brain coral or limestone placed on top.132728 a possible source for these stones the rota latte stone quarry was discovered in 1925 on Rota.1328  magellans travel to guamedit  the first european to travel to guam was portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan sailing for the king of spain when he sighted the island on march 6, 1521, during his fleets circumnavigation of the globe.134142 when magellan arrived on guam he was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water due to their considerable speed these outrigger canoes were called proas and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas of the lateen sails antonio pigafetta of magellans original 18 said that the name was of sails but he also writes that the inhabitants the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on including small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship.14129 people are poor but ingenious and very thievish on account of which we called those three islands islas de los ladrones of thieves.14131  spanish colonization and the manila galleonsedit  despite magellans visit guam was not officially claimed by spain until january 26, 1565, by general miguel lpez de Legazpi.1346 from 1565 to 1815, guam and the northern mariana islands the only spanish outpost in the pacific ocean east of the philippines was an important resting stop for the manila galleons a fleet that covered the pacific trade route between acapulco and Manila.1351 to protect these pacific fleets spain built several defensive structures that still stand today such as fort nuestra seora de la soledad in umatac guam is the biggest single segment of micronesia the largest islands between the island of kyushu new guinea the philippines and the hawaiian islands  spanish colonization commenced on june 15, 1668, with the arrival of diego luis de san vitores and pedro calungsod who established the first catholic church.1364 the islands were part of the spanish east indies governed from the philippines which were in turn part of the viceroyalty of new spain based in mexico city other reminders of colonial times include the old governors palace in plaza de espaa and the spanish bridge both in hagata guams cathedral dulce nombre de maria was formally opened on february 2, 1669, as was the royal college of san juan de Letran.1368 guam along with the rest of the mariana and caroline islands were treated as part of spains colony in the philippines while the islands chamorro culture has indigenous roots the cultures of both guam and the northern marianas have many similarities with spanish culture due to three centuries of spanish rule.5  internal conflictsedit  intermittent warfare lasting from july 23, 1670, until july 1695, plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693, and in particular the smallpox epidemic of 1688, reduced the chamorro population from 50,000 to 10,000 to less than 5,000.1386 precipitated by the death of quipuha and the murder of father san vitores and pedro calungsod by local rebel chief matapang tensions led to a number of conflicts captain juan de santiago started a campaign to conquer the island which was continued by the successive commanders of the spanish forces.136874  after his arrival in 1674, captain damian de esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as chochogo pepura tumon sidia-aty sagua nagan and Ninca.137475 starting in june 1676, the first spanish governor of guam capt francisco de irrisarri y vinar controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions he also ordered the construction of schools roads and other infrastructure.137576 later capt jose de quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors he also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated father san vitores resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands eventually leading to the death of matapang hurao and Aguarin.137778 quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to guam ordering the population to live in a few large villages.137879 these included jinapsan umatac pago agat and inarajan where he built a number of churches.1379 by july 1695, quiroga had completed the conquest of guam rota tinian and Aguigan.1385  expulsion of the jesuitsedit  on february 26, 1767, charles iii of spain issued a decree confiscating the property of the jesuits and banishing them from spain and her possessions.13101 as a consequence the jesuit fathers on guam departed on november 2, 1769, on the schooner nuestra seora de guadalupe abandoning their churches rectories and ranches.13102103  the arrival of governor don mariano tobias on september 15, 1771, brought agricultural reforms including making land available to the islanders for cultivation encouraged the development of cattle raising imported deer and water buffalo from manila donkeys and mules from acapulco established cotton mills and salt pans free public schools and the first guam militia.13107109 later he was transferred to manila in june 1774.13113  post-napoleonic eraedit  following the napoleonic wars many spanish colonies in the western hemisphere had become independent shifting the economic dependence of guam from mexico to the Philippines.13144 don francisco ramon de villalobos who became governor in 1831, improved economic conditions including the promotion of rice cultivation and the establishment of a leper hospital.13148149  otto von kotzebue visited the island in november 1817,13127 and louis de freycinet in march 1819.13134 jules dumont durville made two visits the first in may 1828.13139 the island became a rest stop for whalers starting in 1823.13145  a devastating typhoon struck the island on august 10, 1848, followed by a severe earthquake on january 25, 1849, which resulted in many refugees from the caroline islands victims of the resultant tsunami.13151 after a smallpox epidemic killed 3,644 guamanians in 1856, carolinians and japanese were permitted to settle in the Marianas.13157 guam received nineteen filipino prisoners after their failed 1872 cavite mutiny.13160  spanishamerican war and world war iiedit  us marines laying machine gun fire on a japanese sniper nest during the liberation battle on guam 28, 1944  after almost four centuries as part of the kingdom of spain and its 400 year old globe-girdling spanish empire the united states occupied the island following spains defeat in the 1898 spanishamerican war as part of the treaty of paris of 1898. guam was transferred to the united states navy control on december 23, 1898, by executive order 108-A from 25th president william mckinley guam came to serve as a station for american merchant and warships traveling to and from the philippines american acquisition from spain while the northern mariana islands were sold by spain to germany for part of its rapidly expanding german empire then following the german defeat in world war i became a league of nations mandate in 1919 with the nearby empire of japan as the mandatory as a member nation of the victorious allies in the War.5 a us navy yard was established at piti in 1899, and a united states marine corps barracks at sumay in 1901.1513 following the philippineamerican war known as the philippine insurrection 1899-1902, rebel nationalist leaders emilio aguinaldo and apolinario mabini were exiled on guam in 1901 after their capture.16vi  a marine seaplane unit was stationed in guam from 1921 to 1930, the first in the Pacific.1513 pan american world airways established a seaplane base on the island for its trans-pacific san francisco-manila-hong kong route and the commercial pacific cable company had earlier built a telegraphtelephone station in 1903 for its trans-oceanic communication line.1515 during world war ii guam was attacked and invaded by japan on monday december 8, 1941, shortly after the attack on pearl harbors american pacific fleet and navalair bases in hawaii hours before in addition japan made major military moves into southeast asia and the east indies islands of the south pacific ocean against the british and dutch colonies opening a new wider pacific phase in the second world war  battle of guam july 1944  the northern mariana islands had become a league of nations mandate assigned to japan in 1919, pursuant to the treaty of versailles of 1919. it was the chamorros indigenous island people from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military after the war this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas guams chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them whereas having been administered by japan for over 30 years the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to the japanese government  the japanese occupation of guam lasted for approximately thirty-one months during this period the indigenous people of guam were subjected to forced labor family separation incarceration execution concentration camps and forced prostitution approximately one thousand people died during the occupation according to later congressional committee testimony in 2004. some historians estimate that war violence killed 10 of guams then 20,000 population.17  the united states returned and fought the battle of guam from july 21 to august 10, 1944, to recapture the island from japanese military occupation more than 18,000 japanese were killed as only 485 surrendered sergeant shoichi yokoi who surrendered in january 1972, appears to have been the last confirmed japanese holdout for 28 years in the forested back country on Guam.18 the united states also captured and occupied the nearby northern marianas islands  north field was established in 1944, and was renamed for brigadier general james roy andersen of the old us army air forces as andersen air force base  post-waredit  B-52 at andersen air force base during operation linebacker ii in vietnam war 1972  after world war ii the guam organic act of 1950 established guam as an unincorporated organized territory of the united states provided for the structure of the islands civilian government and granted the people us citizenship the governor of guam was federally appointed until 1968, when the guam elective governor act provided for the offices popular election.19242 since guam is not a us state us citizens residing on guam are not allowed to vote for president and their congressional representative is a non-voting member.5 they do however get to vote for party delegates in presidential primaries.20  vietnam war and lateredit  see also

to the east challenger deep the deepest surveyed point in the oceans is southwest of guam at 35,797 feet meters deep the highest point in guam is mount lamlam at an elevation of 1,334 feet meters.24  the island of guam is 30 miles long and 4 to 12 miles to 19km wide three-fourths the size of singapore the island experiences occasional earthquakes due to its location on the western edge of the pacific plate and near the philippine sea plate in recent years earthquakes with epicenters near guam have had magnitudes ranging from 5.0 to 8.7. unlike the anatahan volcano in the northern mariana islands guam is not volcanically active however due to its proximity to anatahan vog volcanic smog does occasionally affect Guam.25  a coral table reef surrounds most of guam and the limestone plateau provides the source for most of the islands fresh water steep coastal cliffs dominate the north while the southern end of the island is mountainous with lower hills in between.1  climateedit  guam experiences a tropical rainforest climate af though its driest month of march almost averages dry enough to qualify as a tropical monsoon climate moderated by seasonal easterly trade winds the weather is generally very warm with little seasonal temperature variation the mean high temperature is 86F or 30C and mean low is 76F with an average annual rainfall between 1981 and 2010 of around 98 inches or 2,490 millimetres temperatures rarely exceed 90F or fall below 70F the relative humidity commonly exceeds 84 percent at night throughout the year but the average monthly humidity hovers near 66 percent the dry season runs from december to june the remaining months to november constitute the wet season the months of january and february are considered the coolest months of the year with overnight low temperatures of 70 to 75F to 23.9C and generally less oppressive humidity levels the highest temperature ever recorded in guam was 96F on april 18, 1971, and april 1, 1990, and the

such as easter and christmas became widespread post-contact chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn and includes tortillas tamales atole and chilaquiles which are a clear influence from mesoamerica principally mexico from spanish trade with asia  the modern chamorro language has many historical parallels to modern philippine languages in that it is an austronesian language which has absorbed much spanish vocabulary it is a malayo-polynesian language along with such languages as tagalog indonesian hawaiian and even maori despite being spoken in the mid pacific ocean which is geographically closer to speakers of the polynesian islands chamorro is actually an outlier of the sundasulawesi languages subgroup chamorro is thus more closely related to and a part of the languages of the malay archipelago rather than its neighbours in polynesia among the languages of malay archipelago chamorro is most closely related to the languages in the south of the chain of islands within indonesia rather than the languages of the north in the philippines with which it shares linguistic spanish colonial influence  also like filipinos many chamorros possess spanish surnames despite few of the inhabitants actually descending from the spanish colonisers spanish names and surnames were adopted after their conversion to roman catholic christianity in a phenomenon prompted by the imposition of the catlogo alfabtico de apellidos in guam and other territories of the spanish east indies most notably the philippines  due to foreign cultural influence from spain most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-hispanic culture in the last few decades some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands

interdependence is the key or central value in chamorro culture inafamaolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing this is the armature or core that everything in chamorro culture revolves

of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the us mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identitycitation

presidential race these delegates are elected by local party conventions.5  political statusedit  in the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant movement in favor of this us territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self-government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed because its clauses were incompatible with the territorial clause iv sec 3, cl 2 of the us constitution other movements advocate us statehood for guam union with the state of hawaii or union with the northern mariana islands as a single territory or independence.42  in a 1982 plebiscite voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth statuscitation needed the island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on decolonization since 1998. governor eddie baza calvo intended to include one during the islands november 2016 elections but it was delayed again.43  eddie baza calvo governor of guam  a commission on decolonization was established in 1997 to educate the people of guam about the various political status options in its relationship with the us statehood free association and independence the group was dormant for some years in 2013, the commission began seeking funding to start a public education campaign there were few subsequent developments until late 2016. in early december 2016, the commission scheduled a series of education sessions in various villages about the current status of guams relationship with the us and the self-determination options that might be considered.43 the commissions current executive director is edward alvarez and there are ten members the group is also expected to release position papers on independence and statehood but the contents have not yet been completed.44  the united nations is in favor of greater self-determination for guam and other such territories the uns special committee on decolonization has agreed to endorse the governors education plan the commissions may 2016 report states academics from the university of guam commission was working to create and approve educational materials the office of the governor was collaborating closely with the commission in developing educational materials for the public.45  the united states department of the interior had approved a grant for decolonization education edward alvarez told the united nations pacific regional seminar in may 2016. are hopeful that this might indicate a shift in states policy to its non-self-governing territories such as guam where they will be more willing to engage in discussions about our future and offer true support to help push us towards true self-governances and self-determination.46  villagesedit  main article villages of guam  guam is divided into nineteen municipalities called villages  agana heights  agat  asanmaina  barrigada  chalanpagoordot  dededo

viewed as a key military hub that will further allow us military power to be projected via sea and sky  the us military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on guam and moving 8,600 marines and 9,000 of their dependents to guam from okinawa japan including the required construction workers this buildup would increase guams population by 45. in a february 2010 letter the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs.48 by 2012, these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 marines stationed on the island two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents.49  with the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of us marines from okinawa japan to guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40 of the entire landmass of guam  in january 2011, the ike skelton national defense authorization act for FY2011 indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning us marine corps service members and their families from okinawa to guam the transfer may be as late as 2020. in addition the defense authorization act cut approximately million from the 2011 budget request  villagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways many villagers serve in the military or are retired many active duty personnel and defense department civilians also live in the villages outside of the military installation areas the military and village communities have programs where guams population

1997 code 671 became nanp area code 671,50 removing the barrier of high-cost international long-distance calls to the us mainland  guam is also a major hub for submarine cables between the western us hawaii australia and asia guam currently serves twelve submarine cables with most continuing to china  cover carried both directions on the first commercial flights between guam and the united states october 524, 1935.  in 1899, the local postage stamps were overprinted as was done for the other former spanish colonies but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular us postage stamps have been used ever since because guam is also part of the us postal system abbreviation gu zip code range 9691096932, mail to guam from the us mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required private shipping companies such as fedex ups and dhl however have no obligation to do so and do not regard guam as domestic  the speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year light first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland but larger first-class or priority items can take a week or two fourth-class mail such as magazines are transported by sea after reaching hawaii most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to instead of to avoid being routed the long way through the us mainland and possibly charged a higher rate from asia  the commercial port of guam is the islands lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based shipping line matson inc whose container ships connect guam with honolulu hawaii los angeles california oakland california and seattle washington the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the micronesian region the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the islands us department of defense installations andersen air force base and commander naval forces marianas and eventually the third marine expeditionary force  guam is served by the antonio b won pat international airport which is a hub for united airlines the island is outside the united states customs zone so guam is responsible for establishing and operating its own customs and quarantine agency and jurisdiction therefore the us customs and border protection only carries immigration not customs functions since guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction passengers arriving directly from the united states skip immigration and proceed directly to guam customs and quarantine  however due to the guam and cnmi visa waiver program for certain countries an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on guam for flights to the states for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to guam on flights from guam to the northern mariana islands no immigration check is performed traveling between guam and the states through a foreign point however does require a passport  most residents travel within guam using personally owned vehicles the local government currently outsources the only public bus system regional transit authority and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations  ecologyedit  brown tree snakeedit  brown tree snake  believed to be a stowaway on a us military transport near the end of world war ii the brown tree snake irregularis was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the islands cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the regions islands.5152  before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail koko bird in chamorro and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction.53 according to many elders koko birds were common in guam before world war II.54  other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including Rota.53  guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of birdsong.5556  forest on guam swathed in spider webs  coconut rhinoceros beetleedit  coconut rhinoceros beetle  an infestation of the coconut rhinoceros beetle oryctes rhinoceros was detected on guam on september 12, 2007. crb is not known to occur in the united states except in american samoa delimiting surveys performed september 1325, 2007, indicated that the infestation was limited to tumon bay and faifai beach an area of approximately 900 acres guam department of agriculture placed quarantine on all properties within the tumon area on october 5 and later expanded the quarantine to about 2,500 acres on october 25 approximately 0.5 miles radius in all directions from all known locations of crb infestation crb is native to southern asia and distributed throughout asia and the western pacific including sri lanka upolu samoa american samoa palau new britain west irian new ireland pak island and manus island guinea fiji cocos islands mauritius and reunion  other invasive animal speciesedit  adult female carabao and calf  from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries the spanish introduced pigs dogs chickens the philippine deer mariannus black francolins and carabao subspecies of water buffalo which have cultural significance herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective the us military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents.57  other introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937, the giant african snail agricultural pest introduced during world warii by japanese occupation troops and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as coqu that may have arrived from hawaii have led to fears that the noise could threaten guams tourism.58  guam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax to the eastern coast of australia has been present in guam since 1968, and rhinella marina cane toad was brought to the island in 1937. the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri to mainland asia microhyla pulchra to mainland asia polypedates braueri to taiwan eleutherodactylus planirostris to the caribbean fejervarya cancrivora guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan and fejervarya limnocharis to southeast asia have been in guam since 2003.59 many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asia  introduced feral pigs and deer over-hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of guams native plants and animals  threats to indigenous plantsedit  invading animal species are not the only threat to guams native flora tinangaja a virus affecting coconut palms was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of guams economy though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of Guam.60  during the past century the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan-tangan brush leucocephala much of guams foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947, the us military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905.61  in southern guam non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape although the colorful and impressive flame tree regia is found throughout the marianas the tree on guam has been largely decimated  wildfiresedit  guams grassland  wildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the islands humid climate most fires are caused by humans with 80 resulting from arson.62 poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats.63  aquatic preservesedit  having previously experienced extensive dredging tumon bay is now a marine wildlife preserve  efforts have been made to protect guams coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists.64 before adopting us environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests.6566 tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit bats.67  harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the green sea turtle mydas was harvested legally on guam before august 1978, when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act the hawksbill sea turtle imbricata has been on the endangered list since 1970. in an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on guam routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlings  whitespotted boxfish

6,000 miles from the us mainland with a very diverse student body including many students who come from backgrounds without traditional american education.71 an economic downturn in guam since the mid-1990s has compounded the problems in schools.72  before september 1997, the us department of defense partnered with guam board of Education.73 in september 1997, the dodea opened its own schools for children of military personnel.74 dodea schools which also serve children of some federal civilian employees had an attendance of 2,500 in 2000. dodea guam operates three elementarymiddle schools
