tropical storm hugo on september 11 at 1800 utc on september 13, hugo rapidly intensified and reached hurricane strength 1265 miles east of the leeward islands a low-pressure area to the south caused hugo to gradually turn to the west-northwest while the storm was slowly strengthening shortly after hurricane hugo began to rapidly intensify 24 hours after it was classified as a hurricane it had become a category 2 hurricane after this bout of rapid strengthening hugo began to rapidly deepen becoming a major hurricane early the next morning.1  after becoming a major hurricane and maintaining

governor carroll campbell said that the storm destroyed enough timber in south carolina to a home for every family in the state of west virginia an immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated to the point where they could not be used still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies so they were also downgraded into pulpwood leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased.35 in south carolina which bore the brunt of the storm the federal emergency management agency was slow in respondingcitation needed united states senator from south carolina fritz hollings referred to the agency as bunch of bureaucratic jackasses during a speech on the floor of the united states senate an investigation was launched which led to some reforms in fema procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during hurricane andrew the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the united states however fema was criticized severely in 2005 for its similarly insufficient response to hurricane Katrina.36  retirementedit  see also list of retired atlantic hurricane names  due to the extensive damage the name hugo was retired following this storm
