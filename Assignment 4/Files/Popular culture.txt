definitions of popular culture.18 the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much culture television dramatizations of jane austen is also culture is also defined as the culture that is over when we have decided what high culture is however many works straddle the boundaries eg william shakespeare and charles dickens  a third definition equates pop culture with culture and ideas this is seen as a commercial culture mass-produced for mass consumption by mass media.19 from a western european perspective this may be compared to american cultureclarification needed alternatively culture can be defined as an culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture neo-gramscian hegemony theory sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the of subordinate groups in society and the forces of operating in the interests of dominant groups in society a postmodernist approach to popular culture would longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture  storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the industrial revolution

provide a source of popular culture.22 this early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media eg in the form of jokes or urban legend with the widespread use of the internet from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth has become blurred  although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold moreover beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word-of-mouth and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves  entertainmentedit  television programsedit  main
