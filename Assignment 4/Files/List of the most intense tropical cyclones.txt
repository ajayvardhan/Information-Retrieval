list of the most intense tropical cyclones  a collage of ten of the strongest tropical cyclones  tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds however variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult in addition other impacts like rainfall storm surge area of wind damages and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on earth however although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds as each storms relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.1  in the most recent and reliable records most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900hPa or less occurred in the western north pacific ocean the strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide as measured by minimum central pressure was typhoon tip which reached a pressure of 870hPa on october 12, 1979.2 the following list is subdivided by basins data listed are provided by the official regional specialized meteorological centre unless otherwise noted on october 23, 2015, hurricane patricia attained the strongest 1-minute sustained winds on record at 215mph
