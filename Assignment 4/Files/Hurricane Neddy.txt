referencing one of the series writers  steve young a writer for the late show with david letterman was brought in as a freelance writer to write the episode.4 the writers wanted to explore what made flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does.4 the original idea came from george meyer who had also wanted an episode about flanders faith being tested.5 one of the key story points came from his friend jack handey a writer for saturday night live who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him but make very bad shoes likewise it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild flanders house but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.5  writer john swartzwelders animated likeness can be seen in a padded cell in reference to his reclusiveness  a caricature of john swartzwelder can be seen shutting the door of a room in calmwood mental Hospital.4 later in the episode during the scene where the townsfolk are welcoming ned back someone can be seen holding a sign that says john Swartzwelder.5 during the sequence where flanders yells at the town a man with a ponytail and wearing a white shirt who is a caricature of bob anderson can be seen.6  cultural referencesedit  the scene at the beginning of the episode in which the people of springfield mob the kwik-e-mart is based on the events of the 1992 los angeles riots.4 todd is wearing a butthole surfers shirt however the censors only allowed Surfers.4 jay sherman from the critic who had previously appeared in star is burns can also be seen in the mental hospital
