as the si unit of angular measure is the radian but it is mentioned in the si brochure as an accepted unit.4 because a full rotation equals 2 radians one degree is equivalent to radians  contents  1

six such chords complete the circle  the original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown one theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year.5 ancient astronomers noticed that the sun which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day some ancient calendars such as the persian calendar used 360 days for a year the use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers  another theory is that the babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system.67 the earliest trigonometry used by the babylonian astronomers and their greek successors was based on chords of a circle a chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity one sixtieth of this using their standard sexagesimal divisions was a degree  aristarchus of samos and hipparchus seem to have been among the first greek scientists to exploit babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically.89 timocharis aristarchus aristillus archimedes and hipparchus were the first greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes.10 eratosthenes used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts  the division of the circle into 360 parts also occurred in ancient india as evidenced in the Rigveda11  twelve spokes one wheel navels three  who can comprehend this  on it are placed together  three hundred and sixty like pegs  they shake not in the least  dirghatamas rigveda 1.164.48  another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is readily divisible 360 has 24 divisorsnote 1 making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors A072938 in the OEIS.1213 furthermore it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7.note 2 this property has many useful applications such as dividing the world into 24 time zones each of which is nominally 15 of longitude to correlate with the established 24-hour day convention  finally it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play according to that theory the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above  subdivisionsedit  for many practical purposes a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision when this is not the case as in astronomy or for geographic coordinates and longitude degree measurements may be written using decimal degrees with the degree symbol behind the decimals for example 40.1875.  alternatively the traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions can be used one degree is divided into 60 minutes arc and one minute into 60 seconds arc use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called dms notation these subdivisions also called the arcminute and arcsecond are respectively represented by a single and double prime for example 40.1875 40 11 15, or using quotation mark characters 40 11 15. additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds component  the older system of thirds fourths etc which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision was used by al-kashi and other ancient astronomers but is rarely used today these subdivisions were denotedcitation needed by writing the roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript 1I for a of arc 1II for a second 1III for a third 1IV for a fourth etc hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc and the word also refer to this systemcitation needed  alternative unitsedit  see also measuring angles  a chart to convert between degrees and radians  in most mathematical work beyond practical geometry angles are typically measured in radians rather than degrees this is for a variety of reasons for example the trigonometric functions have simpler and more properties when their arguments are expressed in radians these considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360. one complete turn is equal to 2 radians so 180 is equal to radians or equivalently the degree is a mathematical constant 1 180.  the turn revolution full circle full rotation cycle is used in technology and science one turn is equal to 360.  with the invention of the metric system based on powers of ten there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal 3 called grad or gon where the number in a right angle is equal to 100gon with 400gon in a full circle 109 gon although that idea was abandoned by napoleon grades continued to be used in several fields and many scientific calculators support them decigrades were used with french artillery sights in world war i  an angular mil which is most used in military applications has at least three specific variants ranging from 16,400 to 16,000. it is approximately equal to one milliradian 16,283. a mil measuring 16,000 of a revolution originated in the imperial russian army where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units this may be seen on a lining plane early device for aiming indirect fire
