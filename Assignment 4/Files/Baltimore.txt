after cecil calvert second lord Baltimore,19 of the irish house of lords and founding proprietor of the province of Maryland.2122 baltimore manor was the name of the estate in county longford on which the calvert family lived in Ireland.2223 baltimore is an anglicization of the irish name baile an t mhir meaning of the big house.22  before european settlementedit  the baltimore area had been inhabited by native americans since at least the 10th millennium bc when paleo-indians first settled in the region one paleo-indian site and several archaic period and woodland period archaeological sites have been identified in baltimore including four from the late woodland period.24 during the late woodland period the archaeological culture that is called the creek complex resided in the area from baltimore to the rappahannock river in Virginia.25  in the early 1600s, the immediate baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated if at all by native americans the baltimore county area northward was used as hunting grounds by the susquehannocks living in the lower susquehanna river valley who all of the upper tributaries of the chesapeake but from much contact with powhatan in the potomac region.26 pressured by the susquehannocks the piscataway tribe of algonquians stayed well south of the baltimore area and inhabited primarily the north bank of the potomac river in what is now charles county and southern prince georges county south of the fall Line.272829  colonial periodedit  european colonization of maryland began with the arrival of an english ship at st clements island in the potomac river europeans began to settle the area further north beginning to populate the area of baltimore County,30 with its original county seat known today as baltimore located on bush river within the present-day aberdeen proving Ground.313233 the colonists engaged in sporadic warfare with the susquhanna natives whose numbers dwindled from casualties and smallpox.30 in 1661 david jones claimed the area known today as jonestown on the east bank of the jones falls stream.34  the colonial general assembly of maryland created the port of baltimore at old whetstone point locust point in 1706 for the tobacco trade the town of baltimore on the west side of the jones falls was founded and laid out on july 30, 1729 with jonestown and fells point preexisting to the east the three settlements covering 60 acres became a commercial hub and in 1768 became the county seat.35  baltimore town in 1752, basin  baltimore grew swiftly in the 18th century as a granary for sugar-producing colonies in the caribbean the profit from sugar encouraged the cultivation of cane and the importation of food.36 baltimore established its public market system in 1763.37 lexington market founded in 1782, continues to be known as one of the oldest continuously operating public markets in the united states today.38 lexington market was also known to be a place for slave trading which occurred all over the downtown area and was advertised in the baltimore Sun.39 baltimore had the first post office system in the united states in 177440 and the first water company chartered in the united states water company 1792.4142  baltimore played a key part in events leading to and including the american revolution city leaders such as jonathan plowman jr moved the city to join the resistance to british taxes and merchants signed agreements to not trade with Britain.43 the second continental congress met in the henry fite house from december 1776 to february 1777, effectively making the city the capital of the united states during this period.44  antebellum periodedit  the town of baltimore jonestown and fells point were incorporated as the city of baltimore in 17961797. the city remained a part of surrounding baltimore county and continued to serve as its county seat from 17681851, after which it became an independent city.45  bombardment of fort mchenry by the british engraved by john bower  the battle of baltimore against the british in 1814 inspired the composition of the usas national anthem star-spangled banner and the construction of the battle monument which became the citys official emblem a distinctive local culture started to take shape and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed baltimore acquired its moniker monumental city after an 1827 visit to baltimore by president john quincy adams at an evening function adams gave the following toast the monumental citymay the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant.4748  the battle monument is the official emblem of the city of baltimore  baltimore pioneered the use of gas lighting in 1816 and its population grew rapidly in the following decades with concomitant development of culture and infrastructure the construction of the federally funded national road later became part of us route 40 and the private baltimore and ohio railroad o made baltimore a major shipping and manufacturing center by linking the city with major markets in the midwest by 1820 its population had reached 60,000, and its economy had shifted from

civil war and afteredit  maryland a slave state with abundant popular support for secession in some areas remained part of the union during the american civil war due in part to the unions strategic occupation of the city in 1861.5253 baltimore saw the first casualties of the war on april 19, 1861, when union soldiers en route from the president street station to camden yards clashed with a secessionist mob in the pratt street riot  in the midst of the long depression which followed the panic of 1873, the baltimore ohio railroad company attempted to lower its workers wages leading to strikes and riots in the city and beyond strikers clashed with the national guard leaving 10 dead and 25 wounded.54  20th century through 1968edit  the great baltimore fire of 1904, looking west from

estimated at 1904 dollars.55 as the city rebuilt during the next two years lessons learned from the fire led to improvements in firefighting equipment standards.56  the city grew in area by annexing new suburbs from the surrounding counties through 1918, when the city acquired portions of baltimore county and anne arundel County.57 a state constitutional amendment approved in 1948, required a special vote of the citizens in any proposed annexation area effectively preventing any future expansion of the citys boundaries.58 streetcars enabled the development of distant neighborhoods areas such as edmonson village whose residents could easily commute to work downtown.59  driven by migration from the deep south and by white suburbanization the relative size of the citys black population grew from 23.8 in 1950 to 46.4 in 1970.60 encouraged by real estate blockbusting techniques recently settled white areas rapidly became all-black neighborhoods in a rapid process which was nearly

effects of the riot can be seen on the streets of north avenue howard street gay street and pennsylvania avenue where long stretches of the streets remain barren.63 the city experienced challenges again in 1974 when teachers municipal workers and police officers conducted strikes.64  following the death of freddie gray in april 2015, the city experienced major protests and international media attention as well as a clash between local youth and police which resulted in a state of emergency declaration and curfew.65  baltimore has suffered from a high homicide rate for several decades peaking in 1993, and again in 2015.6667 these deaths have taken a severe toll especially on the local black community.68  development and promotionedit  by the beginning of the 1970s, baltimores downtown area known as the inner harbor had been neglected and was occupied by a collection of abandoned warehouses the nickname city came from a 1975 meeting of advertisers seeking to improve the citys reputation.6970 efforts to redevelop the area started with the construction of the maryland science center which opened in 1976, the baltimore world trade center and the baltimore convention center harborplace an urban retail and restaurant complex opened on the waterfront in 1980, followed by the national aquarium marylands largest tourist destination and the baltimore museum of industry
