conjunction between the debris and the space station was not detected until it was too late to perform a collision avoidance manoeuvre the crew prepared to evacuate the station by closing hatches between modules and boarding the soyuz spacecraft that was docked to provide emergency crew escape.3 the debris did not hit the station instead it passed by at 1638 utc and the crew were cleared to resume operations about five minutes later.3  extra-vehicular activityedit  mission  spacewalkers  start  end  duration  eva 1  yuri lonchakov  michael fincke  23 december 2008  0051  23 december 2008
