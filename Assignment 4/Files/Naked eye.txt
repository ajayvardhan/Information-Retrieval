practice of engaging in visual perception unaided by a magnifying or light-collecting optical instrument such as a telescope or microscope vision corrected to normal acuity using corrective lenses is considered in astronomy the naked eye may be used to observe events that can be viewed without equipment such as an astronomical conjunction the passage of a comet or a meteor shower sometimes some asteroids can be seen including 4 vesta sky lore and various tests demonstrate an impressive wealth of phenomena that can be seen with the unaided eye  contents  1 basic accuracies  2 naked eye in

eye in astronomyedit  a photographic approximation of a naked eye view of the night sky from a small rural town and a metropolitan area light pollution dramatically reduces the visibility of stars  the visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by light pollution even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects for most people these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach under such dark sky conditions the naked eye can see stars with an apparent magnitude up to under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent stars as faint as might be visible.4  the angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1 however some people have sharper vision than that there is anecdotal evidence that people had seen the galilean moons of jupiter before telescopes were invented.5 of similar magnitude uranus and vesta had most probably been seen but could not be recognized as planets because they appear so faint even at maximum brightness that their motion could not be detected uranus when discovered in 1781, was the first planet discovered using technology telescope rather than being spotted by the naked eye  theoretically in a typical dark sky the dark adapted human eye would see the about 5,600 stars brighter than while in perfect dark sky conditions about 45,000 stars brighter than might be visible.4 in practice the atmospheric extinction and dust reduces this number somewhat in the center of a city where the naked-eye limiting magnitude due to extreme amounts of light pollution can be or less as few as 200 to 500 stars may be visible colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses rods instead of cones to view fainter stars  the visibility of diffuse objects such as star clusters and galaxies is much more strongly affected by light pollution than is that of planets and stars under typical dark conditions only a few such objects are visible these include the pleiades h persei the andromeda galaxy the carina nebula the orion nebula omega centauri 47 tucanae the ptolemy cluster messier 7 near the tail of scorpius and the globular cluster M13 in hercules the triangulum galaxy is a difficult averted vision object and only visible at all if it is higher than 50 in the sky the globular clusters m 3 in canes venatici and m 92 in hercules are also visible with the naked eye under such conditions under really dark sky conditions however M33 is easy to see even in direct vision many other messier objects are also visible under such conditions.4 the most distant objects that have been seen by the naked eye are nearby bright galaxies such as centaurus A,7 bodes Galaxy,8910 sculptor Galaxy,10 and messier 83.11  five planets can be recognized as planets from earth with the naked eye mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn under typical dark sky conditions uranus can be seen as well with averted vision the sun and the moonthe remaining noticeable naked-eye objects of the solar systemare sometimes added to make seven during daylight only the moon and sun are obvious naked eye objects but in many cases venus can be spotted in daylight and in rarer cases jupiter close to sunset and sunrise bright stars like sirius or even canopus can be spotted with the naked eye as long as one knows the exact position in which to look historically the zenith of naked-eye astronomy was the work of tycho brahe he built an extensive observatory to make precise measurements of the heavens without any instruments for magnification in 1610, galileo galilei pointed a telescope towards the sky he immediately discovered the moons of jupiter and the phases of venus among other things  meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars such showers include the perseids august and the december geminids some 100 satellites per night the international space station and the milky way are other popular objects visible to the naked eye.12  space geodesy and navigationedit  many other things can be estimated without an instrument if an arm is stretched the span of the hand corresponds to an angle of 18 to 20. the distance of a person just covered up by the outstretched thumbnail is about 100 meters the vertical can be estimated to about 2 and in the northern hemisphere observing the pole star and using a protractor can give the observers geographic latitude up to 1 degree of accuracy  the babylonians mayans ancient egyptians ancient indians and chinese measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye  the length of a year and a month to 0.1 hour or to better than 1 minute  the 24 hours of a day and the equinoxes  the periods of the planets were calculated by mayan astronomers to within 5 to 10 minutes accuracy in the case of venus and mars  in a similar manner star occultations by the moon can be observed by using a digital clock an accuracy of 0.2 second is possible this represents only 200 meters at the moons distance of 385,000km.  small objects and mapsedit  observing a nearby small object without a magnifying glass or a microscope the size of the object depends on the viewing distance under normal lighting conditions source 1000 lumens at height 600700mm, viewing angle 35 degrees the angular size recognized by naked eye will be round 1 arc minute 160 degrees 0.0003 radians.1 at a viewing distance of 16 400mm, which is considered a normal reading distance in the usa the smallest object resolution will be 0.116mm. for inspection purposes laboratories use a viewing distance of 200250mm,citation needed which gives the smallest size of the object recognizable to the naked eye of 0.072mm55-75 micrometers the accuracy of a measurement ranges from 0.1 to 0.3mm and depends on the experience of the observer the latter figure is the usual positional accuracy of faint details in maps and technical plans  environmental pollutionedit  the milky way is visible over the very large telescope demonstrating clear atmosphere above paranal Observatory.13  a clean atmosphere is indicated by the fact that the milky way is visible comparing the zenith with the horizon shows how the quality is degraded depending on the amount of air pollution and dust the twinkling of a star is an indication of the turbulence of the air this is of importance in meteorology and for the of astronomy  light pollution is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its dome  literatureedit  davidson n sky phenomena a guide to
