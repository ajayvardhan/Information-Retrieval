that is capable of creating flood conditions a cloudburst can suddenly dump large amounts of water eg 25mm of precipitation corresponds to 25000 metric tonskm2 inch corresponds to 72,300short tons over one square mile however cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air resulting in sudden condensation at times a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst the term arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst resulting in rapid precipitation though this idea has since been disproven the term remains in use  contents  1 properties  2 record cloudbursts  3 cloudbursts in the indian subcontinent  3.1 bangladesh  3.2 india  3.3

responsible for flash flood creation  rapid precipitation from cumulonimbus clouds is possible due to the langmuir precipitation process in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly it is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation  record cloudburstsedit  duration  rainfall  location  date  1 minute  1.5 inches  basse-terre guadeloupe  26 november 1970  5.5 minutes  2.43 inches  port bell
