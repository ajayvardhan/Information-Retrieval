launches the first proton rocket was launched in 1965. modern versions of the launch system are still in use as of 2017, making it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight all protons are built at the khrunichev state research and production space center plant in moscow transported to the baikonur cosmodrome brought to the launch pad horizontally and raised into vertical position for launch.34  as with many soviet rockets the names of recurring payloads became associated with the proton the moniker originates from a series of similarly named scientific satellites which were among the rockets first payloads during the cold war it was designated the D-1D-1e or SL-12SL-13 by western intelligence agencies  launch capacity to low earth orbit is about 22.8 tonnes geostationary transfer capacity is about 6.3 tonnes commercial launches are marketed by international launch services the rocket is intended to be retired before 2030.7  in january 2017, the proton was temporarily grounded due to the manufacturer voronezh mechanical plant having substituted a heat-resistant alloy in the engines with a cheaper metal.89  contents  1 history  2 proton

designed to launch a 100-megaton larger thermonuclear weapon over a distance of 13,000km. it was hugely oversized for an icbm and was never deployed in such a capacity it was eventually used as a space launch vehicle it was the brainchild of vladimir chelomeis design bureau as a foil to sergei korolevs N1 rocket whose purpose was to send a two-man zond spacecraft around the moon korolev openly opposed proton and chelomeis other designs for their use of toxic propellants  a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972. proton did not complete its state trials until 1977, at which point it was judged to have a higher than 90 reliability  protons design was kept secret until 1986, with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of mir  proton launched the unmanned soviet circumlunar flights and was intended to have launched the first soviet circumlunar spaceflights before the united states flew the apollo 8 mission proton launched the salyut space stations the mir core segment and expansion modules and both the zarya and zvezda modules of the iss  proton also launches commercial satellites most of them being managed by international launch services the first ils proton launch was on 9 april 1996 with the launch of the ses astra 1F communications satellite.11  since 1994, proton has earned for the russian space industry and by 2011 this figure is expected to rise to  proton 8K82Kedit  main article proton-k  the index 8K82K version is now usually called k it is fuelled by very toxic unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.13 these are hypergolic fuels which ignite on contact avoiding the need for an ignition system and can be stored at ambient temperatures this avoids the need for components that are tolerant of low temperatures and allows the rocket to remain on the pad indefinitely launchers with such capability include the us titan ii titan iii and titan iv the chinese long march 2 rocket family and long march 4 rocket family the sovietukrainian tsyklon launchers the sovietrussian Kosmos-3 and Kosmos-3M launchers and the european ariane 1 to ariane 4 launchers in contrast cryogenic fuels need periodic replenishment as they boil off  the fourth stage has multiple variants depending on the mission the simplest blok d was used for interplanetary missions blok d had no guidance module depending on the probe to control flight three different blok dm versions DM2, and DM-2M were for high earth orbits the blok ddm were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank  the initial proton tests in 196566 only used the first two stages of the booster the complete four-stage vehicle being flown for the first time in 1967. when the soviet space station program began in 1971, protons began being flown with the blok d removed for use as a heavy-lift leo launcher  proton-k payloads including all of the soviet unions salyut space stations almost all mir modules the exception of the docking module which was launched on the united states space shuttle and the zarya and zvezda modules of the international space station it was intended to launch the manned tks spacecraft prior to the cancellation of that programme although a few non-manned flights of spacecraft was fulfilled also it was intended for proposed in the 1970s lks spaceplane that never realisedcitation needed  proton-medit  main article proton-m  proton-m part being rotated to vertical in the background the mobile service tower can be observed  the initial version of proton m could launch 33.2 tonnes into geostationary orbit or 5.5 tonnes into a geostationary transfer orbit it could place up to 22 tonnes in low earth orbit with a 51.6-degree inclination the orbit of the international space station  the proton ms improvements included lower stage modifications to reduce structural mass increase thrust and fully use propellants generally a briz-m meaning breeze storable propellant upper stage is used instead of the blok d or blok dm stage removing the need for multiple fuel supplies and oxygen top-off due to boiling the proton-m also flew with a blok-dm upper stage efforts were also made to reduce dependency on foreign ukrainian component suppliers  proton launch vehicles and briz-m upper stages are designed and built by khrunichev state research and production space center in moscow the majority owner of international launch services the center is home to all engineering assembly and test functions of proton production with the recent consolidation of the russian space enterprises khrunichev has direct oversight and control of up to 70 of all proton manufacturing from suppliers to manufacturers the consolidation directly supports khrunichevs ongoing efforts for vertical integration of proton production.14  an enhanced variant the phase iii proton-mbriz-m launch vehicle was flight proven on the russian federal dual mission of express AM-44 and express MD-1 in february 2009 and performed its first commercial launch in march 2010 with the echostar xiv satellite the proton-mbriz-m phase iii configuration provides 6150kg of gto performance an increase of 1150kg over the original proton-m briz-m while maintaining the fundamental design configuration  on 6 august 2012, the russian federal space agency lost a russian and an indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a proton-m due to technical difficulties with the last stage.15 on 2 july 2013, a proton-m launching three glonass navigation satellites experienced a failure reminiscent of the 1960s disasters shortly after liftoff when the booster crashed near LC-39 at baikonour ending a 30-year unbroken stretch without a first stage failure all future proton flights were suspended pending investigation.16 the accident was eventually determined to be caused by the rate gyro package having been installed upside-down due to the difficulty of installing the package incorrectly it was widely suspected that it had been done deliberately by a disgruntled or drunk worker at the khrunichev plant  on 15 may 2014, a proton-mbriz-m carrying an ekspress satellite suffered a third stage failure from a bad turbopump bearing debris fell in manchuria on 21 october another ekspress satellite was left in a useless orbit when the briz stage cut off 24 seconds too early  on 16 may 2015, a mexsat communications satellite failed to orbit due to another third stage malfunction the eighth proton failure since 2010.  khrunichev has initiated development of a set of phase iv enhancements in order to keep pace with market demands and the mass growth trends of commercial satellites the implementation of phase iv proton briz-m enhancements were completed in 2016. the payload mass performance for phase iv has been increased to 6320kg to a reference gto orbit with 1500ms of residual delta v to GSO.17  launchesedit  main article list of proton launches  future developmentsedit  significant upgrades were temporarily put on hold following announcement of the new angara launch vehicle the single largest upgrade was the kvrb stage this cryogenic stage would have greatly increased capacity the engine was developed successfully and the stage as a whole had progressed to hardware however as kvrb is noticeably larger than blok d the vehicles aerodynamics flight control software and possibly electronics would have to be reevaluated in addition the launch pad can supply existing protons with common hypergolic fuels from single sources the upper stages in particular are fed by common loading pipes running along the rocket switching to a stage with different fuels requires the addition of extra support articles switching to cryogens requires that such support articles top off the stage periodicallycitation needed  heavy variants of angara will be simpler and cheaper than proton like the atlas v rocket will not use hypergolic fuels instead it will use the same RP-1 fuel as that used on the soyuz rocket they will also be designed from the start to accept a kvtk stage and will already have a lox supply at the pad only a hydrogen supply will be called upon however delays in angara development mean that protons will continue to fly for some timecitation needed  see alsoedit  comparison of orbital launchers families  comparison of orbital
