provides medium- and long-distance intercity service in the contiguous united states founded in 1971 to take over most of the remaining us passenger rail services it is partially government funded yet operated and managed as a for-profit corporation.1  amtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 states and three canadian provinces operating more than 300 trains each day over 21,300 miles of track some track sections allow trains to run as fast as 150mph  in fiscal year 2016, amtrak served 31.3million passengers and had billion in revenue while employing more than 20,000 people.2 nearly two-thirds of passengers come from the 10 largest metropolitan areas 83 of passengers travel on routes shorter than 400 miles its headquarters is at union station in washington D.C.4  the name is a

railroads panama limited long-distance diesel streamliner train  in 1916 98 of all commercial intercity travelers in the united states moved by rail the remaining 2 moved by inland waterways passenger traffic on the railroads totaled 42 billion passenger-miles.6 passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains.7 thereafter patronage declined in the face of competition from buses air travel and the automobile new streamlined diesel-powered trains such as the pioneer zephyr were popular with the traveling public but could not reverse the trend.8 by 1940 railroads held just 67 percent of commercial passenger-miles in the united states in real terms passenger-miles had fallen by 40 since 1916, from 42 billion to 25 billion.6  traffic surged during world war ii aided by troop movements and gasoline rationing railroads market share surged to 74 in 1945, with a massive 94 billion passenger-miles.9 after the war railroads rejuvenated their overworked and neglected passenger fleets with fast and luxurious streamliners.10 these new trains brought only brief relief to the overall decline.11 even as postwar travel exploded passenger travels percentage of the overall market share fell to 46 by 1950, and 32 by 1957.6 the railroads had lost money on passenger service since the great depression but deficits reached million in 1957. for many railroads these losses threatened their financial viability.12  the causes of this decline were many and debated the national highway system and airports both funded by the government competed directly with the railroads who paid for their own infrastructure.13 progressive era rate regulation limited the railroads ability to turn a profit.14 railroads also faced antiquated work rules and inflexible relationships with trade unions to take one example workers continued to receive a days pay for 100-to-150-mile to 240km work days streamliners covered that in two hours.15  matters approached a crisis in the 1960s. passenger service route-miles fell from 107,000 miles in 1958 to 49,000 miles in 1970, the last full year of private operation.16 the diversion of most us postal service mail from passenger trains to trucks airplanes and freight trains in late 1967 deprived those trains of badly-needed revenue.17 in direct response the atchison topeka and santa fe railway filed to discontinue 33 of its remaining 39 trains ending almost all passenger service on one of the largest railroads in the country.18 the equipment the railroads had ordered after world war ii was now twenty years old worn out and in need of replacement.19  formationedit  see also list of railroads eligible to participate in the formation of amtrak  the denver and rio grande western railroads rio grande zephyr at denvers union station in april 1983  penn central railroads employee publication announcing the inauguration of amtrak on may 1, 1971. penn central amtrak routes are shown  as passenger service declined various proposals were brought forward to rescue it the 1961 doyle report proposed that the private railroads pool their services into a single body.20 similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968, but failed to attract support the federal government passed the high speed ground transportation act of 1965 to fund pilot programs in the northeast corridor but this did nothing to address passenger deficits in late 1969 multiple proposals emerged in congress including equipment subsidies route subsidies and lastly a corporation to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains matters were brought to a head on march 5, 1970, when the penn central the largest railroad in the northeast united states and teetering on bankruptcy filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trains.21  in october 1970, congress passed and president richard nixon signed into law the rail passenger service act proponents of the bill led by the national association of railroad passengers sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains they conceived the national railroad passenger corporation a private entity that would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains.22 the original working brand name for nrpc was railpax but shortly before the company started operating it was changed to Amtrak.23 there were several key provisions24  any railroad operating intercity passenger service could contract with the nrpc thereby joining the national system  participating railroads bought into the nrpc using a formula based on their recent intercity passenger losses the purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock in exchange the railroads received nrpc common stock  any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after may 1, 1971, except for those services chosen by the department of transportation as part of a system of service and paid for by nrpc using its federal funds  railroads that chose not to join the nrpc system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975 and thenceforth had to pursue the customary icc approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service  of the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970, only six declined to join Amtrak.25 nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived the nixon administration and many washington insiders viewed the nrpc as a politically expedient way for the president and congress to give passenger trains a hurrah as demanded by the public they expected amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned.26 after fortune magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974, louis w menk chairman of the burlington northern railroad remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle Amtrak.27 proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief but their view was that amtrak would soon support itself neither view has proved correct popular support has allowed amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasiblecitation needed  1970s the rainbow eraedit  a burlington northern emd F3 leads the north coast hiawatha into yakima washington in july 1971,

equipment was acquiring its own identity  amtrak began operations on may 1, 1971.28 amtrak received no rail tracks or rights-of-way at its inception all amtraks routes were continuations of prior service although amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network of the 364 trains operated previously amtrak only continued 182. on trains that continued to the extent possible schedules were retained with only minor changes from the official guide of the railways and under the same namescitation needed several major corridors became freight-only including the ex-new york central railroads

eastbound travel on the james whitcomb riley between chicago and newport newscitation needed  amtrak inherited problems with train stations most notably deferred maintenance and redundant facilities resulting from competing companies that served the same areas on the day it started amtrak was given the responsibility of rerouting passenger trains from the seven train terminals in chicago dearborn grand central randolph chicago northwestern terminal central and union into just one union station in new york city amtrak had to pay to maintain both penn station and grand central terminal because of the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate new york into penn station a problem not rectified until the building of the empire connection in 1991.citation needed amtrak would abandon numerous large stations whose upkeep could no longer be justified on the other hand the creation of the los angelesseattle coast starlight from three formerly separate trains was an immediate successcitation needed  classic amtrak logo displayed at the oakland jack london square station in oakland california  amtraks early years are often called the rainbow era which refers to the ad hoc arrangement of the rolling stock and locomotives from a pool of equipment acquired by amtrak at its formation that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners this rolling stock which for the most part still bore the pre-amtrak colors and logos formed the multi-colored consists of early amtrak trains by mid-1971, amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased including 286 second-hand locomotives the emd e and f types 30 GG1 electric locomotives and 1,290 passenger cars and continued leasing even more motive power by 1975, the official amtrak color scheme was painted on most amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearing.29  amtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire rights-of-way following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s, including penn central which owned and operated the northeast corridor congress passed the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of 1976.30 a large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of conrail but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the nec not already owned by state authorities to amtrak amtrak acquired the majority of the nec on april 1, 1976.31 portion in massachusetts is owned by the commonwealth and managed by amtrak the route from new haven to new rochelle is owned by the metropolitan transportation authority and the connecticut department of transportation as the new haven linecitation needed this main line became amtraks asset and helped the railroad generate revenue while the nec ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming as a result amtraks federal subsidy was increased dramatically in subsequent years other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to amtrakcitation needed  in its first decade amtrak fell far short of financial independence which continues today but it did find modest success rebuilding trade outside factors discouraged competing transport such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel and strikes which disrupted airline operations investments in amtraks track equipment and information also made amtrak more relevant to americas transportation needs.3233 amtraks

and retired southern railway head william graham claytor jr became president claytor came out of retirement to lead amtrak after the disastrous financial results during the carter administration despite frequent clashes with the reagan administration over funding claytor enjoyed a good relationship with john h riley the head of the federal railroad administration and with members of congress limited funding led claytor to use short-term debt to fund operations.36  building on mechanical developments in the 1970s, high speed washington-new york metroliner service was improved with new equipment and faster schedules travel time between new york and washington dc was reduced to under 3 hours.37 according to the 1980 amtrak annual report a converted 12-car set saved the company approximately a year in fuel maintenance and yard support costs amtrak completed the head-end power conversion program in 1982. demand for passenger rail service resulted in the creation of five new state-supported routes in california illinois missouri oregon and pennsylvania for a total of 15 state-supported routes across the nation  ridership stagnated at roughly 20million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000.3438 thomas downs succeeded claytor in 1993. amtraks stated goal remained self-sufficiency by this time however amtrak had a large overhang of debt from years of underfunding and in the mid-1990s, amtrak suffered through a serious cash crunch under downs congress included a provision in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 that resulted in amtrak receiving a tax refund that resolved their cash crisis.39 however congress also instituted a to financial self-sufficiency excluding railroad retirement tax act payments.40  george warrington became president in 1998 with a mandate to make amtrak financially self-sufficient passengers became and there were expansions into express freight work but the financial plans failed amtraks inroads in express freight delivery created additional friction with competing freight operators including the trucking industry delivery was delayed of much anticipated high-speed trainsets for the improved

ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the nec and rises in automobile fuel costs the inauguration of the high-speed acela express in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains however through the late 1990s and very early 21st century amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even by 2002, it was clear that amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency but congress continued to authorize funding and released amtrak from the requirement.41 in early 2002 david l gunn replaced warrington as president in a departure from his predecessors promises to make amtrak self-sufficient in the short term gunn argued that no form of passenger transportation in the united states is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured.42 highways airports and air traffic control all require large government expenditures to build and operate coming from the highway trust fund and aviation trust fund paid for by user fees highway fuel and road taxes and in the case of the general fund from general taxation.43 gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenance.44  a plan by the bush administration privatize parts of the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership provoked disagreement within amtraks board of directors late in 2005 gunn was fired.45 gunns replacement alexander kummant was committed to operating a national rail network and like gunn opposed the notion of putting the northeast corridor under separate ownership.46 he said that shedding the systems long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks and that amtraks abandonment of these routes would be irreversible in late 2006, amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of for ten years.46 in early 2007, amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year its highest amount since its founding in 1970. politico noted a key problem rail system chronically operates in the red a pattern has emerged congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the white house and appropriates enough funds to keep amtrak from plunging into insolvency but amtrak advocates say that is not enough to fix the systems woes  joseph h boardman replaced kummant as president and ceo in late 2008.48 in 2011, amtrak announced its intention to build a small segment of a high-speed rail corridor from penn station in nyc under the hudson river in new tunnels and double-tracking the line to newark nj called the gateway project estimated to cost after years of almost revolving-door ceos at amtrak in december 2013, boardman was named of the year by railway age magazine which noted that with over five years in the job he is the second-longest serving head of amtrak since it was formed more than 40 years ago.52  from may 2011 to may 2012, amtrak celebrated its 40th anniversary with festivities across the country that started on national train day 7, 2011. a commemorative book entitled amtrak an american story was published and a documentary was created four commemorative heritage units a 40th anniversary exhibit train toured the country the exhibit train visited 45 communities and welcomed

the amtrak board of directors of his decision the previous week on august 19, 2016, the amtrak board of directors named former norfolk southern railway president ceo charles moorman as boardmans successor with an effective date of september 1, 2016.58 during his term moorman took no salary59 and said that he saw his role as one of a transitional ceo who would reorganize amtrak before turning it over to new leadership.60  in may and june 2017, following several service disruptions within pennsylvania station and the east river tunnels the train service announced an expedited schedule for maintenance and repairs of infrastructure which involves the complete shutdown of multiple tracks at a time.61 amtrak has faced criticism from commuters as well as politicians for these incidents prompting responses from figures such as new jersey governor chris christie and new york governor andrew cuomo the repairs are expected to take place in summer 2017, affecting the long island rail road and new jersey transit trains during all hours who have planned additional or modified services.6263  in june 2017, it was announced that former delta and northwest airlines ceo richard anderson

corridor state-supported short haul service outside the northeast corridor and long-distance service known within amtrak as the national network amtrak receives federal funding for the vast majority of its operations including the central spine of the northeast corridor between boston and washington dc as well as for its national long distance routes in addition to the federally funded routes amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the northeast corridor some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it in addition to its inter-city services amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including marc in maryland shore line east in connecticut and metrolink in california  service on the northeast corridor between boston and washington dc as well as between philadelphia and harrisburg is powered by overhead electric wires for the rest of the system diesel locomotives are used routes vary widely in frequency of service from three-days-a-week trains on the sunset limited to weekday service several times per hour on the northeast corridor amtrak also operates a captive bus service thruway motorcoach which provides connections to train routes.66  the most popular and heavily used services are those running on the nec including the acela express and northeast regional the nec runs from boston to washington dc via new york city and philadelphia some services continue into virginia the nec services accounted for 11.4million of amtraks 31.6million passengers in fiscal year 2013.67 outside the nec the most popular services are the short-haul corridors in california these include the pacific surfliner capitol corridor and san joaquin supplemented by an extensive network of connecting buses together the california corridor trains accounted for a combined 5,627,000 passengers in fiscal year 2013.67 other popular corridors include the empire service which operates between new york city and toronto ontario via albany and buffalo new york and carried about 1,538,000 passengers in 2015, and the keystone service from new york city to harrisburg

outside the northeast corridor and stretches of track in southern california and michigan most amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to amtrak trains some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track the railroads dispatching practices were investigated in 2008,81 resulting in stricter laws about train priority subsequently amtraks overall on-time performance went up from 74.7 in fiscal 2008 to 84.7 in 2009, with long-distance trains and others outside the nec seeing the greatest benefit the missouri river runner jumped from 11 to 95, becoming one of amtraks best performers the texas eagle went from 22.4 to 96.7, and the california zephyr with a 5 on-time record in 2008, went up to 78.3.82 this improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988, meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic.83  ridershipedit  annual ridership by fiscal year 19712012  amtrak carried 15,848,327 passengers in 1972, its first full year of operation.84 ridership peaked in 2016 with a record

labor issuesedit  in the modern era amtrak faces a number of important labor issues in the area of pension funding because of limitations originally imposed by congress most amtrak workers were traditionally classified as employees and contributions to the railroad retirement system have been made for those employees however because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work some critics such as the national association of railroad passengers maintain that amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as US150 millionyear.130  in recent times efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues in 1997 congress released amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation outside its unions opening the door to privatization.131 since that time many of amtraks employees have been working without a contract the most recent contract signed in 1999, was mainly retroactive  because of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job as of 2009update amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with plus it has 24 separate contracts with those unions.132 this makes it difficult to make substantial changes in contrast to a situation where one union negotiates with one employer former amtrak president kummant followed a cooperative posture with amtraks trade unions ruling out plans to privatize large parts of amtraks unionized workforce.133  public fundingedit  amtrak receives annual appropriations from federal and state governments to supplement operating and capital programs  total federal grant appropriations per year  fy 2009  fy 2010  fy 2011  fy 2012  fy 2013134  fy 2014  fy 2015135         history of fundingedit  1970s to 1990sedit  amtrak commenced operations in 1971 with in direct federal aid in federally insured loans and a somewhat larger private contribution.136 officials expected that amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of during the reagan administration appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of almost none of which were capital appropriations.138 in the late 1980s and early 1990s, congress continued the reductionist trend even while amtrak expenses held steady or rose amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs and by 1995 amtrak was on the brink of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts.139 in response in 1997 congress authorized for amtrak over the next five years largely to complete the acela capital project on the condition that amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation.140 while amtrak made financial improvements during this periodcitation needed it did not achieve self-sufficiency.141  2000sedit  amtraks piedmont near charlotte north carolina with a state-owned locomotive this route is run under a partnership with the north carolina department of transportation 2003  amtrak cascades service with tilting talgo trainsets in seattle washington 2006  in 2004, a stalemate in federal support of amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance in fiscal 2004 and 2005, congress appropriated about for amtrak more than president george w bush had requested however the companys board requested through fiscal 2006, the majority of which would be used to bring infrastructure rolling stock and motive power back to a state of good repair in congressional testimony the dot inspector general confirmed that amtrak would need at least to in fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo in 2006, amtrak received just under with the condition that amtrak would reduce not eliminate food and sleeper service losses thus dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers only auto train and empire builder services continue regular made-on-board meal service in 2010 the senate approved a bill to provide to amtrak but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a appropriation.141  state governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid several states have entered into operating partnerships with amtrak notably california pennsylvania illinois michigan oregon missouri washington north carolina oklahoma texas wisconsin vermont maine and new york as well as the canadian province of british columbia which provides some of the resources for the operation of the cascades route  with the dramatic rise in gasoline prices during 200708, amtrak has seen record ridership.142 capping a steady five-year increase in ridership overall regional lines saw 12 year-over-year growth in may 2008.143 in october 2007, the senate passed S-294, passenger rail improvement and investment act of 2007 sponsored by senators frank lautenberg and trent lott despite a veto threat by president bush a similar bill passed the house on june 11, 2008, with a veto-proof margin the final bill spurred on by the september 12 metrolink collision in california and retitled rail safety improvement act of 2008, was signed into law by president bush on october 16, 2008. the bill appropriates a year in amtrak funding through 2013.145  2010sedit  amtrak points out that in 2010, its farebox recovery of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares was 79, the highest reported for any us passenger railroad.67  amtrak has argued that it needs to increase capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years however despite an initial request for more than billion in funding for the year the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations dropping to under billion for the first time in several years.134 amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the northeast corridor included over 200 bridges most dating to the 19th century tunnels under baltimore dating to the american civil war era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost billion to repair than triple amtraks total annual budget.146 amtraks budget is only allocated on a yearly basis and it has been argued by joseph vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible.147pageneeded  in fiscal year 2011, the us congress granted amtrak million for operating and million for capital programs.148  controversyedit  government aid to amtrak was controversial from the beginning the formation of amtrak in 1971 was criticized as a bailout serving corporate rail interests and union railroaders not the traveling public critics have asserted that amtrak has proven incapable of operating as a business and that it does not provide valuable transportation services meriting public support,147pageneeded a money-burning machine.149 many argued that subsidies should be ended national rail service terminated and the nec turned over to private interests fund a nostalgia limited is not in the public interest.150 critics also question amtraks energy efficiency,151 though the us department of energy considers amtrak among the most energy-efficient forms of transportation.152  the rail passenger service act of 1970, which established amtrak specifically states that corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the united states Government.153 then common stock was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment these shares convey almost no benefits,154 but their current holders155 declined a 2002 buy-out offer by amtrak there are currently 109,396,994 shares of preferred stock at a par value of per share all held by the us government there are currently 9,385,694 shares of common stock with a par value of per share held by four other
