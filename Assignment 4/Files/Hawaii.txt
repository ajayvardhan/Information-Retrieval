name of its largest island hawaii a common hawaiian explanation of the name of hawaii is that was named for hawaiiloa a legendary figure from hawaiian myth he is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.1213  the hawaiian language word hawaii is very similar to proto-polynesian with the reconstructed meaning cognates of hawaii are found in other polynesian languages including mori rarotongan and samoan according to linguists pukui and Elbert,15 in polynesia hawaii or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home but in hawaii the name has no meaning.16  spelling of state name  a somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the constitution of the state of hawaii added hawaiian as a second official state language.17 the title of the state constitution is the constitution of the state of hawaii articlexv Section1 of the constitution uses the state of Hawaii.18 diacritics were not used because the document drafted in 1949,19 predates the use of the okina and the kahak in modern hawaiian orthography the exact spelling of the states name in the hawaiian language is hawaiib in the hawaii admission act that granted hawaiian statehood the federal government recognized hawaii as the official state name official government publications department and office titles and the seal of hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length.20 in contrast the national and state parks services the university of hawaii and some private enterprises implement these symbols no precedent for changes to us state names exists since the adoption of the united states constitution in 1789. however the constitution of massachusetts formally changed the province of massachusetts bay to the commonwealth of massachusetts in 1780, and in 1819 the territory of arkansaw was created but was later admitted to statehood as the state of arkansas  geography and environment  main article hawaiian islands  there

hawaii is the southernmost us state and the second westernmost after alaska hawaii along with alaska does not border any other us state it is the only us state that is not geographically located in north america the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivable  in addition to the eight main islands the state has many smaller islands and islets kaula is a small island near niihau the northwest hawaiian islands is a group of nine small older islands to the northwest of kauai that extend from nihoa to kure atoll these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets such as molokini which are either volcanic marine sedimentary or erosional in origin.32  hawaiis tallest mountain mauna kea is 13,796ft above mean sea level33 it is taller than mount everest if measured from the base of the mountain which lies on the floor of the pacific ocean and rises about 33,500 feet  geology  main article hawaii hotspot  phoehoe or smooth lava spills into the pacific ocean forming new rock off the coast of the island of hawaii  the hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the hawaii hotspot the process is continuing to build islands the tectonic plate beneath much of the pacific ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary slowly creating new volcanoes because of the hotspots location all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of hawaii island the newest volcano lihi seamount is located south of the coast of hawaii island  the last volcanic eruption outside hawaii island occurred at haleakal on maui before the late 18thcentury, possibly hundreds of years earlier.35 in 1790, klauea exploded it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the united States.36 up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on klauea were killed by the eruption.37 volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features hawaii island has the third-highest point among the worlds islands.38  on the flanks of the volcanoes slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis particularly in 1868 and 1975.39 steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes.4041  flora and fauna  see also endemism in the hawaiian islands and list of invasive plant species in hawaii  corvus hawaiiensis the endemic hawaiian crow is extinct in the wild  because the islands of hawaii are distant from other land habitats life is thought to have arrived there by wind waves by ocean currents and wings birds insects and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers this isolation in combination with the diverse environment extreme altitudes tropical climates and arid shorelines produced an array of endemic flora and fauna hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other us state.42 one endemic plant brighamia now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct.43 the two species of brighamiab rockii and b insignisare represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants to ensure these plants set seed biologists rappel down 3,000-foot cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.44  the extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10million years a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there the islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field on a single island the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall to wet tropical on the slopes environments range from tropical rainforest than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters per year through a temperate climate to alpine conditions with a cold dry climate the rainy climate impacts soil development which largely determines ground permeability affecting the distribution of streams and wetlandscitation needed  protected areas  french frigate shoals located in the northwestern hawaiian islands is protected as part of the papahnaumokukea marine national monument  several areas in hawaii are under the protection of the national park Service.45 hawaii has two national parks haleakal national park located near kula on the island of maui which features the dormant volcano haleakal that formed east maui and hawaii volcanoes national park in the southeast region of the hawaii island which includes the active volcano klauea and its rift zones  there are three national historical parks kalaupapa national historical park in kalaupapa molokai the site of a former leper colony kaloko-honokhau national historical park in kailua-kona on hawaii island and puuhonua o hnaunau national historical park an ancient place of refuge on hawaii islands west coast other areas under the control of the national park service include ala kahakai national historic trail on hawaii island and the uss arizona memorial at pearl harbor on oahu  the papahnaumokukea marine national monument was proclaimed by president george w bush on june 15, 2006. the monument covers roughly 140,000 square miles of reefs atolls and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles offshore in the pacific oceanan area larger than all of the national parks in the us combined.46  climate  see also list of hawaii tornadoes and climate of hawaii  a true-color satellite view of hawaii shows that most of the vegetation on the islands grows on the northeast sides which face the wind the silver glow around the southwest of the islands is the result of calmer waters.47  hawaiis climate is typical for the tropics although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east summer highs usually reach around 88F during the day with the temperature reaching a low of 75F at night winter day temperatures are usually around 83F at low elevation they seldom dip below 65F at night snow not usually associated with the tropics falls at 13,800 feet on mauna kea and mauna loa on hawaii island in some winter months snow rarely falls on haleakal mount waialeale on kauai has the second-highest average annual rainfall on earth about 460 inches per year most of hawaii experiences only two seasons the dry season runs from may to october and the wet season is from october to April.48  the warmest temperature recorded in the state in pahala on april 27, 1931, is 100F making it tied with alaska as the lowest record high temperature observed in a us state.49 hawaiis record low temperature is 12F observed in May1979 on the summit of mauna kea hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero fahrenheit temperatures.49  climates vary considerably on each island they can be divided into windward and leeward and kona respectively areas based upon location

government  republic of hawaii  modern-day hawaii  us territory  state of hawaii  hawaii portal  v  t  e  hawaii is one of four us statesapart from the original thirteen along with the vermont republic the republic of texas and the california republic were independent nations prior to statehood along with texas hawaii had formal international diplomatic recognition as a nation.50  the kingdom of hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident american and european capitalists and landholders hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until august 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the united states hawaii was admitted as a us state on august 21, 1959.51  first human settlement ancient hawaii  main article ancient hawaii  based on archaeological evidence the earliest habitation of the hawaiian islands dates to around 300 ce probably by polynesian settlers from the marquesas islands a second wave of migration from raiatea and bora bora took place in the 11th century the date of the human discovery and habitation of the hawaiian islands is the subject of academic debate.52 some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from tahiti around 1000 ce who introduced a new line of high chiefs the kapu system the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiaucitation needed this later immigration is detailed in hawaiian mythology about paao other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of tahitian settlers and that paao must be regarded as a mythcitation needed  the history of the islands is marked by a slow steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms which grew to encompass whole islands local chiefs called alii ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals ancient hawaii was a caste-based society much like that of hindus in India.53  european arrival  kalanipuu king of hawaii brings presents to captain cook  it is possible that spanish explorers arrived in the hawaiian islands in the 16th century200 years before captain james cooks first documented visit in 1778. ruy lpez de villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left acapulco in 1542 bound for the philippines with a spanish sailor named juan gaetano aboard as pilot depending on the interpretation gaetanos reports describe an encounter with either hawaii or the marshall Islands.5455bettersourceneeded if de villalobos crew spotted hawaii gaetano would be considered the first european to see the islands some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility.5657  spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as hawaii but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands in this manuscript the island of maui is named la desgraciada unfortunate island and what appears to be hawaii island is named la mesa table islands resembling kahoolawe lanai and molokai are named los monjes Monks.58 for two-and-a-half centuries spanish galleons crossed the pacific from mexico along a route that passed south of hawaii on their way to manila the exact route was kept secret to protect the spanish trade monopoly against competing powers  the 1778 arrival of british explorer james cook was the first documented contact by a european explorer with hawaii cook named the archipelago as the sandwich islands in honor of his sponsor john montagu 4th earl of sandwich cook published the islands location and rendered the native name as owyhee this spelling lives on in owyhee county idaho it was named after three native hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area the owyhee mountains were also named for them.59  king kamehameha receiving otto von kotzebues russian naval expedition drawing by louis choris in 1816.  cook visited the hawaiian islands twice as he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as cook took temple idols and fencing as and a minor chief and his men took a ships boat cook abducted the king of hawaii island kalanipuu and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of cooks boat this tactic had worked in tahiti and other islands.61 instead kalanipuus supporters fought back killing cook and four marines as cooks party retreated along the beach to their ship they departed without the ships boat  after cooks visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages the hawaiian islands attracted many european visitors explorers traders and eventually whalers who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies early british influence can be seen in the design of the flag of hawaii which bears the union jack in the top-left corner these visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands causing the hawaiian population to drop precipitously.62 native hawaiians had no resistance to eurasian diseases such as influenza smallpox and measles by 1820, disease famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the native hawaiian population.63 during the 1850s, measles killed a fifth of hawaiis people.64  historical records indicated the earliest chinese immigrants to hawaii originated from guangdong province a few sailors arrived in 1778 with captain cooks journey and more arrived in 1789 with an american trader who settled in hawaii in the late 18th century it appears that leprosy was introduced by chinese workers by 1830 as with the other new infectious diseases it proved damaging to the hawaiianscitation needed  kingdom of hawaii  main article kingdom of hawaii  house of kamehameha  kamehameha i conquered the hawaiian islands and established a unified monarchy across the archipelago  during the 1780s and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power after a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as king kamehameha the great he established the house of kamehameha a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.65  after kamehameha ii inherited the throne in 1819, american protestant missionaries to hawaii converted many hawaiians to christianity they used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people.6667 during the reign of king kamehameha iii hawaii turned into a christian monarchy with the signing of the 1840 Constitution.68 hiram bingham i a prominent protestant missionary was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive american subjects.69 catholic and mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom but they converted a minority of the native hawaiian population.707172 missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at kalaupapa on molokai which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century the best known were father damien and mother marianne cope both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as roman catholic saints  the death of the bachelor king kamehameha vwho did not name an heirresulted in the popular election of lunalilo over kalkaua lunalilo died the next year also without naming an heir in

other regions with desirable weather throughout the year such as areas of california arizona and florida hawaiis residents can be considered to be subject to a tax this situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well the situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in hawaii a us trade law known as the jones act or the merchant marine act of 1920. this trade regulation prohibits any foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american portsa practice known as cabotage most consumer goods in the united states are manufactured by outsourced labor in east asia then transported by container ships to ports on the us mainland and hawaii also receives the same goods being located in the central pacific ocean right between major pacific shipping lanes it would be very economical to unload hawaiian-bound goods in honolulu before continuing on to the mainland however this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two american ports because most large cargo ships operate under foreign of convenience such as liberia vanuatu or papua new guinea allowing them to avoid the more stringent and thus more costly regulations of developed nations ports the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the jones act instead those cargo ships must proceed directly to the west coast where distributors break bulk and transport the hawaiian-bound asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by us-flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50. this highly inefficient system of shipping hawaiis consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average hawaiian citizen and makes the cost of living in hawaii much much higher than it would otherwise be.156157  hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the jones act this law makes hawaii less competitive than west coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like japan even though prices for asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because hawaii is much closer than mainland states to Asia.158159  culture  main article culture of the native hawaiians  the aboriginal culture of hawaii is polynesian hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast
