the earliest club the current hurricanes link their past to are the saarlouis hurrikans a team from saarlouis which was formed in 1982. this team played in the 2nd bundesliga from 1983 onwards but relocated to dillingen in 1984 and became the dillingen Hurrikanes.12  in between in 1983, another american football club was formed the saarlouis wlfe but never reached above local league level and folded in 1989, with its players joining the dillingen hurrikanes meanwhile the dillingen hurrikanes continued playing in the 2nd bundesliga until 1986, when its division folded and the club had to step a level down in 1989, after the wlfe had folded the club was renamed dillingen Steelhawks.1  also in 1989, the saarbrcken ghostbusters were formed as another american football club in the Saarland.1  the dillingen steelhawks continued competitive league football in the tier-three regionalliga at times alongside the ghostbusters the team remained at local level until 1993, when it won promotion to the central division of the 2nd bundesliga at this level it lasted for only one season but bounced back in 1995 and returned to the second level for 1996.2  the saarbrcken ghostbusters were renamed saarbrcken wlfe in 1991 but were unable to rise above the third tier of the league system by the end of 1996, both the saarbrcken and the dillingen club had come to the conclusion that as individual clubs no further improvement was possible and agreed on a merger.1  saarland hurricanesedit  the team now as the saarland hurricanes and still playing in the 2nd bundesliga had some instant success winning its division in 1997 and 2000. in 1997, the stuttgart scorpions proved too strong winning both promotionrelegation matches and barring the hurricanes from the elite league in its second attempt in 2000, the side overcame the landsberg express in the first game of the promotion round 40-22. landsberg did not field in the second game and the hurricanes were qualified for the german football league for the 2001 season.2  the saarland hurricanes were not a strong side in their following time in the gfl only winning a game each in three of their first four seasons however they still managed to finish fifth and away from the relegation rank the 2005 season was to be the clubs best finishing with a balanced win-loss record and qualifying for the post season for the first time it then lost to the braunschweig lions 17-32 in the quarter finals and was eliminated.2  after this one-off success the club quickly declined again and finished last in its division in 2007. having to enter the relegation round the team lost both games to the munich cowboys and found itself back in the 2nd Bundesliga.2  in this league soon to be renamed german football league 2, the saarland hurricanes took two seasons to rebuild before another division title in 2010 meant direct promotion back to the gfl courtesy to a league expansion.2 the club was only able to win two of their regular season games in 2011 and finished second-last in the gfl south avoiding relegation because of an even worse performance by the plattling black Hawks.3  in 2012, the club came seventh in the southern division of the gfl and thereby failed to qualify for the play-off it improved to fifth place in 2013 but again did not qualify for the play-offs the 2014 season saw another sixth-place finish and the club once again missed out on the play-offs it finished fourth in the gfl south in 2015 and qualified for the play-offs for the second time in the clubs history losing to the new yorker
