blows in the sahara palestine jordan syria and the deserts of arabian peninsula its temperature may exceed 54C and the humidity may fall below 10. alternative spellings include samoon samun simoun and simoon another name used for this wind is samiel samyeli simoom winds have an alternative type occurring in the region of central asia known as  the name means wind and is given because the sudden onset of simoom may also cause heat stroke this is attributed to the fact that the hot wind brings more heat to the body than can be disposed of by the evaporation of perspiration  the nuttall encyclopdia described the simoom  the storm moves in cyclone form carrying clouds of dust and sand and produces on humans and animals a suffocating effect.1  a 19th-century account of simoom in egypt reads  egypt is also subject particularly during the spring and summer to the hot wind called the which is still more oppressive than the khamasin winds but of much shorter duration seldom lasting longer than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes it generally proceeds from the south-east or south-south-east and carries with it clouds of dust and sand.2  contents  1 in north america  2

local historian walker tompkins wrote that during the morning the temperature hovered around the normal 24 to 27C to 81F, but around 1 pm strong super hot winds filled with dust began to blow from the direction of the santa ynez mountains to the north by 2 pm the temperature supposedly reached 56C this temperature was said to have been recorded by an official us coastal survey vessel that was operating in the waters just offshore in the santa barbara channel at 5 pm the temperature had reportedly dropped to 50C and by 7 pm the temperature was back to a normal 25C tompkins provided a supposed quote from a us government report saying rabbits and cattle died on their feet fruit fell from trees to the ground scorched on the windward side all vegetable gardens were ruined a fisherman in a rowboat made it to the goleta sandspit with his face and arms blistered as if he had been exposed to a blast furnace.3 also according to tompkins local inhabitants were saved from the heat by seeking shelter in the thick adobe walled houses that were the standard construction at the time  however experts contest this account ucsb professor joel michaelsen for instance said i have never found any outside source to validate tompkins story and i am highly skeptical of its veracity i dont doubt that strong hot dry downslope winds could kick up lots of dust and produce very high temperatures but in the 110 f 115 f range at most the 133 f just isnt physically reasonable as it would require the creation of an extremely hot air mass somewhere to the northeast last mondays weather was a very good strong example of the sort of conditions that would produce such a heat wave and our temperatures topped out at least 20 degrees below tompkins figure stronger winds could have increased the heating a bit but not nearly that much add to all that meteorologically-based skepticism tompkins well-known tendency to mix liberal doses of fiction into his and i think you have a strong case for discounting this one.4  meteorologist christopher c burt writing on weather underground says about the alleged incident is no record of who made this measurement or exactly where it was made in santa barbara some later sources say it was made on a us coastal geo-survey vessel if that is the case then the temperature is not possible since the waters off santa barbara in june are never warmer than about 70F and any wind blowing over the ocean would have its temperature modified by the cool water no matter how hot the air this report is singular and there is physical evidence crops and dead animals that something amazing happened here this day but the temperature record is impossible to validate.5  figurative use of the wordedit  edgar allan poes short story found in a bottle features a storm off the coast of java wherein appearance warranted me protagonist-narrator in apprehending a simoom  in the political essay thomas carlyle argues that even the poorest of men who have resigned themselves to misery and toil cannot resign themselves to injustice because they retain an innate sense that a higher justice must govern the world itself the hopelessness of resistance has doubtless a composing effect against inanimate simooms and much other infliction of the like sort we have found it suffice to produce complete composure yet one would say a permanent injustice even from an infinite power would prove unendurable by men  walden by henry david thoreau references a simoom he uses it to describe his urge to escape something most unwanted is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted it is human it is divine carrion if i knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for
