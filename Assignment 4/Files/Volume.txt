volume  for other uses see volume  a measuring cup can be used to measure volumes of liquids this cup measures volume in units of cups fluid ounces and millilitres  volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface for example the space that a substance liquid gas or plasma or shape occupies or contains.1 volume is often quantified numerically using the si derived unit the cubic metre the volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container i e the amount of fluid or liquid that the container could hold rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces  three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes volumes of some simple shapes such as regular straight-edged and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shapes boundary where a variance in shape and volume occurs such as those that exist between different human beings these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the body volume index one-dimensional figures as lines and two-dimensional shapes as squares are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space  the volume of a solid regularly or irregularly shaped can be determined by fluid displacement displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas the combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances however sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additive.2  in differential geometry volume is expressed by means of the volume form and is an important global riemannian invariant in thermodynamics volume

one centimetre in length  in the international system of units the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre the metric system also includes the litre as a unit of volume where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube thus  1 litre cm3 1000 cubic centimetres 0.001 cubic metres  so  1 cubic metre 1000 litres  small amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres where  1 millilitre

applied to the content of a vessel and to liquids grain or the like which take the shape of that which holds them.4 word capacity has other unrelated meanings as in eg capacity management capacity is not identical in meaning to volume though closely related the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior units of capacity are the si litre and its derived units and imperial units such as gill pint gallon and others units of volume are the cubes of units of length in si the units of volume and capacity are closely related one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre the capacity of a cube with a 10cm side in other systems the conversion is not trivial the capacity of a vehicles fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet for example but in gallons gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft  the density of an object is defined as the ratio of the mass to the volume.5 the inverse of density is specific volume which is defined as volume divided by mass specific volume is a concept important in thermodynamics where the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studied  the volumetric flow rate in fluid dynamics is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time example cubic meters per second s1.  volume in calculusedit  further information volume element  in calculus a branch of mathematics the volume of a region

formulas can be used to show that the volumes of a cone sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height are in the ratio 123, as follows  let the radius be r and the height be h is 2r for the sphere then the volume of cone is  the volume of the sphere is  while the volume of the cylinder is  the discovery of the 23 ratio of the volumes of the sphere and cylinder is credited to Archimedes.7  volume formula derivationsedit  sphereedit  the volume of a sphere is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular disks of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius r is as follows  the surface area of the circular disk is  the radius of the circular disks defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them is  or  where y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value  using y as the disk radius the volume of the sphere can be calculated as  now  combining yields  this formula can be derived more quickly using the formula for the spheres surface area which is the volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells and the sphere volume is equal to  coneedit  the cone is a type of pyramidal shape the fundamental equation for pyramids one-third times base times altitude applies to cones as well  however using calculus the volume of a cone is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular disks of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a cone of height h whose base is centered at 0, 0 with radius r is as follows  the radius of each circular disk is r if x 0 and 0 if x h and varying linearly in betweenthat is  the surface area of the circular disk is then  the volume of the cone can then be calculated as  and after extraction of the constants  integrating gives us  volume in differential geometryedit  main article volume form  in differential geometry a branch of mathematics a volume form on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of top degree whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold that is nowhere equal to zero a manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable an orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form on non-orientable manifolds one may instead define the weaker notion of a density integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form  an oriented pseudo-riemannian manifold has a natural volume form in local coordinates it can be expressed as  where the are 1-forms that form a positively oriented basis for the cotangent bundle of the manifold and is the determinant of the matrix representation of the metric tensor on the manifold in terms of the same basis  volume in thermodynamicsedit  main article volume  in thermodynamics the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state the specific volume an intensive property is the systems volume per unit of mass volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature for example volume is related to the pressure and temperature of an ideal gas by the ideal gas law  see alsoedit  area  banachtarski paradox  conversion of units  dimensional
