meridian  the 180th meridian or antimeridian1 is the meridian 180 east or west of the prime meridian with which it forms a great circle dividing the earth into the western and eastern hemispheres it is common to both east longitude and west longitude it is used as the basis for the international date line because it mostly passes through the open waters of the pacific ocean however the meridian passes through russia and fiji as well as antarctica  starting at the north pole and heading south to the south pole the 180th meridian passes through  co-ordinates   country territory or sea  notes

particularly close to  the gilbert islands and the phoenix islands of kiribati  between north island and the kermadec islands of new zealand  between the bounty islands and the chatham islands also of new zealand  the only place where roads cross this meridian and where there are buildings very close to it is in fiji  software representation problemsedit  many geographic software libraries or data formats project the world to a rectangle very often this rectangle is split exactly at the 180th meridian this often makes it non-trivial to do simple tasks representing an area or a line over the 180th meridian some examples  the geojson specification strongly suggests splitting geometries so that neither of their parts cross the antimeridian.2  in openstreetmap areas the boundary of russia are split at the 180th meridian  see alsoedit  179th meridian east  179th meridian west  prime meridian  notesedit  the word antimeridian can also mean the meridian opposite to any given meridian eg 20 west is the antimeridian of 160 east  7946 the geojson format  v  t  e  circles of latitude meridians  equator  tropic of cancer  tropic of capricorn  arctic circle  antarctic circle  equator
