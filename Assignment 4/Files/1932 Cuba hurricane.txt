1932 cuba hurricane known also as the hurricane of santa cruz del Sur1 or the 1932 camagey hurricane,2 was the deadliest and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in cuban history the only category 5 atlantic hurricane ever recorded in november the cyclone had a path through the caribbean sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the atlantic hurricane season the storms strong winds storm surge and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern cuba where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on cuba significant effects were also felt in the cayman islands and the bahamas with lesser effects felt elsewhere  the tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the lesser antilles on October30, and tracked westward into the caribbean sea reaching tropical storm strength the next day moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the caribbean the storm reached hurricane strength on November2 before a period of rapid intensification ensued on November6, the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a Category5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175mph the storm weakened to Category4 intensity while recurving northeast moving ashore cubas camagey province on November9 with winds of 150mph after traversing the island the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central bahamas islands and near bermuda on November13, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day  as an intensifying hurricane in the southern caribbean sea the storm moved near the netherlands antilles and colombia causing widespread effects a prolonged passage of curacao resulted in the damaging of the harbor fortification the storm lashed the coast of colombia with strong winds and torrential rainfall severely hampering the banana crop in the region and disrupting telecommunications several towns particularly those near the coast sustained significant infrastructural damage marked albeit localized damage to banana crops was also reported in jamaica where strong winds toppled numerous trees in open waters the storms track brought it across numerous shipping lanes largely disrupting shipping primarily in the central caribbean and damaging several ships  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations and impact  2.1 caribbean sea jamaica and northern south america  2.2 cayman islands  2.3 cuba  3 see also  4 references  5 external links  meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  the 1932Cuba hurricane can be traced back to a tropical depression first identified at 0600UTC on October30 by ship observations roughly 200mi east of Guadeloupe.34 tracking generally westward the depression crossed the lesser antilles the next day between dominica and Martinique.3 barometric pressures decrease to as much as 1008mbar 29.77inHg in st lucia confirmed the presence of a developing tropical cyclone.1 shortly after traversing the islands the disturbance strengthened to tropical storm intensity at 1800UTC on October31.3 concurrently as the storm was gradually intensifying the tropical cyclone began to take an unusual course towards the southwest.4 on November2, the storm intensified to hurricane status while north of the netherlands Antilles.3  steadily strengthening the hurricane reached Category2 status on November3.3 during the day the storm passed approximately 50mi north of punta gallinas in colombia the northernmost extent of south America.4 however at the same time the hurricane curved towards the west causing the storm to move away from colombia and Venezuela.3 during the next few days the hurricane rapidly intensified reaching major hurricane status late on November4. the next day the hurricanes intensity was analyzed to have been the equivalent of a modern-day Category5 hurricane while curving northward.3 although the storm was analyzed operationally to have maximized as a Category4 hurricane reanalysis of the hurricane indicated that the tropical cyclone was much more intense than suggested initially based on observations by the ss phemius the crew of which visually estimated winds of around 200mph at the maximum of the storm and measured unusually low pressures.1 early on November6, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds estimated at 175mph during that time the ss phemius recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 915mbar 27.02inHg this measurement was the lowest documented throughout the storms existence as this report did not occur within the hurricanes eye the storms true minimum pressure may have been much less.1  pacing northward the hurricane gradually weakened after maximum intensity on November6 but held its Category5 strength for 72consecutive hours before finally dropping to Category4 status.3 due to a gradual curve towards the northeast the hurricane tracked near cayman brac on November91 a minimum barometric pressure of 939mbar 27.73inHg was documented on the island only slight weakening occurred before the hurricane made landfall on the caribbean coast of cubas camagey province at 1400UTC that day at the time of landfall the tropical cyclone was estimated to have had a minimum pressure of 918mbar 27.11inHg and maximum sustained winds of 150mph with these winds extending as far as 40mi from the center of the hurricane the storm traversed cuba in six hours before emerging into the atlantic ocean late on November9, after which it began to cross the central bahamian archipelago at 0700UTC on November10, the hurricane made a second landfall on long island bahamas with an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day Category3. continuing to track northeast the storm moved east of bermuda two days later.1 on November13, the hurricane began to interact with an extratropical cyclone centered over the canadian Maritimes,14 and later weakened to tropical storm strength.3 the tropical cyclone later became extratropical itself before it was last noted at 1800UTC on November14.3  preparations and impactedit  caribbean sea jamaica and northern south americaedit  the british vessel ss phemius which followed the progress of the hurricane from November5-7 and documented the storms lowest measured pressure  as the hurricane moved slowly through the eastern and southern caribbean the rough seas and strong winds disrupted shipping routes on November6, the american schooner abundance encountered the storm east of jamaica resulting in a destroyed rudder and a beaching on jamaicas morant Point.56 however the ships six crew were extracted from the disabled vessel and were transported to the united States.5 although the ss phemius would later return safely to port in Cuba,1 reports that the ship had lost its smokestack and the relaying of an sos message prompted the united fruit company liner tela to search for the initially missing ship which failed due to poor visibility conditions.57 this was followed by a search operation undertaken by the uss overton and uss swan on November8, the ss phemius was found damaged and later towed to shore by a salvage tug however during the same period of time both the steamer tacira and the freighter san simeon were disabled after encountering the storm requiring towing to safety.9 several other ships in the immediate area were also hampered by the storm.10  some damage was reported in northern south america as the hurricane swept near the coast in colombia rail telecommunications were interrupted near santa marta and banana plantations in the area were believed to have suffered to some extent due to the storms winds and rain.5 in santa marta itself several homes were inundated and automotive traffic was hampered by the storms effects docks on santa martas port were also damaged.11 heavy rains also washed out some railways and bridges further disrupting the distribution of banana shipments.1213 elsewhere along the coast many of colombias seaports were damaged by the storms effects while inland farms suffered extensive flood damage.14 due to sparse reports from the remainder of Colombia,15 the extent of damage in barranquilla remains unspecified,5 with other nearby towns reporting damage.15 the village of sevilla valle del cauca was almost entirely destroyed.16 providencia island just off of colombia sustained significant agricultural damage and the loss of 36homes.4 to the northeast in curacao the passing hurricane destroyed the island harbors fortifications.14 a seawall near the entrance to sint anna harbor suffered partial collapse while a pontoon bridge linking both sides of the harbor was completely destroyed in nearby bonaire a pier succumbed to the driving rain and rough seas.17  with the hurricane threatening jamaica pan american world airways cancelled its flights servicing kingston Jamaica.18 in jamaica the storms passage to the west caused intense winds as strong as 71mph to sweep across the island,19 destroying over 2million trees.20 although effects overall were generally minimal some localized areas on the island experienced as much as a 50loss of banana trees due to the storm.4 the cost of damage on jamaica was US4million.21  cayman islandsedit  the storm devastated the cayman islands especially cayman brac which was inundated by the storm surge which was reported to be as high as 10m many homes and buildings were washed out to sea as a result of the storm and many people had to climb trees to escape the floodwaters 110people died on the islands one of them was on grand cayman and the rest were on cayman Brac.22 the ship balboa also sank as a result of the storm.23  cubaedit  santa cruz del sur camagey province cuba after the hurricane  although no warnings were issued initially the national observatory of cuba voiced concerns that the intense tropical cyclone presented a danger to cuba particularly camagey province as early as November5. however the observatory indicated that forecasting the future motion of the hurricane was difficult as the storms intensity and previous motion was not consistent with climatology.24 on November8, a hurricane warning was issued for the southeastern extent of Cuba.25 as a precautionary measure shipping routes servicing ports in eastern cuba were suspended.26  the town of santa cruz del sur in camagey province was virtually obliterated by a massive storm surge which measured 6.5m in height.27 few buildings remained standing in the area in that coastal town alone a total of 2,870people lost their lives in total 3,033people died in cuba and damage there was estimated at usd million today.27  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  list of deadliest atlantic hurricanes  hurricane flora stalled
