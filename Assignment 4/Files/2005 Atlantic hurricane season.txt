season  2005 north indian ocean cyclone season  atlantic hurricane seasons  2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007  the 2005 atlantic hurricane season was the most active atlantic hurricane season in recorded history shattering numerous records the impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913deaths and damage of about the secoond-costliest on record of the storms that made landfall five of the seasons seven major hurricanesdennis emily katrina rita and wilmawere responsible for most of the destruction stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane the mexican states of quintana roo and yucatn and the us states of florida and louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes cuba the bahamas haiti mississippi texas alabama and tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more the most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the united states gulf coast where a 30ft storm surge from hurricane katrina caused devastating flooding that destroyed most structures on the mississippi coastline subsequent levee failures in new orleans louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city furthermore hurricane stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across central america with guatemala being hardest-hit  the 2005 season was the first to observe more tropical storms and hurricanes in the atlantic than the west pacific on average the latter experiences 26 tropical storms while the atlantic only averages 12. this event was repeated in the 2010 season however the 2010 typhoon season broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year while the 2005 typhoon season featured near average activity  the season officially began on June1, 2005, and lasted until November30, although it effectively persisted into January2006 due to continued storm activity a record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed of which a record fifteen became hurricanes of these a record-tying seven strengthened into major hurricanes a record-tying five became Category4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category5 strength the highest categorization for hurricanes on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale among these Category5 storms were hurricanes katrina and wilma respectively the second costliest and the most intense lowest pressure atlantic

state university and separately by forecasters with the us governments national oceanic and atmospheric administration prior to and during the 2005 season gray issued four forecasts each time increasing the predicted level of activity the noaa issued two forecasts one shortly before the season and one two months into the season drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release nonetheless all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season  preseason forecastsedit  on december 3, 2004, grays team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season predicting a slightly above-average season additionally the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the east coast of the united states and the florida peninsula though the forecast predicted above-average activity the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season.1 on april 1, 2005, after confirming that el nio conditions would not develop gray and his team revised the december forecast upward expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six in addition the chance of a storm impacting the united states was raised slightly.3 on may 16, 2005, 16days before the season began noaa issued its outlook for the 2005 season forecasting a 70 chance of above-normal activity the accumulated cyclone energy value for the season was predicted to be 120190 of the median ace of 87.5 104 kt2.4 shortly thereafter on may 31, the day before the season officially began grays team revised its april forecast upwards to 15 named storms 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes.5  midseason outlookedit  on august 2, after an extraordinarily active early season the noaa released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season the ace value was now forecast to be 180 to 270 of the median the noaa also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity.6 on august 5, 2005, gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast it was consistent with noaas update.7 although neither the noaa nor gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity the actual ace would prove to be 248 104 kt28 277 of the median  systemsedit  see also list of storms in the 2005 atlantic hurricane season and timeline of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season  june and julyedit  hurricane dennis making landfall on the gulf coast  on june 8, nearly two months earlier than when the 2004 season started tropical storm arlene formed in the western caribbean crossing cuba before making landfall on the florida panhandle on june 11. arlene caused only moderate damage although one swimmer was caught in a riptide and drowned in miami beach Florida.910  tropical storm bret formed in the bay of campeche on june 28 and made landfall in veracruz the next morning the storm damaged hundreds of homes and caused flooding which killed two people.11  hurricane cindy formed in the gulf of mexico on july 4. originally thought to be a tropical storm cindy made landfall in louisiana on july 5 as a minimal hurricane dropping up to fivein of rain spawning several tornadoes flooding some coastal areas including coden alabama and killing three people cindy was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis.1213  satellite photo of hurricane emily near peak intensity  on july 5, hurricane dennis formed in the eastern caribbean it crossed grenada before intensifying into a Category4 hurricane the strongest ever recorded in july with a pressure of 930 mbar dennis struck cuba at full force then made a final landfall on the florida panhandle the hurricane killed 89people in haiti and caused usd 2017USD in damage in cuba and the united States.1415  soon thereafter hurricane emily formed in the atlantic on july 11. it entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified to a Category4 storm breaking denniss record for july intensity when its pressure reached 929mbar emily then briefly reached Category5 intensitythe earliest such storm ever recorded in the atlantic emily crossed the yucatn peninsula at Category4 strength before hitting tamaulipas at Category3 strength emily killed at least 14people over the course of its path an estimated usd 2017USD in damage was reported.16  tropical storm franklin formed off the bahamas on july 18. the storm moved northeast and became extratropical off the coast of atlantic canada without ever having threatened land.17  tropical storm gert followed soon after on july 24. gert struck veracruz near where emily had hit a few days before roughly 1,000people were evacuated for fear of flooding but no damage or deaths were reported.18  augustedit  like july august also got off to a fast start tropical storm harvey formed southwest of bermuda on august 3. harvey dropped some rain on bermuda as it moved to the northeast it became extratropical on august 8 in the open atlantic Ocean.19  the tropical depression that would become hurricane irene formed west of the cape verde islands on august 4. the system moved west and north and did not reach hurricane strength until august 14, at which point it became the second cape verde-type hurricane of the season irene turned northeast and briefly reached category 2 status before weakening and becoming extratropical on august 18. it never posed a threat to land.20  eye of hurricane katrina as seen from a noaa hurricane hunter P-3 aircraft  tropical depression ten formed east of the lesser antilles on august 13. the system dissipated the next day its remnants soon merged with another system and eventually contributed to the formation of hurricane Katrina.21  tropical storm jose followed forming in the bay of campeche on august 22. it strengthened rapidly but quickly reached the coast and made landfall in the mexican state of veracruz on august 23, preventing further strengthening jose forced 25,000people to evacuate their homes in veracruz and killed six people in the state of oaxaca two more were reported missing.22 in all damage in mexico amounted to 2017USD.23  play media  in katrinas wake short film about hurricane katrina by nasa  hurricane katrina formed in mid-august over the bahamas it became a tropical storm on august 24 and reached hurricane intensity before making landfall in south florida as a minimal hurricane a few hours later the storm entered the gulf of mexico and intensified rapidly into a category 5 hurricane while crossing the loop current on august 28. katrina made landfall shortly after 0600 cst on august 29 near the mouth of the mississippi river as an extremely large Category3 hurricane Category5-level storm surges the storm had weakened only in the previous several hours caused catastrophic damage along the coastlines of louisiana mississippi and alabama within hours levees separating lake pontchartrain from new orleans louisiana were breached by the surge ultimately flooding about 80 of the city wind damage was reported well inland impeding relief efforts katrina is estimated to be responsible for at least in 2017USD in damage breaking hurricane andrews record in 1992 and making it the costliest natural disaster in us history until harvey surpassed it in 2017. it was the deadliest us hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane killing at least 1,836people. the 1900 galveston hurricane remains the deadliest natural disaster in united states history with a death toll of approximately 6,000.2425  on august 24, a vigorous tropical wave developed off the coast of africa which eventually spawned an area of low pressure the low gradually became better organized and was designated tropical depression thirteen on august 28, about midway between the lesser antilles and africa however northerly wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening and it degenerated into a broad low-pressure area the next day after traveling rapidly towards the north the low regenerated into a tropical depression and shortly after was declared tropical storm lee on august 31. lee was only briefly a tropical storm before it weakened back to a tropical depression the depression degenerated into a broad low-pressure area again before being absorbed by a cold front on september 4.26  septemberedit  hurricane ophelia off the coast of north carolina  hurricane maria led off the month of september and formed into a tropical storm well east of the leeward islands on september 2. maria reached its peak as a category 3 hurricane on september 5, turning northeast and weakening before becoming extratropical on september 10. unusually this extratropical storm strengthened as it moved toward iceland its remnants struck norway where one person was killed in a landslide.27  hurricane nate formed southwest of bermuda on september 5 and moved northeast as it strengthened into a strong Category1 hurricane nate became extratropical on september 10 the storm never approached land although it did interfere with canadian naval vessels en route to the gulf coast to help in katrina relief efforts.28  hurricane ophelia formed as a tropical depression in the bahamas on september 6 and almost immediately made landfall on grand bahama it became a tropical storm off the coast of florida before strengthening into a large Category1 storm and raking a long stretch of the southern north carolina coast with heavy winds and storm surge on september 12 and september 13. the hurricanes eye never made landfall and moved back out to sea before becoming extratropical on september 17 and striking atlantic canada total damage estimates were around USD.29  hurricane philippe formed east of the leeward islands on september 17. it moved northwards reaching category 1 intensity before weakening and dissipating on september 23. no landmasses were affected although bermudas lowest pressure of september was recorded after philippe passed near the island.30  infrared image of hurricane rita near peak strength  hurricane rita formed as a tropical storm over the turks and caicos islands on september 18. the storm reached Category2 intensity as it moved south of the florida keys on september 20. rapid intensification ensued as rita moved into the gulf of mexico and rita became a Category5 hurricane on september 21, becoming the third fourth most intense hurricane ever recorded in the atlantic basin rita made landfall near the texas-louisiana border on september 24. major flooding was reported in port arthur and beaumont texas while cameron and calcasieu parishes in louisiana were devastated offshore oil platforms throughout ritas path also suffered significant damage six people are confirmed dead from ritas direct effects and total damage from the storm is estimated at about usd 2017USD. one hundred and thirteen indirect deaths were reported mostly from the exodus from houston texas and surrounding counties.3132  tropical depression nineteen formed west of the cape verde islands on september 30 but dissipated on october 2 without having threatened land.33  octoberedit  hurricane stan shortly before landfall in veracruz  hurricane stan was the first october storm reaching tropical storm status on october 2 just before crossing the yucatn peninsula in the bay of campeche stan briefly reached hurricane strength before making landfall south of veracruz veracruz on october 4. stan was a part of a large system of rainstorms which dropped torrential rainfall that caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides over southern mexico and central america well over 1,000 total deaths were caused by the flooding of which 80100 are directly attributed to Stan.34  an initially unnoticed unnamed subtropical storm was discovered by the nhc during the postseason analysis this short-lived subtropical storm formed on october 4 south of the azores and was absorbed by an extratropical low the next day after passing over those islands.35  tropical storm tammy led a brief existence before making landfall in northeastern florida on october 5. tammy dropped heavy rains over portions of the southeast united states before merging with a frontal system that would eventually cause the northeast us flooding of october 2005.3637  subtropical depression twenty-two formed southeast of bermuda on october 8. it dissipated the next day although its remnants approached new england and contributed to the northeast us flooding of october 2005.38  hurricane vince formed over unfavorably cold water in the east atlantic near the madeira islands on october 8 as a subtropical storm this hurricane was first recorded by the nhc on october 9 when it became tropical and shortly thereafter it briefly strengthened into a hurricane the storm made an even more unusual landfall in spain on october 11, making it the first tropical cyclone to impact spain since the 1842 spain hurricane.39  hurricane wilma formed on october 17 in the western caribbean southwest of jamaica and rapidly strengthened on october 19 it became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the atlantic basin with 185mph winds and a central pressure of 882 millibars it then moved slowly and struck quintana roo on october 22 as a category 4 hurricane causing very heavy damage to cancn and cozumel likewise after emerging into the gulf of mexico wilma sharply changed directions and passed north of cuba before striking southern florida on the 24th as a Category3 storm then moving into the atlantic ocean and becoming extratropical wilma is directly credited with 23 deaths total damage is estimated at around usd 2017USD, mostly in the united states mexico and Cuba.40  tropical storm alpha formed in the eastern caribbean on october 22 and crossed hispaniola causing major flooding before merging with wilma a total of 42people are reported dead from the storm in haiti and the dominican Republic.41  hurricane beta formed in the southern caribbean on october 26 and strengthened into a Category3 hurricane before making landfall in the colombian islands of san andrs providencia and in nicaragua on october 30.42 as of 2012, hurricane beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than million in damage across four countries  november december and january 2006edit  hurricane epsilon viewed from the international space station  tropical activity declined very slowly as the season wound down tropical storm gamma initially formed on november 15 in the central caribbean and degenerated into a tropical wave before reforming although the storm dissipated on november 20 after having made landfall in northern honduras rainfall from gamma caused 41 deaths in honduras and Belize.43  tropical storm delta formed in the eastern atlantic on november 23 it approached but never attained hurricane strength delta became extratropical on november 28 shortly before striking the canary islands at full force causing seven deaths and toppling el dedo de dios a famous land formation on gran Canaria.44  hurricane epsilon formed as a tropical storm on november 29 in a hostile environment in the middle of the atlantic it reached hurricane strength on december 2 and defied forecasting by persisting for over a week before dissipating.45  tropical storm zeta became the final storm of the season when it formed on december 30, six hours short of tying the record of hurricane alice of 1954 as the latest-forming named storm in a season zeta dissipated on january 6, 2006, having become the longest-lived january tropical cyclone in atlantic basin history.46  deaths and damageedit  see also 2005 atlantic hurricane season statistics  damage in navarre beach florida from hurricane dennis  the storms of the season were extraordinarily damaging and were responsible for significant loss of life total damage is estimated to be about us and an estimated 2,067people were confirmed dead however due to uncertainties in the death toll caused by stan the death toll from the season could be as high as 4,000people.47  the hardest-hit area was the united states gulf coast from eastern texas to the florida panhandle first to strike the area was hurricane dennis which caused in damage along the florida Panhandle.14 hurricane katrina caused catastrophic damage to the gulf coast devastating a long stretch of coast along louisiana mississippi and alabama with a 30-foot storm surge wind damage was reported well inland slowing down recovery efforts storm surge also breached levees in the city of new orleans louisiana flooding about 80 of the city total damage has been estimated at and at least 1,836people were killed by the storm katrina is the second costliest hurricane in us history surpassing 1992s hurricane andrew and the deadliest hurricane in the us since 1928.244849 hurricane rita struck near the same area re-flooded new orleans to a far less degree than katrina and caused extensive damage along the coastlines of louisiana and texas total damage is estimated at about tropical storm arlene and hurricane cindy also struck the gulf coast but caused much lighter damage.912  flooding in new orleans from hurricane katrina  the mexican state of quintana roo was also heavily hit suffering billions of dollars in damage when hurricanes emily and wilma both made landfall between cozumel and cancn wilma was particularly devastating lashing the area with major hurricane-force winds for over a full day and was possibly the most damaging hurricane in mexican history.40  wilma caused widespread heavy damage in south florida causing in damage total in the united States.51 hurricanes katrina and rita had struck the same area earlier causing lesser still significant damage and tropical storm arlene killed one person caught in a rip current.9 hurricane dennis also brushed the area on its track northward.14  in october the remnants of tropical storm tammy and subtropical depression twenty-two met over the northeastern united states causing intense flooding.38  southeastern north carolina suffered some damage from the slow-moving hurricane ophelia damage from that storm were originally estimated at but finalized at only the remainder of the atlantic coast escaped the major storms although some regions were affected by the remnants of several storms katrina ophelia tammy subtropical depression twenty-two and Wilma.29  northeastern mexico including veracruz and tamaulipas was struck repeatedly hurricane emily struck tamaulipas directly causing severe damage tropical storms bret gert and jose also made landfall in the area but caused minimal damage although they did cause 12 deaths.22  southern mexico along with portions of central america suffered heavy flooding and mudslides from hurricane stan and nearby nontropical rains over 1,600people were confirmed dead in total with some towns completely wiped out though most of these deaths were not directly related to the hurricane central america also suffered flooding from tropical storm gamma and hurricane wilma and nicaragua was struck directly by hurricane beta gamma caused million usd in damage to crops no damage figures are available for any of the other storms.47  the island of hispaniola escaped the worst storms however at least 89people were killed in haiti from the effects of hurricanes dennis and wilma and tropical storm alpha the leeward islands were generally spared all the storms,47 although dennis and emily caused significant damage in the windward Islands.47  cuba was struck by hurricane dennis at peak strength causing in damage it was the worst hurricane to hit cuba in over 40years. some areas of cuba also suffered heavy damage from hurricanes rita and Wilma.14  unusual impacts were felt in europe and nearby islands from four storms hurricane maria intensified and affected northern europe as a vicious extratropical storm while hurricane vince maintained tropical characteristics onto the iberian peninsula as a weak tropical depression tropical storm delta struck the canary islands just after becoming extratropical causing extensive damage before reaching morocco as a weak extratropical system in addition the azores were affected by the unnamed subtropical storm at its peak strength eight people were killed by those storms and significant damage was reported as a result of maria and delta although no figures are available.47  economic impactedit  hurricane rita at landfall along with the location of several refineries  the damage had far-reaching economic consequences due to vulnerability of both oil extracting and refining capacity in the gulf of mexico storms led to speculative spikes in the price of crude oil whereas the damage to refinery capacity in the united states caused gasoline to soar to record prices adjusted for inflation governments in europe and the united states tapped strategic reserves of gasoline and petroleum and shortages were reported in the days after katrina in areas heavily dependent on the gulf of mexico for refined gasoline even weeks after the storm prices remained elevated as the shortage in production remained over 1 million barrels per day.24  rita damaged wells in the western gulf of mexico which were primarily exploratory leading to concerns that future production would be damped for some time to come additionally as the storm churned in the gulf forecasters predicted that it would strike houston texas the location of many major oil refineries that survived katrina leading to additional spikes in oil prices before the predictions changed in georgia governor sonny perdue declared days on september 26 and september 27, 2005, at all georgia public schools to conserve fuel for school buses in anticipation of ritas impact however as the storm veered away from houston shortly before landfall damage to refining capacity was not as great as feared.31  agriculture in multiple countries was hard hit by extremely heavy rains from severe storms during the season early in the season hurricane dennis caused significant damage to various citrus and vegetable crops in cuba though the damage was not crippling.14 in central america hurricane stan and associated nontropical storms dropped upwards of 20inches of rain causing in addition to severe flash floods and mud slides heavy damage to crops especially to the banana and coffee crops which were nearly ready to be harvested this caused significant economic disruption in guatemala and surrounding nations as the rural economies are highly dependent on the coffee and banana crops.34 when hurricane beta struck nicaragua later in the season it also caused heavy damage to the banana crop but the harvests had already ended mitigating economic disruption.42  katrina also had significant political consequences as president george w bush louisiana governor kathleen blanco and new orleans mayor ray nagin all came under heavy criticism for what were considered sluggish or inappropriate responses to hurricane katrina on december 14, 2005, congressional hearings began to investigate whether these claims had any merit in addition michael brown head of the united states federal emergency management agency was forced to resign from his post after the organization came under fire for what was perceived as an insufficient response to Katrina.52  forecasting uncertaintyedit  hurricane vince formed in cold waters in the northeast atlantic  a number of storms that formed in 2005 exhibited unusual behavior and challenged forecasters ability to make correct predictions hurricane vince formed farther northeast in the atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record at the timeonly 2009s grace has formed farther northand then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane.39 hurricane wilma became the fastest-intensifying hurricane on record and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong wind shear.53 tropical storm delta hurricane epsilon and tropical storm zeta all formed over the cold waters of the late-season eastern atlantic much like hurricane vince at lower latitudes all three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear and epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation epsilon became the longest-lasting december hurricane45 while zeta became the longest-lasting storm in January.46  records and notable eventsedit  the 2005 season broke numerous records for tropical cyclone activity,54 though it might not actually be the most active season in history since records before 1944 are incomplete.55  number of stormsedit  storm formation during the 2005 season  systems  average  old

records for storm formation in the atlantic more tropical storms hurricanes major hurricanes and Category5 hurricanes formed during the season than in any previously recorded atlantic season  the season was the first season to use and names and when the season ran out of official alphabetical names after the use of wilma forecasters resorted to using letters from the greek alphabet for the first time alpha and delta had been used for subtropical storms in the 1970s.  almost every storm in 2005 set a record for early formation of the twenty-eight storms which formed twenty-two of them qualified as the earliest-forming storm of that number starting with hurricane dennis almost every storm was such record set by dennis was later broken by debby in 2012, which was again broken in 2016 with daniellecitation needed the seasons activity was reflected with a very high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy rating of 250. this total ranks it as the second-most active season on record with only the 1933 season having a higher ace value.56 ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots 63kmh or tropical storm strength although officially subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total,57 the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase  intense stormsedit  hurricane wilma near peak intensity of 882mbar  three out of the six most intense atlantic hurricanes central pressure on record occurred in 2005, topped off by hurricane wilmas 882mbar minimum pressure shattering the 17-year-old record set by hurricane Gilbert.40 hurricanes emily katrina and rita also attained Category5 intensity and hurricanes rita and katrina became the fourth- and sixth-most intense recorded atlantic storms respectively hurricane emily was not originally recorded as a Category5 storm but it was upgraded into the post-storm status by the national hurricane Center.16 the 2005 season is the only season on record with four Category5 storms on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the previous record was only two in addition hurricane dennis reached Category4 status tying the record set by the 1999 season with five

denniss nine-day-old record for the strongest storm on record before august emily was also the first Category5 hurricane ever recorded in july and the earliest by nearly three weeks hurricane allen the high level of activity and strength was reflected in the accumulated cyclone energy value at the end of july at 63 it was the highest ever  additionally seven storms formed before the end of july breaking the record of five set in the 1887, 1933, 1936, 1959, 1966, and 1995 seasons five of those storms formed during july also a new recordcitation needed  late activityedit  after forming on november 29, hurricane epsilon became the longest-lasting december hurricane on record when it maintained hurricane strength from december 2 to december 7. epsilon is the second-strongest hurricane ever recorded in the month of december only hurricane nicole of 1998 was strongercitation needed  when tropical storm zeta formed on december 30, it came second only to hurricane alice december 30, 1954, but later in the day as the latest ever that the last storm of the season formed zeta also became only the second storm after alice to persist through the end of the year and still be active at the start of the nextcitation needed  storm namesedit  main article lists of tropical cyclone names  the following is a list of names used for tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the north atlantic in 2005.  arlene  bret  cindy  dennis  emily  franklin  gert  harvey  irene  jose  katrina  lee  maria  nate  ophelia  philippe  rita  stan  tammy  vince  wilma  alpha  beta  gamma  delta  epsilon  zeta  this was the same list used for the 1999 season with the exceptions of franklin and lee which replaced floyd and lenny the names not retired from this list were used again in the 2011 atlantic hurricane season storms were named franklin lee maria nate ophelia philippe rita stan tammy vince wilma beta gamma epsilon and zeta for the first only in the cases of rita stan and wilma time in 2005 names alpha and delta had been previously used in 1972 for two subtropical storms but this is the first time they have been used in this way this season used fifteen previously unused names the most ever in an atlantic season additionally a subtropical storm that formed in early october was not recognized as such at the time and so did not receive a name vince and wilma were the first named and storms ever in the atlantic basin in the spring of 2006, the world meteorological organization retired five hurricane names dennis katrina rita stan and wilma their replacements in the 2011 season were don katia rina sean and whitney respectively.60 it was also decided it not practical to into hurricane history a letter in the greek Alphabet.61 this surpassed the previous record for the
