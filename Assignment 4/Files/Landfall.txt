landfall  for other uses see landfall  hurricane otto immediately losing its characteristic structure after making landfall in nicaragua  landfall is the event of a storm moving over land after being over water when a waterspout makes landfall it becomes a regular tornado which can then cause damage inland when a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it usually dissipates quickly as it loses the inflow of warm air into the vortex  contents  1 tropical cyclone  2 tornado or waterspout  3 see also  4 references  tropical cycloneedit  a tropical cyclone is classified as making landfall when the center of the storm moves across the coast in strong tropical cyclones this is when the eye moves over land.1 this is where most of the damage occurs within a mature tropical cyclone such as a typhoon or hurricane as most of the damaging aspects of these systems are concentrated near the eyewall such effects include the peaking of the storm surge the core of strong winds coming ashore and heavy flooding rains these coupled with high surf can cause major beach erosion in low-lying areas the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic messcitation needed when a tropical cyclone makes landfall the eye closes in upon itself due to the weakening process which causes surf to decrease maximum sustained winds will naturally decrease as the cyclone moves inland due to frictional differences between water and land with the free atmosphere.2  landfall is distinct from a direct hit a direct hit is where the core of high winds eyewall comes onshore but the center of the storm may stay offshore the effects of this are quite similar to a landfall as this term is used when the radius of maximum wind within a tropical cyclone moves ashore.3 these effects are high surf heavy rains that may cause flooding water buildup along the coast with minor storm surge coastal beach erosion high winds and possibly severe thunderstorms with tornadoes around the periphery  tornado or waterspoutedit  when a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it is reclassified as a tornado,4 which can subsequently cause damage to areas inland of the coast when a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it usually dissipates quickly due to friction and a reduction in the amount of warm air supplied to the funnel.5  see alsoedit  rainband  referencesedit  national hurricane center glossary of nhc terms landfall retrieved on 2009-02-05.  sim aberson and chris landsea subject C2 doesnt the friction over land kill tropical cyclones archived 2009-05-06 at the wayback machine retrieved on 2009-02-05.  national hurricane center glossary of nhc terms direct hit retrieved on 2009-02-05.  glossary of meteorology waterspout retrieved on 2009-02-05.  bruce b smith waterspouts retrieved on 2009-02-05.  retrieved from  categories tropical cyclone meteorologyhidden categories webarchive template wayback linksall articles with unsourced statementsarticles with unsourced statements from february 2009
