of tropical cyclones  tropical cyclones portal  v  t  e  tropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a tropical cyclone in the atmosphere.1 the mechanisms through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those through which mid-latitude cyclogenesis occurs tropical cyclogenesis involves the development of a warm-core cyclone due to significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment.2 there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures least 26.5C atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a preexisting low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear.3  tropical cyclones tend to develop during the summer but have been noted in nearly every month in most basins climate cycles such as enso and the maddenjulian oscillation modulate the timing and frequency of tropical cyclone development.45 there is a limit on tropical cyclone intensity which is strongly related to the water temperatures along its path.6 an average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide of those 47 reach hurricanetyphoon strength and 20 become intense tropical cyclones least Category3 intensity on the saffirsimpson hurricane Scale.7  contents  1

surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to sustain a low pressure center a preexisting low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear.3 while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form.3  warm waters instability and mid-level moistureedit  main article lapse rate  waves in the trade winds in the atlantic oceanareas of converging winds that move slowly along the same track as the prevailing windcreate instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes  normally an ocean temperature of 26.5C spanning through at least a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone.3 these warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems this value is well above 16.1C the global average surface temperature of the oceans.8  tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met for example cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude at the 500hPa level or 5.9km can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection in a moist atmosphere this lapse rate is 6.5Ckm, while in an atmosphere with less than 100 relative humidity the required lapse rate is 9.8Ckm.9  at the 500hPa level the air temperature averages 7C within the tropics but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level giving the air room to wet-bulb or cool as it moistens to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection a wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of 13.2C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1C in the sea surface temperature for each 1C change at 500hpa. under a cold cyclone 500hPa temperatures can fall as low as 30C, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres this also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere roughly at the 500hPa level is normally a requirement for development however when dry air is found at the same height temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres.1011 at heights near the tropopause the 30-year average temperature measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990 was 77C a recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was epsilon of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season.13  role of maximum potential intensity  kerry emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988 to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs emanuels model is called the maximum potential intensity or mpi maps created from this equation show regions where tropical storm and hurricane formation is possible based upon the thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run this does not take into account vertical wind shear.14  schematic representation of flow around a low-pressure area this case hurricane isabel in the northern hemisphere the pressure gradient force is represented by blue arrows the coriolis acceleration perpendicular to the velocity by red arrows  coriolis forceedit  main article coriolis force  a minimum distance of 500km from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis.3 the coriolis force imparts rotation on the flow and arises as winds begin to flow in toward the lower pressure created by the pre-existing disturbance in areas with a very small or non-existent coriolis force near the equator the only significant atmospheric forces in play are the pressure gradient force pressure difference that causes winds to blow from high to low pressure15 and a smaller friction force these two alone would not cause the large-scale rotation required for tropical cyclogenesis the existence of a significant coriolis force allows the developing vortex to achieve gradient wind balance.16 this is a balance condition found in mature tropical cyclones that allows latent heat to concentrate near the storm core this results in the maintenance or intensification of the vortex if other development factors are neutral.17  low level disturbanceedit  whether it be a depression in the intertropical covergence zone a tropical wave a broad surface front or an outflow boundary a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis.3 even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low.3 tropical cyclones can form when smaller circulations within the intertropical convergence zone merge.18  weak vertical wind shearedit  main article wind shear  vertical wind shear of less than 10 ms 22mph between the surface and the tropopause is favored for tropical cyclone development.3 a weaker vertical shear makes the storm grow faster vertically into the air which helps the storm develop and become stronger if the vertical shear is too strong the storm cannot rise to its full potential and its energy becomes spread out over too large of an area for the storm to strengthen.19 strong wind shear can the tropical cyclone apart,20 as it displaces the mid-level warm core from the surface circulation and dries out the mid-levels of the troposphere halting development in smaller systems the development of a significant mesoscale convective complex in a sheared environment can send out a large enough outflow boundary to destroy the surface cyclone moderate wind shear can lead to the initial development of the convective complex and surface low similar to the mid-latitudes but it must relax to allow tropical cyclogenesis to continue.21  favorable trough interactionsedit  limited vertical wind shear can be positive for tropical cyclone formation when an upper-level trough or upper-level low is roughly the same scale as the tropical disturbance the system can be steered by the upper level system into an area with better diffluence aloft which can cause further development weaker upper cyclones are better candidates for a favorable interaction there is evidence that weakly sheared tropical cyclones initially develop more rapidly than non-sheared tropical cyclones although this comes at the cost of a peak in intensity with much weaker wind speeds and higher minimum pressure.22 this process is also known as baroclinic initiation of a tropical cyclone trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process it should be noted that developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbancecyclone.2324  there are cases where large mid-latitude troughs can help with tropical cyclogenesis when an upper-level jet stream passes to the northwest of the developing system which will aid divergence aloft and inflow at the surface spinning up the cyclone this type of interaction is more often associated with disturbances already in the process of recurvature.25  times of formationedit  peaks of activity worldwide  worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when water temperatures are warmest each basin however has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active.26  in the north atlantic a distinct hurricane season occurs from june 1 through november 30, sharply peaking from late august through October.26 the statistical peak of the north atlantic hurricane season is september 10.27 the northeast pacific has a broader period of activity but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic.26 the northwest pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round with a minimum in february and a peak in early September.26 in the north indian basin storms are most common from april to december with peaks in may and November.26  in the southern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity generally begins in early november and generally ends on april 30. southern hemisphere activity peaks in mid-february to early March.26 virtually all the southern hemisphere activity is seen from the southern african coast eastward toward south america tropical cyclones are rare events across the south atlantic ocean and the far southeastern pacific Ocean.28

latitudesedit  areas farther than 30degrees from the equator in the vicinity of a warm current are not normally conducive to tropical cyclone formation or strengthening and areas more than 40degrees from the equator are often very hostile to such development the primary limiting factor is water temperatures although higher shear at increasing latitudes is also a factor these areas are sometimes frequented by cyclones moving poleward from tropical latitudes on rare occasions such as alex in 2004,33 alberto in 1988,34 and the 1975 pacific northwest hurricane,35 storms may form or strengthen in this region typically tropical cyclones will undergo extratropical transition after recurving polewards and typically become fully extratropical after reaching 4550 of latitude the majority of extratropical cyclones tend to restrengthen after completing the transition period.36  near the equatoredit  main article list of near-equatorial tropical cyclones  areas within approximately ten degrees latitude of the equator do not experience a significant coriolis force a vital ingredient in tropical cyclone formation.37 however recently a few tropical cyclones have been observed forming within five degrees of the equator.38  south atlanticedit  main article south atlantic tropical cyclone  a combination of wind shear and a lack of tropical disturbances from the intertropical convergence zone makes it very difficult for the south atlantic to support tropical activity.3940 over four tropical cyclones have been observed heresuch as a weak tropical storm in 1991 off the coast of africa near angola hurricane catarina which made landfall in brazil in 2004 at category 2 strength and a smaller storm in january 2004, east of salvador brazil the january storm is thought to have reached tropical storm intensity based on scatterometer wind measurements.41  mediterranean and black seasedit  main article mediterranean tropical-like cyclone  the cyclone over the extreme southeastern pacific waters in may 2015  storms that appear similar to tropical cyclones in structure sometimes occur in the mediterranean basin examples of these tropical cyclones formed in september 1947, september 1969, september 1973, august 1976, january 1982, september 1983, december 1984, december 1985, october 1994, january 1995, october 1996, september 1997, december 2005, september 2006, november 2011, and november 2014. however there is debate on whether these storms were tropical in nature.42  the black sea has on occasion produced or fueled storms that begin cyclonic rotation and that appear to be similar to cyclones seen in the Mediterranean.43  elsewhereedit  tropical cyclogenesis is rare in the southeastern pacific ocean due to the cold sea-surface temperatures generated by the humboldt current and to unfavourable wind shear there are no records of a tropical cyclone hitting western south america but in mid-2015, a rare subtropical cyclone was identified in early may relatively close to chile this system was unofficially dubbed katie by researchers.44  vortices have been reported off the coast of morocco in the past however it is debatable if they are truly tropical in character.43  tropical activity is also extremely rare in the great lakes however a storm system that appeared similar to a subtropical or tropical cyclone formed in 1996 on lake huron it formed an eye-like structure in its center and it may have briefly been a subtropical or tropical cyclone.45  influence of large-scale climate cyclesedit  see also tropical cyclones and climate change  influence of ensoedit  loop of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical pacific  main article el nio-southern oscillation  el nio shifts the region water up and down welling at different locations due to winds in the pacific and atlantic where more storms form resulting in nearly constant accumulated cyclone energy values in any one basin the el nio event typically decreases hurricane formation in the atlantic and far western pacific and australian regions but instead increases the odds in the central north and south pacific and particular in the western north pacific typhoon region.46  tropical cyclones in the northeastern pacific and north atlantic basins are both generated in large part by tropical waves from the same wave train.47  in the northwestern pacific el nio shifts the formation of tropical cyclones eastward during el nio episodes tropical cyclones tend to form in the eastern part of the basin between 150E and the international date line coupled with an increase in activity in the north-central pacific to 140W and the south-central pacific of 160E, there is a net increase in tropical cyclone development near the international date line on both sides of the equator.49 while there is no linear relationship between the strength of an el nio and tropical cyclone formation in the northwestern pacific typhoons forming during el nio years tend to have a longer duration and higher intensities.50 tropical cyclogenesis in the northwestern pacific is suppressed west of 150E in the year following an el nio event.48  influence of the mjoedit  5-day running mean of mjo note how it moves eastward with time  main article maddenjulian oscillation  in general westerly wind increases associated with the maddenjulian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemispheres summer season.51 there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main cause appears to be the phase of the maddenjulian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.52  influence of equatorial rossby wavesedit  main article rossby wave  research has shown that trapped equatorial rossby wave packets can increase the likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis in the pacific ocean as they increase the low-level westerly winds within that region which then leads to greater low-level vorticity the individual waves can move at approximately 1.8ms each though the group tends to remain stationary.53  seasonal forecastsedit  since 1984, colorado state university has been issuing seasonal tropical cyclone forecasts for the north atlantic basin with results that are better than climatology.54 the university has found several statistical relationships for this basin that appear to allow long range prediction of the number of tropical cyclones since then numerous others have followed in the universitys steps with some organizations issuing seasonal forecasts for the northwest pacific and the australian region.55 the predictors are related to regional oscillations in the global climate system the walker circulation which is related to the el nio-southern oscillation the north atlantic oscillation the arctic oscillation and the pacific north american pattern  see alsoedit  intertropical convergence
