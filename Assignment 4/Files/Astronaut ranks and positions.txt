astronaut ranks and positions  astronauts hold a variety of ranks and positions and each of these roles carries responsibilities that are essential to the operation of a spacecraft a spacecrafts cockpit filled with sophisticated equipment requires skills differing from those used to manage the scientific equipment on board and so on  contents  1 nasa ranks and positions  1.1 ranks  1.2 positions  2 rka ranks and positions  2.1 ranks  2.2 positions  3 international space station positions  4 see also  5 references  6 external links  nasa ranks and positionsedit  ranksedit  members of the nasa astronaut corps hold one of two ranks astronaut candidate is the rank of those training to be nasa astronauts  upon graduation candidates are promoted to astronaut and receive their astronaut pin the pin is issued in two grades silver and gold with the silver pin awarded to candidates who have successfully completed astronaut training and the gold pin to astronauts who have flown in space  chief of the astronaut office is a position not a rank  positionsedit  position  duties  examples  comments  mercury  pilot  overall mission success  mercury seven  as a single-seat spacecraft the astronauts who flew the mercury missions were referred to simply as mercury pilots were required to have experience as a pilot of high-performance jet aircraft and to be no more than 5feet 11inches tall and weigh no more than 180 pounds  gemini  command pilot  overall mission success safety of crew and spacecraft  james mcdivitt  mcdivitt was the first rookie command pilot  pilot  serves as systems engineer copilot and would perform any other mission objectives such as evas during the gemini program  edward white  white was the first american who made an eva vehicular activity  apollo  commander  overall mission success safety of crew and spacecraft pilot in command of spacecraft during launch trans-lunar coast and earth return coast also pilot in command of the lunar module the commander would make the actual descent and landing of lm on the lunar surface as well as the lunar ascent back to the orbiting csm  neil armstrong first man on the moon  backup commander jim lovell commander of apollo 13  command module pilot  responsible for knowing the csm and their systems fully serve as flight engineer during launch phase while commander would be in full control of the vehicle perform navigation and mid-course correction procedures during trans-lunar and trans-earth phases of flight command pilot of csm during lunar orbit phase the mission commander is in control of the lunar module from separation phase until the lm docked back with csm in lunar orbit the cm pilot would also have other objectives during lunar orbit phase such as lunar photography research and study for future landing sites for subsequent apollo missions deploy lunar satellite in some cases as well as being responsible for relaying messages from mission control if radio contact with the lm was lost or weak and also responsible for performing an orbital rescue with the lm if it were to malfunction and not be able to perform as needed to rendezvous with csm as planned for in normal cases but this never was needed however the cm pilot was responsible for docking the two ships together when the lm returned to orbit after being on the surface  michael collins  backup cmp william anders  lunar module pilot  flight engineer of apollo lunar module during descent and ascent of the lm also responsible for its systems during all phases of flight between earth and moon the lmp would callout key information to the commander during the most critical descent and landing phases when all of the commanders attention would be focused out the window and on visually flying the lm to a suitable landing spot on the surface he would also control the navigation computer and other subsystems of the craft while the commander had hands on the controls to fly the ship down manually the last portion of the descent when manual control was taken over from the computer  buzz aldrin second man on the moon  backup lmp fred haise  aldrin was the first of philosophy of science in space  docking module

called cosmonauts after initial training cosmonauts are assigned as either a test-cosmonaut kosmonavt-ispytatel or a research-cosmonaut kosmonavt-issledovatel a test-cosmonaut has a more difficult preparation than a research-cosmonaut and can be the commander or the flight engineer of a spacecraft while a research-cosmonaut cannot.6  higher ranks include pilot-cosmonaut test-cosmonaut instructor and research-cosmonaut instructor.7  pilot-cosmonaut of the russian federation is a title that is presented to all cosmonauts who fly for the russian space program  positionsedit  position
