it has been surpassed by the 1933 and 2005, now tying with the 1995, 2010, 2011, and the 2012 seasons for having the third most number of storms 1887 also featured five off-season storms the season ran through the summer and almost all of the fall in 1887, and was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones only by the seasons of 1933 and the record-breaking 2005. the 1887 season saw tropical activity as early as may and as late as december tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated.1 of the known 1887 cyclones tropical storm one and tropical storm three were first documented in 1996 by jose fernandez-partagas and henry diaz they also proposed large alterations to the known tracks of several of the other 1887 storms.2 later re-analysis led to the known duration of hurricane six and also that of hurricane fifteen being increased.3  ten of the seasons nineteen known storms attained hurricane status however only two of these storms became major hurricanes with sustained winds of over 111mph the strongest reached peak winds of 125mph with a minimum barometric pressure of 946mbar off the east coast of the united states in late august only a few of the storms during the 1887 season did not impact land but there was a low number of deaths  contents  1 timeline  2 systems  2.1 tropical storm one  2.2 tropical storm two  2.3 tropical
