list of category 4 pacific hurricanes  hurricane odile near its peak intensity odile had the lowest atmospheric pressure of a Category4 hurricane in the pacific basins at 918mbar 27.11inHg.  Category4, the second-highest classification on the saffirsimpson hurricane scalenb 1 is used for tropical cyclones that have winds of 130156mph 113136kn. the division of the eastern and central pacific basins occurs at 140W the eastern pacific covers area east of 140W, while the central pacific extends between 140W to 180W. both basins division points are at 66N as a northern point and the equator as the southern point as of 2017, 118hurricanes have attained category 4 status in the northeastern pacific basins this list does not include storms that also attained Category5 status on the scale  numerous climatological factors influence the formation of hurricanes in the pacific basins the north pacific high and aleutian low usually present between january and april cause strong wind shear and unfavorable conditions for the development of hurricanes during its presence el nio results in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear while la nia reduces the number of such hurricanes through the opposite global warming may also influence the formation of tropical cyclones in the pacific basin during a thirty-year period with two sub-periods the first between 1975 and 1989 and the second between 1990 and 2004, an increase of thirteenCategory4 or 5 storms was observed from the first sub-period  contents  1 statistics and background  2 climatology  3

basins  saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale  td  ts  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale is the second-most powerful classification with winds ranging between 130156mph 113136kn. when these hurricanes make landfall impacts are usually severe but are not as destructive as Category5 hurricanes that come ashore.1 the term sustained wind refers to the average wind speed measured during the period of one minute at the height of 10 feet above the ground the windspeed is measured at that height to prevent disruption from obstructions wind gusts in tropical cyclones are usually approximately 30 stronger than the one-minute maximum sustained winds.2  the northeastern pacific hurricane basins are divided into two parts eastern and central the eastern pacific basin extends from all areas of the pacific north of the equator east of 140W, while the central pacific basin includes areas north of the equator between 140W and 180W.3 both basins extend to the arctic circle at 66N.4 when tropical cyclones cross from the atlantic into the pacific the name of the previous storm is retained if the system continues to exhibit tropical characteristics however when hurricanes degenerate into a remnant low-pressure area the system is designated with the next name on the rotating eastern pacific hurricane naming list.5  since 1900, 118Category4 hurricanes have been recorded in the eastern and central pacific basins of these thirteen have attained Category4 status on more than one occasion by weakening to a status on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale lower than Category4 and later restrengthening into a Category4. such storms are demarcated by the dates they first attained and the final time they lost the intensity only two storms hurricane fico in 1978 and hurricane norbert in 1984, reached Category4 status three times or more.6  between 1970 and 1975, advisories for systems in the eastern pacific basins were initiated by the eastern pacific hurricane center as part of the national weather service office in san francisco california at that time the advisories released were written in cooperation with the united states navy fleet weather center in alameda and the air force hurricane liaison officer at the mcclellan air force base following the move of the hurricane center to redwood city in 1976, track files were created and altered by arthur pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. the national hurricane center extended its authority to the ephc in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.7  climatologyedit  the track of hurricane sandra in 2015, which is the latest-forming Category4 hurricane on record in the northeastern pacific basin  a total of 118Category4 hurricanes have been recorded in the eastern and central pacific basins since 1900. only two Category4 hurricanes have been recorded in may in addition to 12in june 22in july 29in august 32in september 18in october and two in November.6 no Category4 storms have developed during the off-season.6 it is theorized that global warming was responsible for an increase of 13Category4 and 5 storms that developed in the eastern pacific from 36in the period of 19751989 to 49in the period of 19902004. it was estimated that if sea-surface temperatures ascended by 2 to 2.5degrees, the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase by 610 internationally during years with the existence of an el nio sea-surface temperatures increase in the eastern pacific resulting in an increase in activity as vertical wind shear decreases in the pacific the opposite happens in the atlantic basin during el nio when wind shear increases creating an unfavourable environment for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic.8 contrary to el nio la nia increases wind shear over the eastern pacific and reduces it over the Atlantic.9  the presence of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the north pacific high in the eastern pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter as the pacific high results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive its effects in the central pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the hawaiian islands due to westward trade winds hurricanes in the pacific nearly never head eastward although several storms have defied the odds and headed eastward a second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the aleutian low between january and april its presence over western canada and the northwestern united states contributes to the areas occurrences of precipitation in that duration in addition its effects in the central pacific near 160W causes tropical waves that form in the area to drift northward into the gulf of alaska and dissipate its retreat in late-april allows the warmth of the pacific high to meander in bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it the intertropical convergence zone departs southward in mid-may permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves,4 coinciding with the start of the eastern pacific hurricane season on May15.10  cooler waters near the baja california peninsula are thought to prevent storms in the easternpacific from transitioning into an extratropical cyclone only three storms listed in the database are known to have successfully completed an extratropical transition.7dubious discuss  Category4 pacific hurricanesedit
