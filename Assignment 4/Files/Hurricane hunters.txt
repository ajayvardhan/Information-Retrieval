the galveston commercial association in the early 1930s. supported by the united states weather bureau the patrol bill passed both the united states senate and united states house of representatives on june 15, 1936.5  1943 surprise hurricaneedit  the 1943 surprise hurricane which struck houston texas during world war ii marked the first intentional meteorological flight into a hurricane it started with a bet  that summer british pilots were being trained in instrument flying at bryan field when they saw that the americans were evacuating their AT-6 texan trainers in the face of the storm they began questioning the construction of the aircraft lead instructor colonel joe duckworth took one of the trainers out and flew it straight into the eye of the storm after he returned safely with navigator lt ralph ohair the bases weather officer lt william jones-burdick took over the navigators seat and duckworth flew into the storm a second time  this flight showed that hurricane reconnaissance flights were possible and further flights continued occasionally in 1946, the moniker hunters was first used and the air force and now air force reserve have used it ever since

squadron four hunters was the seventh us navy squadron dedicated to weather reconnaissance they flew several types of aircraft but the WC-121N victor was the aircraft most often associated with flying into the of the storm the squadron operated WC-121s between late 1954 and 1972.6 VW-4 lost one aircraft and crew in a penetration of hurricane Janet,7 and another to severe damage in a storm but the severely damaged willy victor brought her crew home though it never flew again during 19731975, VW-4 operated the turbine-propeller lockheed WP-3A orion  swan 38edit  main article swan 38  in 1974, a

crew departed clark air base in the philippines with the callsign 38.  radio contact with the aircraft was lost on 12 october 1974, apparently as the aircraft was heading into the typhoons eye to make a second position fix there were no radio transmissions indicating an emergency on board and search teams could not locate the aircraft or its crew all six crew members were listed as killed in
