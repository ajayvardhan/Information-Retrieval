hurricane in october 2000 that caused extensive damage in central america especially in mexico and belize it was the fifteenth tropical cyclone eleventh named storm and seventh hurricane of the that years atlantic hurricane season keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western caribbean sea on September28. the depression gradually strengthened and became tropical storm keith on the following day as the storm tracked westward it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September30. shortly thereafter keith began to rapidly deepen and peaked as a Category4 hurricane less than 24hours later keith then began to meander erratically offshore of belize which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction by late on October2, keith made landfall in ambergris caye belize as a minimal hurricane it quickly weakened to a tropical storm before another landfall occurred near belize city early on the following day while moving inland over the yucatn peninsula keith weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the gulf of mexico on October4. once in the gulf of mexico keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day and a hurricane on the following day by late on October5, keith made its third and final landfall near tampico tamaulipas mexico as a moderately strong category 1 hurricane the storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24hours after landfall  keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in central america which resulted in extensive flooding especially in belize and mexico in guatemala the storm flooded 10 towns and caused one fatality similarly one fatality also occurred in el salvador and at least 300people were affected by flooding in that country thirteen communities in nicaragua were completely isolated after keith made roads impassable twelve deaths were reported in nicaragua all of which were flood-related five people were presumed dead in honduras after an aircraft disappeared near roatn one other fatality occurred due to flooding the storm brought torrential rainfall to belize with many areas reporting at least 10 inches of rain while highest reported amount of precipitation was greater than 30 inches in belize a village reported that only 12houses remained while elsewhere in the country at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged several houses in belize city suffered minor roof damage at least 19people were killed in belize and damages totaled to heavy rainfall also occurred in mexico especially in the states of nuevo len and tamaulipas flooding from keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels throughout mexico at least 460houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred in addition one person drowned due to heavy rainfall damages incurred in associated with keith in mexico totaled to approximately 2000USD. overall keith was responsible for 68 deaths and million usd in damage.1  contents  1 meteorological history  2 preparations  3 impact  3.1 belize  3.2 mexico  3.3 elsewhere  4 aftermath  5

elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west exited the west coast of africa it moved westward across the atlantic ocean without development due to the presence of upper-level wind shear after moving across the caribbean sea a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on September27.2 the next day a hurricane hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of 37mph upon receiving the data the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression fifteen at 2100UTC.3 the nhc later estimated the depression had formed three hours earlier about 70mi north-northeast of cabo gracias a Dios.2 upon forming the depression had good outflow although the convection was not as organized.3 with an anticyclone over the system the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest a motion caused by weak steering winds.4 late on September28, the nhc upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it Keith,2 after another hurricane hunters mission reported flight-level winds of 61mph  hurricane keith near landfall in belize on october 1  by the time keith became a tropical storm it was beginning to undergo rapid deepening,2 fueled by warm waters low wind shear and an organizing cloud pattern.5 there initially was uncertainty in the storms future movement due to a ridge in the gulf of mexico tropical cyclone prediction models differed on their assessments three models anticipated a turn to the northeast toward florida due to a trough while others predicted a continued slow motion to the west-northwest eventually reaching the bay of Campeche.6 after continued strengthening keith became a hurricane on September30, just 18hours after becoming a tropical storm,2 and making it the seventh such storm of that intensity of the season.7 that day an eye began developing as the structure became much better organized.8 in a 13hour period beginning at 1808UTC on September30, keith underwent explosive deepening as its barometric pressure dropped at a rate of nearly 3mbar per hour.2 the nhc noted that keith experienced conditions for strengthening with the exception of the approaching land interaction with the yucatn peninsula.9 the hurricane slowed until stalling offshore eastern belize caused by the ridge to the north and the precursor to tropical storm leslie forming over Cuba.2 by early on October1, keith had developed a well-defined eye about 20mi in diameter with what the nhc described as a appearance.10 later that day hurricane hunters estimated a minimum pressure of 939mbar and deployed a dropsonde that observed peak winds of 176mph based on the data the nhc estimated that keith attained peak winds of 140mph at 0700UTC on October1, while just offshore eastern belize this made it a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane Scale.2  shortly after keith reached peak intensity the eye had moved over portions of belize causing it to lose definition outflow became restricted and the developing disturbance to the northeast increased wind shear as a result keith began to weaken steadily on October1.11 while remaining nearly stationary keith made a landfall on ambergris cay late on October2 as a minimal hurricane shortly thereafter keith weakened into a tropical storm,2 and its convection became limited to the southeastern quadrant.12 at 0300UTC, the storm made its second landfall about 29mi north of belize city and within nine hours weakened into a tropical depression.2 the building ridge to the north caused the system to accelerate more to the west-northwest across the yucatn peninsula.13 early on October4, keith emerged into the bay of Campeche,2 where favorable conditions allowed convection to quickly redevelop.14 later that day it re-intensified into a tropical storm,2 with improved outflow and convective organization.15 on October5, the hurricane hunters reported a circular eye had reformed along with winds supporting an upgrade to hurricane status.16 keith intensified further that day until it made its final landfall 23mi north of tampico with winds of 90mph it rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern Mexico,17 dissipating late on October6.2  preparationsedit  on September29, shortly after keith formed a hurricane watch was issued for the yucatn peninsula from chetumal to cabo catoche in quintana roo the next day as keith was nearing hurricane intensity the watch was upgraded to a warning and a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the belize coastline from belize city to the mexican border at that time the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift hurricane warnings were issued for the belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands the warnings for the yucatn peninsula were dropped as keith weakened.2  on October2, the government of belize declared a state of emergency and activated the entire belize defence force due to the storms threat.18 the airport in belize city was closed during keiths passage limiting transportation from the countrys mainland to its offshore islands.19 in corozal belize authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in orange Walk.20 officials were also ordered evacuations for belize city setting up shelters in Belmopan.21 overall about 25,000people evacuate or about 10 of belizes population.22 three hospitals were evacuated in the country.23 in a post-storm assessment residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.24  in quintana roo 5,000people from chetumal and surrounding low-lying areas were forced to evacuate to 30shelters.2526 offshore along a coral reef about 50fishermen stayed on a coral reef during the storm.25 in the bay of campeche pemex evacuated about 6,300workers from its offshore oil platforms.27 officials in yucatn and veracruz declared states of emergency.18 when keith reached the gulf of mexico and began re-intensifying a hurricane warning was issued from tuxpan to matamoros in northeastern mexico with a tropical storm watch issued northward to port mansfield Texas.2 about 3,000residents in tamaulipas evacuated to 250shelters, and in neighboring veracruz about 175people left their houses before the storm struck the threat of hurricane keith caused mexican authorities to close most ports along the gulf coast,28 and many schools in the area were closed.29

the bay of chetumal there were reports of people walking onto the temporarily dry bay floor despite the potential for the waters to return in the event of shifting winds at caye caulker the hurricane produced a 4ft storm surge from the west winds were unofficially estimated to have reached 125mph in the offshore islands of belize wind gusts on the mainland reached 61mph at philip s w goldson international airport due to its slow motion keith dropped heavy rainfall amounting to over 10in in many parts of the country the highest recorded precipitation total was 32.67 inches at the international airport in belize City.2  the strong winds destroyed 130houses in Belize.22 two hotel roofs were wrecked and the winds knocked down trees and power lines widespread areas of belize lost power and telephone service including belize city there the heavy rainfall flooded streets,26 reaching 3ft deep.33 twenty homes were damaged to some degree in the capital while many more suffered minor roof damage.20 the rains flooded the first floor of the primary hospital in the city,34 causing severe damage.35 nationwide 11health facilities were damaged.36 elsewhere in the country the rains increased levels along rivers,18 including the belize river rio hondo and new River.37 the belize river rose for several days after the storm,38 reaching record levels of 21ft in width,37 which isolated 15villages.39 flooding covered northern highway and western highway as well as the primary bridge from belmopan to the rest of cayo District.40 residual floodwaters persisted due to the low-lying land of the country and poor drainage.41 floods contaminated water supply in the northern four districts,42 causing an e coli outbreak and food poisoning.43 in belize corozal and orange walk districts about 30 of the houses were severely damaged by flooding.42  damage was heaviest in the northern offshore islands and in the northern portion of the mainland.44 on the offshore islands downed trees and power lines blocked most roads.42 in caye caulker and san pedro keith damaged the roofs of about 90 of houses and damaged or destroyed 676houses,28 leaving 3,279people homeless.42

country approximately 3,279homes were either damaged or destroyed.47 the damage total from keith was initially estimated at about half of which to tourism facilities the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage.48 about 75 of the crops in the country were damaged including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October.47 the damage total was later estimated at most of it on the offshore ambergris cay and caye Caulker.2  mexicoedit  damage totals in mexico  in thousands of mexican pesos year 2000, unadjusted for inflation32  state  direct damage

77.46ft slightly under the 1976 record this rainfall caused the las nimas dam to catch 525,000 acre feet of water between october 5 and october 17 however some of this water had to be released as the upstream face of the dam was damaged by debris and had to be repaired overall the storm produced in damage mxn 2000USD in the state.32  in nuevo len the remnants of keith interacted with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall,49 reaching 14.43in in Sabinas.2 the average precipitation in the state was 5 inches and the deluge caused causing mudslides in several cities including san pedro guadalupe

the damage from Keith.22 united nations development programme received from the government of norway to give immediate relief to the country of belize united nations childrens fund also gave out for relief in areas not focused on by other relief groups.64 the peace corps the red cross and the united states navy black hawk helicopters worked together to deliver rice corn sugar salt cooking oil toilet paper and medications to about 700families in bermuda landings and adjacent isolated villages the american red cross donated about and 4,080family hygiene kits.47 between october and november

determining the needs in the affected residents due to cut communications.45 the government sent planes with emergency supplies to the most affected offshore islands.67 several emergency teams were sent to caye caulker and san pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after keiths occurrence the belize international airport was back online by the morning of october 4, only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area.66 by that time boat service was re-instated with the most affected areas to pick up stranded tourists.67 workers quickly restored power and water in belize City.43 in the days after the storm struck residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease.35 in orange walk and cayo district
