philippine sea spawned a disturbance on july 29. after initial status as a disturbance tropical depression 04W moved southwestward for 36hours as the structure of the system began to organize on july 31, the depression slowed down and began to rapidly intensify to a tropical storm and was named then it began to turn to the northwest a subtropical ridge prevented nina from turning further north and it began to track west-northwest just before reaching typhoon intensity  nina underwent explosive development on the late hours of august 1. aircraft reconnaissance reported a 65hPa drop of pressure on the same day as well as august 2 with wind speeds increasing from a mere 65kn 120kmh to 130kt 240kmh during that period and it attained its peak intensity of 135kn 250kmh later that day the typhoon began to weaken as it approached taiwan making landfall near the coastal city of hualien as a Category3 storm with 100kn 185kmh winds.1  the storm began to weaken as it battered across the islands central mountain range sparing the most populated areas from the eyewall it entered the formosa straits as a weak typhoon and the storm came ashore near jinjiang fujian China.2 after moving toward the northwest and crossing jiangxi it turned north on the night of august 5 near changde hunan a day later the storm moved over xinyang henan and later was blocked by a cold front near zhumadian henan for three days.3 the stationary thunderstorm system brought heavy rainfall causing the infamous collapse of the banqiao dam the storm moved southwest on august 8, and dissipated soon afterwards.4

near where the system struck land.5 further inland the remnants of the storm produced widespread torrential rainfall with more than 400mm falling across an area of 19,410km2 the heaviest rainfall was recorded along the banqiao dam where 1,631mm of rain fell 830mm of which fell in a six-hour span.10 these rains led to the collapse of the banqiao dam which received 1-in-2000-year flood conditions in all 62 dams failed during the disaster causing large temporary lakes and billion in damage.11  see alsoedit  list of tropical cyclones  banqiao dam  cyclone nargis  referencesedit  copy archived from
