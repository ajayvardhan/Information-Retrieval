remaining a tropical cyclone the seventh named storm of the 1978 atlantic hurricane season greta formed from a tropical wave just northwest of trinidad on September13, and despite being in a climatologically unfavorable area gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward on September16, it became a hurricane south of jamaica two days later the well-defined eye approached northeastern honduras but veered to the northwest after reaching peak winds of 130mph that day greta weakened while paralleling the northern honduras coast just offshore on September19, it made landfall on belize near dangriga and quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing guatemala and southeastern mexico after entering the eastern pacific the system re-intensified into a hurricane and was renamed olivia which weakened before dissipating over chiapas on September23.  taking a similar path to hurricane fifi four years prior greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic storm however damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared in honduras about 1,200homes were damaged about half of which in towns along the coastline the storm damaged about 75 of the houses on roatn along the offshore bay islands and there was one death in the country in the belize barrier reef greta downed trees and produced high waves while on the mainland there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge in dangriga where it made landfall the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125houses and the primary hospital in belize city a tornado flipped

across the atlantic ocean the wave spawned an area of convection three days later which gradually organized on September13, the wave moved through the windward islands producing wind gusts of 50mph on barbados later that day it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75mi west-northwest of trinidad based on ship and land reports though located in a climatologically unfavorable area the depression intensified and continued to develop a hurricane hunters flight on September14 indicated that the depression intensified into tropical storm greta to the north of the netherlands Antilles.1  after becoming a tropical storm greta intensified slowly due to a strong trough to the northwest,1 and with the south american coastline located to the south the southerly inflow was disrupted.2 with a ridge to the north along the 30th parallel the storm moved quickly west-northwestward across the Caribbean.3 on September16, greta intensified into a hurricane about 275mi south of Jamaica.1 shortly thereafter the trough to the northwest weakened which had been preventing the storms intensification.1 an increasingly well-defined eye developed while approaching the coast of honduras as the barometric pressure quickly dropped.4 early on September18, the eyewall passed just offshore cabo gracias a dios the sparsely populated border between honduras and Nicaragua45 the nhc described the eye as having ricocheted off of the protruding northeast coast of honduras thus sparing much of the country from the strongest winds at 0710UTC on September18, the hurricane hunters observed a minimum pressure of 947mbar just off the northern honduras coast which was the basis for the estimated peak intensity of 130mph this made it a category 4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind Scale.6  satellite image of hurricane olivia in the eastern pacific  despite the proximity to land greta initially maintained a well-defined structure the hurricane continued generally west-northwestward due to the ridge to the north and initially was expected to enter the bay of Campeche.7 after passing through the bay islands off northern Honduras,5 greta weakened slightly while approaching belize and made landfall near dangriga at 0000UTC on September19,4 with winds of about 110mph the calm of the eye was reported for three to five minutes there.8 rapidly weakening over land the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over guatemala within 12hours of landfall a large high pressure area from the carolinas to the central gulf of mexico turned greta southwestward toward the eastern pacific Ocean.9 at 0000UTC on September20, the eastern pacific hurricane center took over responsibility for issuing advisories while greta was 30mi from the coast soon after the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern pacific and re-intensified at 0600UTC, the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named olivia by the ephc after initially moving to the north olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop based on observations from nearby ships and radar it is estimated olivia attained hurricane status early on September22. while tracking towards the mexican coastline the system weakened below hurricane threshold between 1900 and 2000UTC, olivia made landfall about 60mi east of salina cruz early on September23, olivia dissipated over the mexican state of Chiapas.10  hurricane gretaolivia was a rare crossover storm from the atlantic to the pacific one of ten named storms to maintain tropical cyclone status during the crossing.611  impactedit  image of hurricane greta north of honduras  early in its duration greta produced heavy rainfall in the netherlands antilles but the strongest winds remained north of the island.1  late on September17 when gretas eye was just offshore honduras the countrys government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern coastline around the same time the mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern yucatn peninsula,12 and on September18 a hurricane warning was issued for the belize and guatemala coastlines.13 these advanced warnings helped reduce fatalities.9 in puerto castilla honduras about 2,000people were evacuated in advance of the storm.14 the honduran government put its military police and red cross on standby in advance of the storm due to fears of a repeat of hurricane fifi in 1974.15 however unlike fifi which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track greta did not cause as significant river flooding in Honduras.45  across much of gretas track in central america the hurricane dropped locally heavy rainfall.9 when greta passed just offshore northeastern honduras it produced sustained winds of 80mph in puerto lempira with gusts to 115mph winds along the northern honduras coast were diminished due to the eyewall passing to the north.4 in honduras meteorologists estimated that upwards of 15in of rain fell in mountainous regions many villages were isolated and communication with them was severely hampered.16 in puerto lempira roughly 1,500 of the towns 7,000 residents sought refuge in five large structures during the storm.17 in twelve communities along the coastline military officials reported that 656 homes were destroyed of which 278 were in punta Potuca.18 in the offshore bay islands the hurricane destroyed 26houses on guanaja where many roofs were lost and several boats were destroyed on nearby roatn about 75 of the houses lost their roofs after experiencing wind gusts of 80mph there was one death in Honduras,9 and nationwide the hurricane damaged about 1,200homes, washed out roads and bridges and wrecked coconut and rice crops.20  at gretas final landfall in belize the highest sustained winds were 55mph in belize City,9 with gusts to 115mph at dangriga near the landfall location.21 on the offshore ambergris caye winds reached 60mph and there was heavy rainfall.22 on half moon caye the hurricane damaged the base of a lighthouse and knocked over several coconut trees.23 along the belize barrier reef the hurricane downed palm trees and produced high waves with significant wave heights of about 33ft along carrie bow Caye.24 on the mainland storm tides in dangriga were 6 to 7ft to 2.1m above normal which did not cause much flooding.9 the strong winds destroyed 50houses there and unroofed a further 75,8 including damage to the hospital there were also disruptions to power and water service about 90 of the grapefruit crop was destroyed and 50 of the orange crop was lost.25 tides were 2 to 4ft to 1.22m above normal in belize City,9 which caused flooding in conjunction with swollen rivers.25 the united states embassy was flooded with about one foot of mud.26 there was little damage in the city,25 although a tornado in belize city that damaged four houses and flipped over a truck.27 during the storm the belize international airport was closed.28 farther inland strong winds caused heavy damage at guanacaste national Park.23 damage throughout belize was estimated at and there were four deaths.9 three of the deaths were on offshore islands in areas without radios and the other was due to electrocution.29  aftermathedit  following the storm damage in honduras the country requested help from the united states the tactical air command had sent two squadrons to central america in the middle of 1978, and in response to the request from honduras two aircraft delivered over 100,000lb of cots water and generators the units also deployed a 13person crew who specialized in disaster relief the aid was distributed by the military of Honduras.20  in late october 1978, the united methodist church sent books and other supplies via aircraft to belize after a youth group rode out the storm there and desired to help residents.30 despite the hurricane damage the economy of belize continued to grow after greta struck including an increase in banana production.31  although the national hurricane center does not consider it retired,32 the world meteorological organization lists greta in its retired hurricane name list.33  see alsoedit  tropical cyclones portal  other storms named greta  other storms named olivia  list of atlanticpacific crossover hurricanes  hurricane edith another hurricane
