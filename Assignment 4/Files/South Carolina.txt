area about 40,000 years ago at the time europeans arrived marking the end of the pre-columbian era around 1600, there were many separate native american tribes the largest being the cherokee and the catawba and the total population being up to 20,000.8  up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of siouan background along the savannah river were the apalachee yuchi and the yamasee further west were the cherokee and along the catawba river the catawba these tribes were village-dwellers relying on agriculture as their primary food source.8 the cherokee lived in wattle and daub houses made with wood and clay roofed with wood or thatched grass.9  top left the shores of florida and the future carolina explored in 1500 and showed in 1502 on the cantino planisphere  about a dozen separate small tribes summered on the coast harvesting oysters and fish and cultivating corn peas and beans travelling inland as much as 50 miles mostly by canoe they wintered on the coastal plain hunting deer and gathering nuts and fruit the names of these tribes survive in place names like edisto island kiawah island and the ashepoo River.8  explorationedit  the spanish are the first europeans in the area exploring from june 24 to july 14, 1521 a land around winyah bay named according to the captive francisco chicora in struggle with nineteen other neighboring peoples whose names have been also transmitted without it being possible to identify them with certainty they found in october 8, 1526 san miguel de gualdape near what is now georgetown south carolina it is the first european settlement in what is now mainland usa established with five hundred settlers it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors in 1540, hernando de soto explored the region and the maintown of cofitachequi where he captured the queen of the maskoki and the chelaque who had welcomed him  later map of french florida  in 1562 french huguenots established a settlement at what is now the charlesfort-santa elena archaeological site on parris island the garrison lacks supplies and the soldiers as in the same time in the france antarctique run away some settlers preferring the savagering and a natural life far from the civilization and the atrocities of the wars of religion in may 1564, a second expedition explore the shore from jordan river up to dolphins river and takes possession of the territory from the coast to the palassi mountains middle french transcription of appalachian mountains on june 20, 1564, they founded fort caroline so called in honour of the king of france charles ix  map of 1584 showing guasile chalaqua and joara in the north west of the spanish florida that the conquistadors juan pardo and hernando moyano violently explored in 1567.  on august 28, 1565, the spanish built a fort on the site of st augustine and few days later exterminate the french colonists on the shore of the massacres river because they are not catholic the two hundred men left to guard fort caroline are executed on september 20, 1565. three years later a punitive expedition led by dominique de gourgue provokes a general insurrection of the natives which permanently expelled the spaniards from the piedmont and the cumberland region that they had begun to invest from joara confined to st augustine they are then confronted with hostilities of the english navy.8  colonizationedit  the carolina colony grants of 1663 and 1665  sixty years later in 1629, king of england charles i established the province of carolina an area covering what is now south and north carolina georgia and tennessee in 1663, charles ii granted the land to eight lords proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660.10 anthony ashley cooper plans the grand model for the province of carolina and writes the fundamental constitutions of Carolina.11 his utopia is inspired by john locke the major investor in the english slave-trade through the royal african company  in the 1670s, english planters from bermuda established themselves near what is now charleston settlers built rice plantations in the south carolina lowcountry east of the atlantic seaboard fall line settlers came from all over europe plantation labor was done by african slaves who formed the majority of the population by 1720.12 another cash crop was the indigo plant a plant source of blue dye developed by eliza lucas  meanwhile in upstate south carolina west of the fall line was settled by small farmers and traders who displaced native american tribes westward colonists overthrew the proprietors english landowners rule seeing more direct representation in 1719, the colony was officially made a crown colony in 1729 north carolina was split off into a separate colony  southern carolina prospered from the fertility of the low country and the harbors such as that at charleston it allowed religious toleration encouraging settlements spread and trade in deerskin lumber and beef thrived rice cultivation was developed on a large scale  by the second half of the 1700s south carolina was one of the richest of what were about to become the thirteen Colonies.12  the american revolutionedit  on march 26, 1776, the colony adopted the constitution of south Carolina,13 electing john rutledge as the states first president in february 1778, south carolina became the first state to ratify the articles of Confederation,14 the initial governing document of the united states and in may 1788, south carolina ratified the united states constitution becoming the eighth state to enter the union  during the american revolutionary war about a third of combat action took place in south Carolina,15 more than in any other state.12 inhabitants of the state endured being invaded by english forces and an ongoing civil war between loyalists and partisans that devastated the backcountry.15 it is estimated that 25,000 slaves of those in south carolina fled migrated or died during the war.16  antebellumedit  main article antebellum south carolina  millford plantation an example of greek revival architecture  americas first census in 1790 put the states population at nearly 250,000. by the 1800 census the population had increased 38 per cent to nearly 340,000 of which 146,000 were slaves at that time south carolina had the largest population of jews in the 16 united states mostly based in savannah and Charleston,17 the latter being the countrys fifth largest city.18  in the antebellum period the civil war the states economy and population grew cotton became an important crop after the invention of the cotton gin while nominally democratic from 1790 until 1865, wealthy male landowners were in control of south carolina for example a man was not eligible to sit in the state house of representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 negroes or at least 150 pounds sterling.19  columbia the new state capital was founded in the center of the state and the state legislature first met there in 1790. the town grew after it was connected to charleston by the santee canal in 1800, one of the first canals in the united states  as dissatisfaction with the federal government grew in the 1820s john c calhoun became a leading proponent of states rights limited government nullification of the us constitution and free trade in 1832, the ordinance of nullification declared federal tariff laws unconstitutional and not to be enforced in the state leading to the nullification crisis the federal force bill was enacted to use whatever military force necessary to enforce federal law in the state bringing south carolina back into line  in the united states presidential election of 1860 voting was sharply divided with the south voting for the southern democrats and the north for abraham lincolns republican party lincoln was anti-slavery did not acknowledge the right to secession and would not yield federal property in southern states southern secessionists believed lincolns election meant long-term doom for their slavery-based agrarian economy and social system.20  lincoln was elected president on 6 november 1860. the state house of representatives immediately passed the to call the election of abraham lincoln as us president a hostile act 9 november 1860,21 and within weeks south carolina became the first state to declare secession from the US.12  civil war 18611865edit  the southern economy had been ruined by the war charleston south carolina broad street 1865  main article south carolina in the american civil war  on april 12, 1861, confederate batteries began shelling the union northern or us fort sumter in charleston harbor after us troops refusal to leave the fort peacefully and the american civil war began in november of that year the union attacked port royal sound and soon occupied beaufort county and the neighboring sea islands for the rest of the war this area served as a union base and staging point for other operations whites abandoned their plantations,22 leaving behind about 10,000 slaves several northern charities partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the port royal experiment workers were paid by the pound harvested and thus became the first former slaves freed by the union forces to earn wages.23  although the state was not a major battleground the war ruined the economy under conscription all men aged 1835 45 were drafted for confederate service more than 60,000 served,22 and the state lost nearly one-third of the white male population of fighting age.24  at the end of the war in early 1865, the troops of general william tecumseh sherman marched across the state devastating plantations and most of columbia  reconstruction 18651877edit  after the war south carolina was restored to the united states during reconstruction under presidential reconstruction freedmen slaves were given limited rights under radical reconstruction a republican coalition of freedmen carpetbaggers and scalawags was in control supported by union army forces they established public education welfare institutions and home rule for counties expanding democracycitation needed  in texas vs white the supreme court ruled that the ordinances of secession that of south carolina were invalid and thus those states had never left the union however south carolina did not regain representation in congress until that date  until the 1868 presidential election south carolinas legislature not the voters chose the states electors for the presidential election south carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner on october 19, 1871 president ulysses s grant suspended habeas corpus in nine south carolina counties under the authority of the ku klux klan Act.25 led by grants attorney general amos t akerman hundreds of klansmen were arrested while 2000 klansmen fled the state.25 this was done in order to suppress klan violence against african-american and white voters in the South.25 in the mid to late 1870s, white democrats used paramilitary groups such as the red shirts to intimidate and terrorize black voters they regained political control of the state under conservative white and pro-business bourbon democrats in 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the compromise of 1877 that ended reconstruction  populist and agrarian movementsedit  the state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the populist and agrarian movements of the 1890s. a republican-populist biracial coalition took power away from white democrats temporarily to prevent that from happening again democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes residency and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls by 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls although they constituted a majority of the states population.26 the 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement the 782,509 african american citizens comprised more than 58 of the states population but they were essentially without any political representation in the jim crow society.27  the 1895 constitution overturned local representative government reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government effectively ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegations for each county as each county had one state senator that person had considerable power the counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975.28  governor ben tillman a populist led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites although he controlled democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers during the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another mans proposal that the state adopt a one-drop rule as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known african ancestry  some members of the convention realized that prominent white families with some african ancestry could be affected by such legislation in terms similar to a debate in virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal was dropped george dionysius tillman said the following in opposition  if the law is made as it now stands respectable families in aiken barnwell colleton and orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified at least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge they have sent good soldiers to the confederate army and are now landowners and taxpayers those men served creditably and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way it is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded caucasian on the floor of this convention every member has in him a certain mixture of colored blood the pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose it would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation of scandal horror feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote perhaps obsolete trace of negro blood the doors would be open to scandal malice and greed to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that a or b had negro blood in their veins any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.29303132  the state postponed such a one-drop law for years virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924, forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white  20th centuryedit  children in port royal south carolina ca 1912. some of the children went to school half a day and worked before school and several hours after school and eight or nine hours on saturday  early in the 20th century south carolina developed a thriving textile industry the state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops attracted large military bases through its powerful democratic congressional delegation part of the one-party south following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century and created tourism industries during the early part of the 20th century thousands of african americans left south carolina and other southern states for jobs and better opportunities in northern midwestern and western cities in total from 1910 to 1970, 6.5 million blacks left the south in the great migration by 1930 south carolina had a white majority33 for the first time since 1708.  the struggle of the civil rights movement took place in south carolina as well as other places in the south  south carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the nineteenth amendment giving women the right to vote the south carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on july 1, 1969.  21st centuryedit  as of 2015, south carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in state legislature at 13.5 louisiana oklahoma and wyoming had a lower percentage the national average is 24.3 with the highest percentage being in colorado at 41.34 in 2011, south carolina ranked first in the country in the rate of women killed by men.35  as the 21st century progresses south carolina attracts new business by having a 5 corporate income tax rate no state property tax no local income tax no inventory tax no sales tax on manufacturing equipment industrial power or materials for finished products no wholesale tax no unitary tax on worldwide profits.36  starting january 1, 2013, south carolina was one of the first states that no longer pays for elective deliveries of babies under either medicaid and private insurance the term early elective is defined as a labor induction or cesarean section between 3739 weeks that is not medically based this change is intended to result in healthier babies and fewer unnecessary costs for south Carolina.37  on november 20, 2014, south carolina became the 35th state to legalize same-sex marriages when a federal court ordered the change.38 for further information see same-sex marriage in south carolina  geographyedit  table rock state park in the mountains of south carolina  francis marion national forest in berkeley county  lake marion indian bluff park eutawville south carolina  the state can be divided into three geographic areas from east to west the atlantic coastal plain the piedmont and the blue ridge mountains locally the coastal plain is referred to as the low country and the other two regions as up Country.39 the atlantic coastal plain makes up two-thirds of the state its eastern border is the sea islands a chain of tidal and barrier islands the border between the low country and the up country is defined by the atlantic seaboard fall line which marks the limit of navigable rivers  the states coastline contains many salt marshes and estuaries as well as natural ports such as georgetown and charleston an unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of carolina bays the origins of which are uncertain the bays tend to be oval lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation the terrain is flat and the soil is composed entirely of recent sediments such as sand silt and clay areas with better drainage make excellent farmland though some land is swampy the natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the middle atlantic coastal forests ecoregion.40  just west of the coastal plain is the sandhills region the sandhills are remnants of coastal dunes from a time when the land was sunken or the oceans were higher  the upstate region contains the roots of an ancient eroded mountain chain it is generally hilly with thin stony clay soils and contains few areas suitable for farming much of the piedmont was once farmed due to the changing economics of farming much of the land is now reforested in loblolly pine for the lumber industry these forests are part of the southeastern mixed forests ecoregion.40 at the southeastern edge of the piedmont is the fall line where rivers drop to the coastal plain the fall line was an important early source of water power mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities including the capital columbia the larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line providing a trade route for mill towns  the northwestern part of the piedmont is also known as the foothills the cherokee parkway is a scenic driving route through this area this is where table rock state park is located  highest in elevation is the blue ridge region containing an escarpment of the blue ridge mountains which continue into north carolina and georgia as part of the southern appalachian mountains sassafras mountain south carolinas highest point at 3,560 feet is located in this area.41 also located in this area is caesars head state park the environment here is that of the appalachian-blue ridge forests ecoregion.40 the chattooga river located on the border between south carolina and georgia is a favorite whitewater rafting destination  lakesedit  south carolina has several major lakes covering over 683 square miles the following are the

1015 earthquakes a year below magnitude 3 the charleston earthquake of 1886 was the largest quake ever to hit the southeastern united states this 7.2 magnitude earthquake killed 60 people and destroyed much of the city.43 faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries  climateedit  main article climate of south carolina  a map of the average annual precipitation in south carolina  lake wylie in autumn  south carolina has a humid subtropical climate

not uncommon for areas along the coast the southern coast to receive no recordable snowfall in a given year the interior receives a little more snow although nowhere in the state averages more than 12 inches of snow annually the mountains of extreme northwestern south carolina tend to have the most substantial snow accumulation freezing rain and ice tend to be more common than snow in many areas of

state constitution law enforcement agencies federal representation state finances and state taxes  south carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature before 1865, governors in south carolina were appointed by the general assembly and held the title of state the 1865 constitution changed this process requiring a popular election local governments were also weak but the 1867 constitution passed during the reconstruction era extended democratization by establishing home rule for counties which were established from the former designated districts of the state  the 1895 state constitution overturned this reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegation for each county.28 they are geographically comprehensive all areas of the state are included in counties as each county had one state senator that position was particularly powerful this status continued until 1973, when the state constitution was amended to provide for home rule for the counties during this time the state had changed with increasing urbanization but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.85  the federal court case reynolds v sims the one-man one-vote concept for electoral representation at the state level legislators were now supposed to represent more or less equal numbers of people.85 residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment the home rule act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties with urbanization their governments have become increasingly important in the state.85  several changes to the state constitution have affected the office of the governor and the cabinet in 1926 the governors term was extended from two to four years in 1982 the governor was allowed to run for a second succeeding term in 1993, the state passed an amendment requiring a limited cabinet of whom must be popularly elected  as of january 2, 2016, there were
