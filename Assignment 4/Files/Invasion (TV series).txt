receptionedit  invasion received mostly positive critical reception metacritic gave the season a score of 72, making it generally favorable.1 the show was nominated on the 32nd saturn awards for best network tv series and best television actor for william fichtner it has been included in many too soon lists.23456 in the independent web critic critics at large the show was reviewed as a lost Treasure.7  on a chat live between bullz-eyecom and tyler labine the actor says did get lots of love critics loved it there was quite a huge following by the time we got cancelled it was just the network didnt love it thats all he also acclaimed shaun cassidys writing calling him a genius.8  later labine reiterates his statement about the shows cancellation still to this day dont know why that show got canceled we had great numbers we had a good show good critical acclaim i dont know but it was a really fun show.9  shaun cassidy said a similar statement about the shows cancellation think there were unrealistic expectations that any show following lost should do better but no show after ours ever did do better so i suspect some of the execs may have regretted taking our show off the air to the question all the shows youve created that were canceled far too soon which hurt the most and why cassidy personally picked invasion because was the most surprising  broadcast historyedit
