of gran canaria in the canary Islands.9 in 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name puerto rico de san juan bautista  the ambiguous use of san juan bautista and puerto rico for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants by 1746 the name for the city rico had become that of the entire island leading to the city being identified as puerto rico de puerto rico on maps of the era.101112  san juan and bay puerto rico 1766  san juan as a settlement of the spanish empire was used by merchant and military ships traveling from spain as the first stopover in the americas because of its prominence in the caribbean a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the new world to europe because of the rich cargoes san juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time.13  the city was witness to attacks from the english led by sir francis drake in 1595 what is known as the battle of puerto rico and by george clifford earl of cumberland in 1598. artillery from san juans fort el morro repelled drake however clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city.14 after a few months of
