hurricane edith of 1971. it was the sixth named storm second hurricane and second category 5 hurricane of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season felix formed from a tropical wave on august 31, passing through the southern windward islands on september 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status a day later it rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane and early on september 3 it was upgraded to Category5status by 2100UTC, the hurricane was downgraded to Category4 status but was upgraded to a Category5 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of september 4.  on september 4, felix made landfall just south of the border between nicaragua and honduras in the mosquito coast region as a Category5 hurricane with 160mph winds hurricane felix struck nicaragua on the same day as hurricane henriette struck the baja california peninsula in the eastern pacific ocean which marked the second recorded occurrence that a north atlantic hurricane and a pacific hurricane made landfall

meteorological historyedit  map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale  a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august 24, tracking westward at approximately 14mph with no associated deep convection and a weak low-level inverted-v curvature.23 initially difficult to locate on satellites,4 the wave axis tracked through a moist environment5 and developed an area of scattered thunderstorms by august 25 visible satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning just north of the intertropical convergence Zone.6 the wave continued to develop moderate to strong convection and on august 27 a 1012mbar 29.88inHg low pressure area developed about 830mi west-southwest of praia cape Verde.7 for the next several days the system failed to organize significantly8 however on august 30 the wave became better defined with more representation of the cyclonic turning into the low.9 convection increased early the next day,10 and a hurricane hunters flight into the system reported the presence of a closed low-level circulation accordingly the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression six at 2100UTC on august 31 while it was located about 180mi east-southeast of the southern windward Islands.11  upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was located to the south of a strong ridge resulting in a west-northwest motion the system maintained curved rainbands with expanding outflow and with light wind shear and warm water temperatures the environment favored further development.11 its deep convection consolidated very near the center and shortly after passing over the island of grenada the depression intensified into tropical storm felix early at around 0900UTC on september 1.12 felix quickly strengthened as it developed a small inner core of convection with tightly-wound bands around the center,13 and by late on september 1 an eye feature was observed on satellite imagery.14 based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft the national hurricane center estimated that felix attained hurricane status by early on september 2 while located about 155mi east-northeast of Bonaire.15  hurricane felix rapidly intensifying south of hispaniola on september 2  tracking through an area of extremely low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content felix quickly developed a well-defined eye a symmetric cloud structure and strong upper-level outflow16 consequently the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward felix attained major hurricane status at around 1800UTC on september 2 while located about 490mi southeast of kingston Jamaica.17 rapid strengthening continued and later that day the hurricane attained Category4 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with the pressure dropping to 957mbar 28.26inHg this corresponded to a falling rate of 3.4mbar 0.1inHg per hour which the national hurricane center described as of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed a hurricane hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 14mi a subsequent hurricane hunters flight experienced flight level winds of 175mph with peak surface winds of 163mph reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall surface winds of 189mph were found in its northeastern quadrant although the national hurricane center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds based on the observations it is estimated felix attained winds of 175mph by 0000UTC on september 3 while located about 390mi southeast of kingston jamaica making felix a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale while investigating the hurricane hurricane hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel which forced the flight to abort the mission.19  continuing quickly westward the diameter of the eye decreased to 12mi and the national hurricane center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 929mbar 27.43inHg about seven hours after it reached Category5 status.2 initially felix was predicted to track west-northwestward striking belize before crossing the yucatn Peninsula20 however its path remained nearly due westward subsequently cloud tops near the center started to warm as the eye became less distinct,21 and by 1800UTC on september 3, felix weakened to Category4 status with winds of 145mph on september 4, felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day.23 felix was upgraded to a Category5 for the second time at 1040UTC,24 and made landfall in extreme north-eastern nicaragua shortly thereafter with winds of 160mph by nine hours after moving ashore the system maintained a well-organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands although the winds rapidly decreased26 early on september 5 felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper-level circulation became detached from the low-level portion.27 the system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern honduras and at 0900UTC the national hurricane center issued the last advisory on felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area.28 the remnants of felix tracked west-northwestward over other portions of latin america and eventually dissipated over the mexican state of tabasco on september 7.2  preparationsedit  hurricane felix in the western caribbean sea nearing central america on september 3  upon felixs becoming a tropical cyclone a tropical storm warning was issued for saint vincent and the grenadines tobago and grenada and its dependencies a tropical storm watch was also issued for the northeastern venezuela coast from cuman to pedernales including isla margarita as well as the abc islands.29 the national emergency management agency of tobago was fully activated with 79shelters opened on the island.30 coinciding with the upgrade of felix to tropical storm status the watch for the abc islands was upgraded to a tropical storm warning.31 a hurricane watch was added to the islands early on september 2,32 where several tourists attempted to leave by plane prior to the arrival of the storm.33 early on september 2, the government of jamaica issued a tropical storm watch for the island,15 which was canceled as the hurricane passed far to its south.22 later on september 2, a tropical storm watch was issued for grand Cayman,34 and the next day a tropical storm warning was put in place on providencia Island.35 a hurricane watch was issued for the caribbean coast of guatemala and the entire coastline of belize at 1200UTC on september 3.36  at 0300UTC on september 3, the government of honduras issued a hurricane watch from limn to the hondurasnicaragua border,37 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later at the same time a hurricane watch was extended westward to the hondurasguatemala border,38 and early on september 4 a tropical storm warning was put in place for the same region.39 officials ordered evacuations for citizens in low-lying areas near the coastline by midday on september 3, around 300tourists evacuated from the bay islands department with an additional 400 preparing to leave by plane40 approximately 2,000people were evacuated from coastal areas.41 by the time the hurricane made landfall about 20,000people in honduras left for safer areas.42  at 1500UTC on september 3, about 21hours before its final landfall the government of nicaragua issued a hurricane warning from puerto cabezas northward to the national border.43 about 12hours before landfall a tropical storm warning was issued from puerto cabezas southward to Prinzapolka.39 prior to the arrival of the hurricane officials sent about 140,000lbs of meals and emergency supplies to near the landfall location.44  impactedit  caribbean islandsedit  felix passing aruba  at around 1200UTC on september 1 a wind gust of 46mph was recorded on barbados and around the same time a gust of 44mph was observed in saint Vincent.45 the storm produced heavy rainfall across the windward islands on trinidad heavy precipitation caused mudslides and overflown rivers which destroyed some bridges moderate winds damaged several buildings on the island damage on neighboring tobago was concentrated on its northern portion where several mudslides resulted from the rainfall46 monetary damage on tobago was estimated at 2017USD.47 felix produced gusty winds on grenada which downed several power lines and destroyed the roofs of two houses rough waves also broke several vessels from their anchors.33 in st lucia winds from the storm damaged the roof of a store in castries which collapsed and destroyed 12vehicles.46  in the abc islands the hurricane resulted in gusty winds and heavy rainfall however little damage was reported in bonaire the precipitation left several homes submerged under water in curaao in aruba the winds damaged one house and briefly left a northern town without power.40 hurricane felix produced strong winds and 10ft waves along the north coast of venezuela which left one person missing in puerto Cabello.48  central americaedit  hurricane felix after its landfall in nicaragua on september 4  early reports suggest severe damage in honduras and nicaragua after felix made landfall as a Category5 hurricane in puerto cabezas nearly every structure sustained at least roof damage and many buildings were destroyed along the mosquito coast flooding and mudslides were reported destroying many houses and blocking highways the government of nicaragua declared the northern caribbean coast a disaster area.49 the miskito cays located about 43mi from bilwi on the northeast coast of nicaragua was among the strongest hit areas hurricane felix had not yet made landfall but reached maximum force when it passed over the miskito cays the winds of the hurricane with speeds of up to 160mph destroyed the cays completely pillars that previously formed the base of the houses were the only remains on the Cays.50  at least 133people were reported dead at least 130 of them were in Nicaragua.51 while few details have been disclosed they include at least 25 dead miskito fishermen swept away a drowning death on a boat impact from a fallen tree and at least one indirect death caused by medical complications after birth.49 there were three deaths reported in honduras one of which was caused by a motor vehicle accident caused by heavy rain and landslides and two caused by flooding in the
