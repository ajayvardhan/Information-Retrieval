musabayev and cosmonaut valeri polyakov became the 16th resident mir crew with malenchenko in command the crew conducted medical experiments and experiments in materials science there were many problems during the mission which finally ended with the first successful manual docking of a progress supply ship at mir by malenchenko on november 4, 1994, malenchenko musabayev and ulf merbold returned to earth aboard their soyuz capsule after landing 88km northeast of arkalyk aboard soyuz TM-19 and mir complex malenchenko spent 125 days 22 hours 53 minutes in space.6  yuri malenchenko

to prepare the zvezda service module for the arrival of the first resident crew during the 12-day mission the shuttle crew spent a week inside the iss unloading supplies from both a double spacehab cargo module in the rear of atlantiss cargo bay and from progress M1-3 which was docked to the aft docking port of zvezda after circling the globe for 186 orbits atlantis landed on september 19, 2000,

yi so-yeon similar to soyuz TMA-1 and soyuz TMA-10, soyuz TMA-11 performed a ballistic reentry a reentry steeper than a normal reentry due to a malfunction and landed 475km from intended landing point north of Arkalyk.10 although the crew were recovered with no injuries the spacecrafts hatch and antenna suffered burn damage during the unusual reentry  he accumulated 191 days 19 hours and 8 minutes time in space during soyuz TMA-11 and iss expedition 16 missions  expedition 3233edit  spacewalksedit  expedition 16 flight engineer yuri malenchenko participates in a spacewalk  malenchenko conducted his first and second career spacewalks during the Mir-16 mission he and musabayev performed two spacewalks on september 9, 1994 06m and september 14, 1994, in which the stations external insulation was repaired the first and second spacewalks lasted 5 hours and 6 minutes and 6 hours and 1 minute respectively  malenchenko performed his third career spacewalk during the STS-106 mission to the ISS.11 on flight day three malenchenko and nasa astronaut ed lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk the spacewalk started at 0455 gmt on september 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttles airlock.12 the spacewalks objective focused on routing and connecting nine power data and communications cables between the zvezda module and the zarya module as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer to the iss to serve as a compass showing the space station in respect to the earth this spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the iss assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history.13  expedition 32 flight engineer malenchenko participates in a spacewalk on 20 august 2012.  on november 9, 2007, malenchenko performed his fourth career spacewalk.14 he and expedition 16 commander peggy whitson in us emus ventured into space from the stations quest airlock at 0954 UTC.15 malenchenkos suit was all white and the purpose of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation of pressurized mating adapter and the subsequent move of the harmony node to its permanent location as the first task the two spacewalkers disconnected the station to shuttle power transfer system cables between the destiny laboratory and PMA-2. next they disconnected eight other cables between PMA-2 and the destiny malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with whitson removed the active common berthing mechanism cover that was located at the outboard end of harmony next malenchenko moved back behind the Z1 truss to reconfigure a power system removing an electrical jumper the spacewalk ended at 16.49 utc when the two spacewalkers returned to the iss the spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes  on 20 august 2012, malenchenko together with cosmonaut gennady padalka participated in his fifth career spacewalk.16 tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations installations retrievals and deployments for the spacewalk malenchenko donned an orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe the duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes the spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between space station modules the spacewalk started from the pirs docking compartment module at 1537 gmt the first task for padalka and malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from the pirs module to the forward end of the zarya module the relocation was needed since pirs module will be detached from the space station in the future for the arrival of the new multi-purpose laboratory module nauka the next task completed by padalka and malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite the two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from the pirs module prior to installing them on the zvezda module they also completed several get-ahead tasks the both opted not to take rests during the night passes as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline they retrieved an external experiment called biorisk from the pirs module for return to earth and for added stability installed two structural support struts between the pirs module and the eva ladder padalka and malenchenko then both ingress the pirs module prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure to end a highly successful spacewalk  yuri malenchenko in

manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system progress MS-1 was then scheduled for launch to the iss atop a soyuz 2.1a, on 21 december planned for a launch date of no earlier than 7 february 2016,17 the spacex CRS-8 mission provided the iss with the bigelow expandable activity module two evas were performed during expedition 46.18 he returned to earth on soyuz TMA-19M, and landed on 18 june 2016 0915 UTC,19 after spending additional 186 days in space.20  referencesedit  this article incorporatespublic domain material from websites or documents of the national
