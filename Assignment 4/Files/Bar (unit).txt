as exactly equal to 100,000Pa, which is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on earth at sea level.12  the bar and the millibar were introduced by the norwegian meteorologist vilhelm bjerknes who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting.3  use of the bar is deprecated by professional bodies in some fields the international bureau of weights and measures lists the bar as one of the units authors should have the freedom to use but declines to include it among the units accepted for use with the SI.1 the us national institute of standards and technology deprecates its use except for use in meteorology and lists it as one of several units that not be introduced in fields where they are not presently used.4 the international astronomical union also lists it under units and symbols whose continued use is deprecated.5 as of 2004, the bar is legally recognized in countries of the european Union.2  units derived from the bar include the megabar mbar kilobar kbar decibar dbar centibar cbar and millibar mbar or mb the notation barg though deprecated by various bodies,2 represents gauge pressure ie pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric

now deprecated and conflicts with the use of b denoting the unit barn but it is still encountered especially as mb than the proper mbar to denote the millibar between 1793 and 1795, the word bar was used for a unit of weight in an early version of the metric system.6  usageedit  atmospheric air pressure is often given in millibars where standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined as 1013.25 mbar 101.325kPa, 1.01325bar, which is about 14.7 pounds per square inch despite the millibar not being an si unit meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient after the advent of si units some meteorologists began using hectopascals hpa which are numerically equivalent to millibars for the same reason the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries for example the weather office of environment canada uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps.78 in contrast americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in us reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic stormscitation needed  in fresh water there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in metres specifically an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1.019716m increase in depth in sea water with respect to the gravity variation the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into meters depth according to an empirical formula tech paper 44, p.25.9 as a result decibars are commonly used in oceanography  many engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because in much of their work using pascals would involve using very large numbers  engineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars a bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studies  a tire pressure gauge displaying bar and pounds per square inch  in the automotive field turbocharger boost is often described in bars outside the usa tire pressure is often specified in bar  unicode has characters for U33D4 and U3374, but they exist only for compatibility with legacy asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documents  the kilobar equivalent to 100MPa, is commonly used in geological systems particularly in experimental petrology  and are sometimes used to indicate absolute pressures and and for gauge pressures this usage is deprecated and fuller descriptions such as pressure of 2 bar or bar gauge are recommended.210  see alsoedit  centimetre of water  conversion of units  metric prefix  orders of magnitude  referencesedit  this article incorporates material from the citizendium article which is
