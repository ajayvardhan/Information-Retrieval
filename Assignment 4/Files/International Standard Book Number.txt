international standard book number is a uniqueab numeric commercial book identifier  an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation reprintings of a book for example an e-book a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. the method of assigning an isbn is nation-based and varies from country to country often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country  the initial isbn configuration of recognitionclarification needed was generated in 1967 based upon the 9-digit standard book numbering created in 1966. the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 sbn code can be converted to a ten digit isbn by prefixing it with a zero  a book can be printed without a printed isbn if

use the 9-digit sbn code until 1974. iso has appointed the international isbn agency as the registration authority for isbn worldwide and the isbn standard is developed under the control of iso

isbn and the corresponding EAN13 and barcode note the different check digits in each the part of the EAN13 labeled is the bookland country code  for a 13-digit isbn a prefix element a GS1 prefix so

character or check digit.11  a 13-digit isbn can be separated into its parts element registration group registrant publication and check digit and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces separating the parts group registrant publication and check digit of a 10-digit isbn is also done with either hyphens or spaces figuring out how to correctly separate a given isbn is complicated because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.13  how isbns are issued  isbn issuance is country-specific in that isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded in canada isbns are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging canadian culture.14 in the united kingdom united states and some other countries where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations the issuing of isbns requires payment of a fee  australia isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency Thorpe-Bowker,15 and prices range from for a single isbn a registration fee for new publishers to for a block of 1,000 isbns access is immediate when requested via their website.16  brazil

in other countries obtain isbns from their respective national isbn registration agency a directory of isbn agencies is available on the international isbn agency website  registration group identifier  the registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element one of 978 or 979.11 registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.29 the single-digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are 0 or 1 for english-speaking countries 2 for french-speaking countries 3 for german-speaking countries 4 for japan 5 for russian-speaking countries and 7 for peoples republic of china an example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for bhutan the allocated group ids are 05, 600621, 7, 8094, 950989, 99269989, and 9990199976.30 books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.31  within the 979 prefix element the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with international standard music numbers but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.11 the registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for france 11 for the republic of korea and 12 for Italy.32  the original 9-digit standard book number had no registration group identifier but prefixing a zero to a 9-digit sbn creates a valid 10-digit isbn  registrant element  the national isbn agency assigns the registrant element categoryisbn agencies and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books in most countries a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn however most bookstores only handle isbn bearing publicationscitation needed  a listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published and can be ordered in book form US1959. the web site of the isbn agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.33 partial lists have been compiled library catalogs for the english-language groups identifier 0 and identifier 1.  publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers  by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.34 here are some sample ISBN-10 codes illustrating block length variations  isbn  country or area  publisher

the number the method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for sbns the two systems are compatible and sbn prefixed with will give the same check-digit as without the digit is base eleven and can be 0-9 or x the system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit isbn and does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain an  ISBN-10 check digits  the 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the ISBN-10 check digit36 which is the last digit of the ten-digit isbn must range from 0 to 10 symbol x is used for 10, and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11.  for example for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2  formally using modular arithmetic we can say  it is also true for ISBN-10s that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. for this example  formally we can say  the two most common errors in handling an isbn typing or writing it are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits it can be proved that all possible valid ISBN-10s have at least two digits different from each other it can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits are true only because the isbn is less than 11 digits long and because 11 is a prime number the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error ie if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid isbn the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. however if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.37  in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered non-transposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn it is still unlikely  ISBN-10 check digit calculation  each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit isbnexcluding the check digit itselfis multiplied by its weight descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found the value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which when added to this sum means the total is a multiple of 11.  for example the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615- is calculated as follows  adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 12 x 11 this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so therefore the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is isbn 0-306-40615-2. the value required to satisfy this condition might be 10 if so an should be used  alternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. the remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 its value modulo 11, is computed this remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. therefore the check digit is minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11. taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 0 11 which is invalid speaking the first 11 is unneeded but it may be considered to simplify the calculation  for example the check digit for the ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615- is calculated as follows  thus the check digit is 2.  it is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples  returns isbn error syndrome zero for a valid isbn non-zero for an invalid one  digitsi must be between 0 and 10.  int checkisbnint const digits10   int i s 0, t 0

and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition  ISBN-13 check digit calculation  the 2005 edition of the international isbn agencys official manual38 describes how the 13-digit isbn check digit is calculated the ISBN-13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its weight alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10.  formally using modular arithmetic we can say  the calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit isbn excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. a zero replaces a ten so in all cases a single check digit results  for example the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615- is calculated as follows  s 91 73 81 03 31 03 61 43 01 63 11 53  9 21 8 0 3 0 6 12 0 18 1 15  93  93 10 9 remainder 3  10 3 7  thus the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is isbn 978-0-306-40615-7.  in general the ISBN-13 check digit is calculated as follows  let  then  this check system similar to the upc check digit formula does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. the correct order contributes 3611 19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed followed by a 6, the contribution of those two digits will be 3116 9. however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same final result both isbns will have a check digit of 7. the ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit  additionally if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th, the total will always be divisible by 10 end in 0.  ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion  the conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the ISBN-13 algorithm  errors in usage  publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers.39 for example ISBN0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books ninja gaiden a novel based on the best-selling game by tecmo and wacky laws both published by scholastic  most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase ISBN.40 however book-ordering systems such as amazoncom will not search for a book if an invalid isbn is entered to its search enginecitation needed oclc often indexes by invalid isbns if the book is indexed in that way by a member library  eisbn  only the term should be used the terms and have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided if a book exists in one or more digital formats each of those formats must have its own isbn in other words each of the three separate epub amazon kindle and pdf formats of a particular book will have its own specific isbn they should not share the isbn of the paper version and there is no generic which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.41  ean format used in barcodes and upgrading  currently the barcodes on a books back cover inside a mass-market paperback books front cover are EAN-13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price.42 for 10 digit isbns the number the bookland code is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits  partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit isbn the process began 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 january 2007.43 as of 2011, all the 13-digit isbns began with 978. as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn 10 digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an letter the bar code represents the as a zero and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 979-0 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by isbn  publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the ten-digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit isbn check digit because the GTIN-13 is part of the global trade item number system includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8, the 13-digit isbn falls within the 14-digit data field range.44  barcode format compatibility is maintained because from the group breaks the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10-digit isbns so migration to an ean-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers barnes noble migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005. although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN-13 in north america  see also  asin standard identification number  coden publication
